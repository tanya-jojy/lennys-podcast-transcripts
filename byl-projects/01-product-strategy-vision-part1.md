# Feeling stuck? Here's how to know when it's time to leave your job | Ada Chen Rekhi

## Transcript

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:00:00):
It's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us. Which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard [inaudible 00:00:42] experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ada Chen Rekhi. Ada is an executive coach and also the co-founder of a product called Notejoy. In her coaching practice, she focuses on helping founders scale themselves. Before starting her company, she was senior vice president of marketing at SurveyMonkey. Before that, she started a contact management startup that was acquired by LinkedIn where she ended up leading LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team. Two fun facts about Ada. One, she started her current company with her husband, which we chat about whether that's a good idea or not. Also, her brother is Andrew Chen of a16z fame. In our conversation, it explains how to make better decisions with a framework she calls Curiosity Loops.

(00:01:21):
We do a live exercise around my own personal values. She shares a bunch of advice on how to intentionally and practically build your early career path. How to thrive as a woman in Silicon Valley, when to get a coach and what you can do on your own without one and a ton more. Enjoy this episode with Ada Chen Rekhi after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:40):
This episode is brought to you by Sprig. Next generation product teams like, Robinhood, Notion and Loom rely on Sprig to uncover blind spots in their product development process. Sprig let's product teams collect user insights fast, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. One of the things I love most about Sprig is that they're all about getting product teams the specific insights they need in the timeframe that they need it.

(00:02:07):
As of today's, Sprig is making that even easier with the new and improved templates library. On this podcast, you've heard a lot about how useful templates are for companies as they grow. Sprig partnered with some of the top product teams and product thinkers to build proven playbooks, specifically to solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today from how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow to troubleshooting drop off. Sprig helps you build better products. Sprig now has a library of more than 85 templates that you can use to get started collecting user insights quickly right in your app. I especially love that Sprig builds templates specifically for product teams, and I was really excited when they ask me to create a template around product sense.

(00:02:47):
One of the questions they get most is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to build a playbook along with Sprig on how to do that based on my experience at Airbnb and from what I've learned interviewing top product folks like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to build your product sense. Explore my product sense playbook and the entire Sprig templates library and build better products faster. Check it out today at sprig.com/templates. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/templates. Ada, welcome to the podcast.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:03:20):
Thanks. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:22):
So I've heard such great things about you from a lot of people, including a bunch of guests that have been on the podcast. And you also have this really great event diagram of maybe an ideal guest for the podcast. You've done growth. You've done products. You've started a company. You're also an executive coach to founders. So there's a variety of topics I'm excited to begin too. So thanks again for being here.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:03:22):
Yeah, I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:45):
An interesting thing that I'll start with is that when we were chatting about what to focus on in our conversation, where you're emailing about this, and you did something that I thought was really interesting. You ran something called a Curiosity Loop where you pinged a bunch of your friends and asked them for input in this really structured way. So I thought I'd start there. Could you just share what this process is, so that we can learn how to maybe do it ourselves, this idea of a curiosity loop?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:04:08):
A curiosity loop is essentially going to a whole bunch of people. In this case, I sent out an email very quickly to about 10 or 11 people and asking them, "Hey, here are nine topics for Lenny's Podcast. What are two or three of the topics that resonate with you and why?" And I got back such an incredible amount of information for about 20 minutes of work. I don't normally do this, but I actually showed you some of the anonymized feedback from people really just talking about what resonated and what didn't. So I came out of it just so much smarter, and curiosity loops are my method of doing so.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Often, people ask friends for advice on just like, "Hey, what should I do here? What can I maybe talk about on this podcast?" Your approach had a lot of structure to it. So maybe two questions just like, what is the actual structure to this concept? And then two, just people... You can often ask friends for advice, but you also don't want to over bug them with questions. How do you think about just not over asking everyone questions all the time, but all decisions you want to make? So I guess the question is, when do you use this versus just not?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:05:12):
I think that there are heavyweight and lightweight ways to use this. So the heavyweight way was what I just exemplified by saying, I sent an email and I made a doc. And on the other side, I had all of this really interesting and rich data. The lightweight way to do this is really just make it your ongoing theme of what you're curious about as you interact with people. So maybe it's this thing where every single day as you talk to people, if you have a social topic, you might just bring up the same question over and over again and start looking for are there any differences or surprises in what people are telling you? One of the big reasons why I think curiosity loops are really useful is that it really fights the fact that there's a lot of bad advice out there.

(00:05:54):
And it's not bad because it's not well-intentioned, but it's bad because it's not contextual. So when someone tells you to quit your job and chase your dreams, or they tell you to sit tight and grind through and build some experience before you go off and go start the company that you've always been thinking about starting, which piece of advice do you actually take? Right? A lot of it depends on your situation, what you're considering, what skills and experience you actually have, and curiosity loops actually are this way of really thinking about how do you make your advice contextual. So I'll break it down a bit in terms of how I think about structuring it. So the first piece of a curiosity loop is really just thinking about asking a good question. In the time when I was working at SurveyMonkey in the past, I had this opportunity to spend a lot of time with the survey researchers, and we really talked a lot about what makes a question good.

(00:06:44):
So in this case, a question's good if it's specific, if it solicits rationale, and it's not biased. You don't want to start a question with, here's what I think because people have this tendency to want to please you or to agree with you. So a good example... Well, let me start with a bad example of a question. A bad example of a question is, what should I do with my career next? It's just such a poorly formed question because it's really vague, it's not specific. It puts a lot of cognitive load on other people, and the output that you're going to get from it is probably going to be similarly bad. Garbage in, garbage out. A better example of a question might be something like, "Hey, you know me. I'm a marketer. I've been thinking about doing this webdev thing. So my plan is to quit my job, do a webdev bootcamp and then go find a job elsewhere. Do you think that's a good idea?"

(00:07:45):
There's just so much rich data to actually explore with that. First, are you suited to being a developer? Are webdev boot camps effective? What's the state of the economy in the hiring market right now for junior web developers? And that's an example of maybe a question that's a little bit more specific and gives people something to anchor on. So that's the first piece. The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you. And then after that, you really want to ask the question. And this touches on what you said about how do you make it really lightweight?

(00:08:41):
Ask the question in a way that really gets you a useful constructive answer, but doesn't put too much weight on people. So what I usually like to do is just make it very lightweight. So in your case, I said, "Here are nine topics. Can you pick your top two and tell me why you like them?" Some people went above and beyond and scrolled through and gave me feedback on every single topic. Some of them just said, "Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid." I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer. Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.

(00:09:35):
And then finally, to close the loop, I think a big piece of it is processing that information and then thanking them for it. So a big misconception that people have when they're really getting into this work of asking for advice or input from other people in the community is often that it's really one-sided. I'm asking you for help and you're getting nothing out of it. The reminder that I would have for all of you is that it feels really good to help someone. It feels really good to be heard and give input. And a big piece of that is, if someone comes to you and they said, "You gave me this advice, it changed my life. Maybe it's not at that level, but it really affected my decision and here's how it turned out. Thank you so much." That feels so good, especially if you only spent a few minutes giving them the input that enabled them to make a better decision.

Lenny (00:10:21):
So to summarize, I wrote these pieces down. The concept broadly is if you want advice on a decision you're trying to make, pick some friends and this is... I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:10:55):
I would try to optimize for getting at least three or four responses. It just depends on the nature of the loop. And then you think about what is your response rate. So if you're emailing really busy people that you don't know very well, maybe you would assume that you only get half of people to respond. If you're emailing people really well and it's really lightweight like, yes or no, and here's why, then you might just send out a handful.

Lenny (00:11:22):
Okay, awesome. So it's five to 10 people, broadly sounds like. Oh yeah, you want to make it really quick and easy. So it's like, here's 10 things, which of these two do you think I should focus on? So it's a quick ask as something you recommend, and then just thank them for it after you finish. Is that broadly the approach?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:11:39):
Yep, that's the approach. One thing I want to note is that it's actually really useful for personal things as well. So we framed it in this professional context of, I'm trying to change a job. But one example that I have is when we had our daughter who's now three years old, one of the debates that my partner and I were having was how do we actually set up our estate planning in terms of if, God forbids, something happened to both of us. How should she inherit the state? And my partner was basically saying, "18 years old, she gets everything fully unlocked." I was saying, "Oh, well maybe 25." And we're at this impasse. And we actually just started to tell each other, why don't we, in our day-to-day conversations with folks that we trust in our family, people that we think are smart, that have kids ask people what their perspective is on it.

(00:12:28):
One thing was really telling, no one out of everyone we asked said 18. So that really dragged my partner up. And then the other thing that was really interesting was that we learned a little bit about executive function and the research around it. So executive function, which is your ability to make decisions and plans and be thoughtful peaks at the age of 30, and it's all downhill from there. So bad news for people like me that are older.

Lenny (00:12:54):
And then I'm getting [inaudible 00:12:54] or game over.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:12:55):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:12:55):
Just like I'm-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:12:57):
But if you're thinking about 18, you are so far from your peak. So it dragged us both up in terms of what our set point was to make a decision like that. But we wouldn't have figured that out without a curiosity loop because it's too much work to dig through papers or research or whatever else to try to come to a good decision on it.

Lenny (00:13:14):
So the core lesson here is just, versus just emailing a bunch of people, asking for advice, which I imagine people often do, just what should I do here? Creating a little bit of the structure and even calling it a curiosity loop, I bet, helps people feel like they want to be a part of this and participate and help.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:13:31):
Yeah, definitely. One of the things that I always try to do is I try to explain to people in my ask, here's why I picked you. So for example, I picked you because I really trust you to be a sound source of truthful advice and give me some feedback. So I really value that. Do you mind spending a couple of minutes and just giving me some thoughts on this?

Lenny (00:13:53):
And how often are you pinging people? If you're a friend of Ada, are you getting curiosity looped every week, or how often? What's your rate limit?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:14:02):
I usually reserve it for bigger things. So probably quarterly or anything where I'm having a big debate, and I'm feeling really indecisive.

Lenny (00:14:12):
Awesome. It also makes me think about this idea of a personal board of directors, and this feels like an asynchronous approach to that concept where instead of a call every, I don't know, quarter month with small group, it's asynchronous. Here's an ask I have-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:14:24):
Totally. Yep. I think this is really based off of the marketing concept of customer advisory councils. So when I was working in marketing and product at a startup, one of the things we would always have is a group of our top customers on DM, basically. And if we had really interesting product conflicts, we would actually just go ping a couple of them and ask them, "Hey, we're debating this. Do you mind just giving us your quick thoughts and telling us why?" And then being able to as a marketer come back to the product conversation and say, here is the literal voice of the customer and four or five different verbatims on what people think about this really enabled me as a marketer to have a seat at the table. And the insight and the helpfulness of that was really something I wanted to bring to my personal life as well.

Lenny (00:15:07):
That's really interesting. It's basically user research for your life. User research, you're told don't do what people tell you to do. I guess it's the same thing here, where it's just like, here's advice and then you end up making the decision for your own own life.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:15:19):
Right. Right. Yes. That is the big caveat. Don't do what people tell you to do. Take it as an input and look for the hard feedback. Look for things that you strongly disagree with or are surprises to you. Because to me, I think these loops are more about looking around the corner and seeing if there's anything you missed in terms of the integrity of your decision making process.

Lenny (00:15:43):
Sweet. You said that people told you what we should not talk about. They're like, "Don't cover this." What was in that list?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:15:50):
So I think there were two topics on the list. The first one, it was just how do you onboard and hire and bring people onto the team? And the feedback I got there was like, "There's just so many people who have done this. I'm sure you have some interesting concepts, but I personally wouldn't be that interested in hearing it. And that was really useful to me. And then the other one was actually just about being a woman in Silicon Valley and the experience of that. I actually had someone write, and you probably read this, Lenny, "No. Stay far away from this. There's no winning on this topic."

Lenny (00:16:23):
Oh, my God. Okay, let's touch on that topic rather than, it's going to be great.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:16:28):
Yeah. So let's ignore the advice?

Lenny (00:16:29):
Yeah, let's ignore it. Before we get to that, I wanted to first talk about you. You gave me some homework also ahead of this chat. And the homework was around helping me figure out values and personal values for myself. I did the exercise. So first of all, can you just maybe talk about what this exercise was, and what the goal of it is? And then I'll share what I come up with.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:16:51):
So the homework that I gave you is similar homework that I give to everyone that I work with in coaching, and it's this values exercise. It's this 10 to 15 minute exercise where you're presented with a list of words that might encompass potential values. It's pretty lightweight. You just go down the list, and you pick out all the words that resonate with you, and then we filter them down into groups of values, and then we filter them down into a stack rank and a list. And the output on the end is basically three to five sentences that cover what are the values stack rank that are important to you right now in your personal and professional life? And what I really like is, it's this internal scorecard of what really matters to you in your decision making process as opposed to the external scorecard of status, money, wealth, how other people perceive you, that often we feel really pressured by. So it's this great way to look back and see how well do decisions, or how well do my situations in life align with my values?

Lenny (00:17:53):
Sweet. And what I liked about it is, if someone were to be like, "Hey, come up with your values." I'd be like, "Oh, my God. I'm just sitting here thinking about words and concepts." And it was really helpful because it was basically multiple choice. Here's all the options across tons of categories, just keep picking and then helps you whittle them down. I ended up with six. I feel like that's one too many. Actually, I added a bonus one because it's just one that I really like. But should I read through what I came up with?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:18:18):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Lenny (00:18:19):
So here's what my values, I guess. Choose adventure, stay optimistic, treat others you want to be treated. Classic. Keep getting better, act generously. And added one that my grandma taught me back in the day that has stuck with me, that had nothing to do with this exercise, but I just wanted to have on this list, which is, first do what you need to do, and then do what you want.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:18:44):
I love it. What a great list of values and what stands out to me from that list too, Lenny, is this idea of achievement or status or success. A lot of the things that we talk about publicly, what your LinkedIn feed might look like don't actually show up in your values. And it must reflect in some of the choices that you've made in your life.

Lenny (00:19:04):
Yes, I hope so.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:19:08):
Let me ask you this. Let's try to apply some of the values in real time as an experiment.

Lenny (00:19:14):
Oh, boy.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:19:15):
If you think about a recent decision that you've had to make or a decision that you're facing coming up, can you share what that decision might be? And then let's try to apply the values to it to think about if you were living up to these values, what choice would you make and maybe some of the pressures you might feel to choose otherwise.

Lenny (00:19:37):
So an ongoing decision I have is I have all these opportunities of things I can be doing. Additional things I can be doing. The podcast, this actually was a good example of I never wanted to do a podcast because I really wanted to... Life is good. I was writing this newsletters, doing great, making a living, doing one great email a week. And I was like, "Why would I do anything more? This is good." So I've constantly resisted, I resisted the podcast for two to three years, and then eventually succumbed. And it was a great decision in the end. But now, I have other things that I'm trying to not do, but they're always pushing into my mind space like, a book for example. Of course at one point, and I paused that just so I could have more time for the podcast. So I guess the decision is just like, what should I say yes to versus say no to?

(00:20:26):
I'm looking at my values a little bit, and one of them is choose adventure, which you would think would be just do stuff, just try stuff out. But I feel like maybe it's just a missing bullet point here of, I just want to do less. I'm trying to take on less and do less and cut out and-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:20:44):
That's really interesting.

Lenny (00:20:44):
... simplify. Yeah. Because there's just endless things I could be doing, and I want to spend time with my wife. And now, my new child is coming in a couple of months, if all goes well. So that's where my mind goes when you ask that.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:20:57):
Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe if you were to decompose adventure, what adventure actually means to you and you go into that word list, you might actually just find that some of these opportunities like writing a book, at some point, it doesn't feel like an adventure.

Lenny (00:21:13):
Right. That's so true. The beginning of it is an adventure. And then that's such a good point because yeah, once you start a thing... Something I always say about this content creation life is like, it's easy to start. It's hard to keep it going, and it becomes just this treadmill of just, you have to keep creating awesome stuff basically for the rest of your life. I don't know how you get off the treadmill. Not that I'm complaining, but that's just a reality of this path. So that is such a good point that it becomes not adventurous very quickly. So that's really interesting.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:21:13):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:42):
I guess the other thing is just, what's a cutoff? What am I... I do a bunch of angel investing and so I'm thinking about just stopping that for a while just so I get up more time with my new child and just carve out things that maybe aren't as essential.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:21:55):
So on the values exercise, I think what you've done a really good job of is just really delineating, here are some examples of choices that you have to make. I think that there are some points in our lives where writing a book, it just seems really obvious. It's good for your career. It's the next level in terms of where you go from the community, the newsletter, the podcast and getting to that next level. But where I think there is value is these lists of values can help ground us from those obvious decisions. So in my life, to share a mini example of this, there have been a lot of cases where the next obvious step for me might be to go an executive at a big company and to go chase the dream and continue on the latter climb of my career.

(00:22:40):
As I've examined my own personal values, a big piece of it has really been around prioritizing relationships and really pursuing knowledge and growth on my own terms. And things like independence and autonomy have started to creep up over time, especially once I started a family. It became very clear to me that sometimes the external scorecard of what people think you should go do is very much an opposition of what I actually want to do. Even though it might be objectively better, depending on what scorecard you actually use, I would actually be less happy with some of those outcomes. So I think values are this really nice useful tool to think about how do you make better decisions again to maximize for your own alignment with life.

Lenny (00:23:23):
That's such an important point. It connects back to the course that I taught and then this potential book of, it just feels like an obvious thing I should do. It was great, but it just didn't bring me joy. And other things bring me more joy. So it was a really good reminder of just like, do I really want to be doing this, or is this just a thing that feels like a smart thing to do but maybe isn't for me psychologically? So I love just the reminder of coming back to values as a lens to decide if you want to do a thing versus just, what are people telling you? Smart or... Which just feels like the natural thing to do.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:00):
Yeah, and it's really self-aware of you too. I think too. Cut it off because you start realizing that you're doing this course, and it's not giving you energy or it's not quite the right thing. It's really hard to say no to things.

Lenny (00:24:12):
It is. It is.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:12):
And I don't think we focus on that enough.

Lenny (00:24:14):
Yeah, I've learned how to do that better. I have all these auto templates of ways to say no in different ways. Actually, ChatGPT, somebody's tweeted this that it has all kinds of good suggestions. If you could ask it, how do I say no to my manager who wants me to prioritize a feature? And has all kinds of clever words to [inaudible 00:24:30].

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:30):
Oh. Yeah, that's a great use for it.

Lenny (00:24:32):
The other thing that I realized as we were going through this exercise that I imagine you find also is when you come up with an initial set of values, I was realizing I maybe another value of just keeping things simple, simplifying. And I imagine that's part of the process of narrowing in on what's important to you is you take this first pass and then you try to use it in making a decision and then you realize, oh, there's this other thing that's really important to me and that updates your values.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:57):
Yeah, I think you could definitely use that process to force yourself to make a stack ring and to be really clear, and also change it. Change it. It's yours. So change it over time as it suits you.

Lenny (00:25:08):
All right. It feels like there should be a curiosity loop AI bot with your values that you email, what should I do with this decision? And then it's like, oh, you think simplicity is great? You should not do this.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:25:20):
The next big idea.

Lenny (00:25:22):
There we go. Somebody build that. Okay, so it's funny we went into reverse interview, and then I have to asking questions again. So let's do this. You talked about your career and how you resisted these shiny object opportunities to focus on the thing that you were excited about and wanted to do. So maybe a couple questions there. One is just early career advice. You coach a lot of founders. You had a really in incredible career doing all kinds of interesting things. What have you learned about what works best for optimizing in your early career?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:25:55):
My early career was pretty wild. So I had a really fast run. Over the course of seven years, I went from my first job, which was basically this entry level sales job at Microsoft, working on Microsoft adCenter to SVP of marketing at SurveyMonkey, leading a global team. And when I reflect back on what works across my early career, it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit, which actually sounds dark now that I'm saying it out loud, but-

Lenny (00:26:27):
Yeah, sounds great. I love it.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:26:29):
Explore and exploit, if you're familiar with it from growth background, is really just around what mode you're in. You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it, how well it works, whether or not it fits for you. Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more. And when I think about explore and exploit for early career, it's all about exploration. You really haven't experienced that much, but you're doing it with a thesis. You're doing it with that growth mindset where you have a hypothesis. So coming out of school, my first job was at Microsoft. I was at adCenter. The big thing I learned from the 367 days that I was there was that corporate life at that point in my career was just a little bit too slow-paced for me, and I was really hungry to go do something else.

(00:27:19):
But I also learned quite a lot about marketing and advertising. And I had the suspicion that not only did I want to try something smaller, but I also wanted to try marketing. So I moved to this series a startup where I had to sample my desk on the first day called Mochi Media. And I was in a marketing role at a startup and had this great run there over three years, where I learned all kinds of things and even tried product at some point. What I learned from that experience was then I love marketing, games was pretty fun and being in a smaller team was really dynamic. It was this choice on, do I exploit and go deeper into the industry or do I explore more? I was 23 at the time, so I decided I have so little to lose, let me continue exploring. My big thesis was, let me try being a founder. So then I founded Connected, and Connected was this personal CRM that's a little bit like Clay.

(00:28:14):
If you've seen Clay now recently, in terms of how do you do a better job of managing and building your professional and personal network and-

Lenny (00:28:20):
Yeah. It's a beautiful product.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:28:22):
Yeah, it's a beautiful product, much more beautiful than what we built at the time. It was such a great learning experience to discover what it was like to be a founder of a company and an entrepreneur. My personal learning out of all of those things was really just that I was continuously optimizing that I loved marketing. I loved being a founder. I really like small teams. There are pros and cons to this corporate life, where maybe things are really slow paced, but the scale is really important. So that was really what carried me through a lot of my early career. After Connected was acquired by LinkedIn, I moved into this exploit mode.

(00:28:59):
So I was at LinkedIn for a period of time while I was investing, and I really wanted to be intentional about the time that I spent there in terms of how I wanted to exploit it. So unlike a traditional path where you're really focused on trying to get the biggest title, a big team, set yourself up to run a big org, my role at LinkedIn was really explicit. I even told my manager this when I first came in, "I'm here to learn to be a better founder." So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it. So if I can make my LinkedIn experiences match to that, that would be a huge win for me independent of promotion, or compensation or a whole bunch of those things because the plan afterward is actually to go off and start another company.

(00:29:53):
So I managed to get into this great role leading gross marketing for LinkedIn, working with their growth team from a hundred million to 200 million members, read every experiment brief that I could, spent a lot of time with the team, really understanding their process, and then shifted into the subscription side where I worked on LinkedIn subscriptions and ran their sales subscriptions business at scale through the online channel. And saw how all of those pieces and worked together from a financial planning and analysis stage to all of the optimizations that they did. It was just such a rare opportunity, but I wouldn't have gotten those opportunities if I just let them promote me or I followed a strategy where I was just focused on trying to get the biggest title.

(00:30:35):
Instead, I was focused on those learnings and those experiences. Ultimately, the fact that I was a startup founder. I had big company experience. I had growth experience, and I had subs experience. And I was a product marketer. That was actually the winning combination that caused SurveyMonkey to send me a LinkedIn InMail, start a conversation and ultimately bring me in as their head of marketing at the age of, I think I was 27 or 28 at the time. Because their rationale was, you have all these experiences that we really need and you don't have the management experience, but we have plenty of that. We're happy to teach that to you.

Lenny (00:31:10):
I really like this framework. I've never heard it described this way. Explore and exploit connects a lot with what I always recommend which, early on, is to optimize for a variety of experience so that you can figure out where you actually have a good time and what you're interested in versus getting stuck on the first thing something. I don't know if you'll have an immediate answer to this, but I'm curious. Many people don't know how long to stick with something that maybe doesn't feel good but may lead to something. Like, someone may be in a job right now, or just like, "I really don't like this job, but I feel like it'll lead to something great. And I don't want to give up too quickly." So I guess the question is, what are heuristics that tell you to stick it out and stick with something that you think will lead to something great versus hold the recording and get out?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:32:01):
That's a great question, and it's a really tough one that is contextual on the person that you are. So one of the things that I like to share is this idea of, it's a little gory, don't be the frog. So if you are familiar with the story of the frog, it's this idea of boiling the frog. So if you take a frog, and you throw in a pot of boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you take a frog and you put in a pot and you increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive. And how I apply this to your question to come back and circle back to it is that, it's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them or we think, "Gosh, it'll get better. The next manager will get better. I'm always one conversation or one promotion away from getting to that next step."

(00:33:02):
But you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending. That's what makes the advice really contextual. I really look at it from the lens of learning. What can I learn here, and how am I growing and developing? So there might be an argument for you to stay at a job for two decades. If it turns out that every single day you're being really challenged, you're learning new things, you're deriving a lot of meaningful enjoyment out of your work and you're this happy frog that's hanging out, realizing that things are good and the temperature is not rising. But there are also situations where you might encounter just some really hard walls, where you don't get along with the thesis of the company. You don't agree with the direction of the company that you're in.

(00:33:53):
There are fundamental aspects of the role which are limiting to you or you're not learning a lot, frankly. I think that happens a lot, where you providing a lot of value and doing a good job at a company, but you might not be learning things that stretch you and grow you to achieve your ultimate goal. When you are aware of that learning, I think that's the point at which you have to say, "How do I change that? How do I be an agent in my own career and make a difference in that?" And it doesn't necessarily mean that the strategy is to quit your job and do something catastrophic, and then go do something else, take a course or sign up for something new. It might actually mean a proactive conversation with your manager or the leadership to say, "I love what I'm doing here, and I would also like to learn a little bit more. And here's what I'm interested in."

(00:34:44):
And then try to find a way to either land the right projects. So in my case, it was really growth and subscriptions, that experience that I really wanted. Let's say, you hit a blank wall there, even take it as a gift of time, which is great. I'm not going to be able to get this from my company, but now that I have this extra time because I'm so optimized at this job, how am I going to choose to use that time? And it might be around building relationships with some of the key people at the company or learning something new on your own time that you can leverage in another way.

Lenny (00:35:17):
I like that. Make the most of the time, even if it's not the best opportunity for you. Also love the frog boiling metaphor.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:35:23):
Little gory.

Lenny (00:35:24):
No, it's great. So I guess the lesson there is think about are you that frog being boiled right now and think ahead, is this going to be the end of the-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:35:24):
Right. Keep an eye on your environment and which way is it trending?

Lenny (00:35:35):
Yeah, the temperature on the thermostat in your office. The other thing this makes me think about is, it's so easy to get caught up in making your resume look amazing and continuing to just like, "Oh, if I get this next role, my resume's going to look so great." And this other logo and this cool title and role. I find that just like, you do that long enough in your life, you end up... You retire, and then you die. Life is that resume. Right? That is your life, you're living, and there's not going to be a point at which you have to realize, okay, I've done all the things to make my resume. Also, I'm like, "What do I actually want to do? Am I enjoying this?" Because it'll never end. You're never going to end trying to make a better resume and a more awesome background for yourself. Do you experience that with yourself or other people you work with of just over optimizing to make an awesome series of roles and logos and then forgetting, do I actually enjoy any of this? What am I doing?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:36:31):
I have experienced that personally a lot. I think that it may be a generational thing or it just may be my background, but having grown up with the Asian tiger parenting, it's very focused on logos or certain accomplishments or certain achievements like, going to an Ivy League school, working in a company that someone's heard of, being able to have a certain title. At a certain point, I bailed out a bit and I really started to think about who am I trying to please and optimize for? That values exercise that I had you do, Lenny, is actually a big piece of that. So I probably took it for the first time over a decade ago, at this point. I looked at those values and I said, "Well, if I draw a straight line from where I am right now and just extend it forward and play the rest of the movie as it plays out, given the current plot line, how well does that optimize for those values?"

(00:37:27):
That's great. My parents might be happy about my resume or other people might look upon me in a certain way because I've managed these achievements, but in my day-to-day life, what really matters to me, what's really meaningful to me, only some of this stuff really matters. So getting very intentional about that and being clear about who your audience is as you navigate your career. I think it's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us, which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.

Lenny (00:38:25):
I love this topic. Thank you for sharing that. This episode is brought to you by Sprig. You already heard me talk about how Sprig helps you uncover blind spots in your product development process, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. Just this week, they launched their brand new templates library, which you can find at sprig.com/templates. Which helps you plug and play proven playbooks for helping you identify and solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today. From how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow, to troubleshooting drop off. One of the questions I get most on this podcast and in my newsletter is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to work with Sprig to build a playbook for how to do just that, based on my experience at Airbnb and what I learned from interviewing top product people like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to develop your product sense, which informed this template that you'll find. Just go to sprig.com/templates to find this playbook and 85 more that is sprig.com/templates. S-P-R-I-G.com/plates.

(00:39:31):
What triggered your reevaluation of that path? Was there just like a, "Oh, man. I need to really rethink where I'm going." And then I have a follow-up question.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:39:40):
Really just a career opportunity. And it was this step where I could do something that was, at the time, really high profile and really exciting and felt great, but also involved demanding travel and grueling hours. And wasn't in a space that I was excited about, but it looked amazing on my resume. And I was talking to a friend about it, and they actually introduced me to this values exercise to say like, "Ada, go through and fill out this values exercise, and apply it to this job." What I realized at the time, after I did it, was that my top three values, the things that I cared about this job would categorically just fail at because I would be gone all the time, in pursuit of glory that I didn't really care about. Instead, my current path at the time was something that if I persisted in, it would actually be able to potentially fulfill all of those values.

Lenny (00:40:36):
It reminds me of a friend who has this metaphor of this ego monster sitting in the corner of the room that's always yelling at them, when they're... To do the thing that's impressive and take on the really cool role, and just get an awesome title, and do something really impressive, that's just like yelling at them from the corner. And my friend's just learned to just like, "Okay, that's the ego monster pulling at me. I don't have to listen to that. Doesn't mean I'm going to be happy if I listen to this guy." And that's been really helpful to my friend just to disassociate that part of the brain.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:41:10):
Yeah. The ego monster is a great way to put it. I use something that Warren Buffet has talked about, which is inner scorecard versus outer scorecard.

Lenny (00:41:19):
Tell me more.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:41:20):
So he talks about how there's an outer scorecard, which is how the rest of the world evaluates you, how you keep score in terms of external factors. So top 10 lists, wealth status, title, maybe things that people really care about. And then your inner scorecard is things that actually matter to you, how you spent your day, how good of a person you are. Did you have an adventure today, Lenny? Were you kind? And there are a lot of things that maybe are in opposition to each other. So really thinking about did you win at the cost of kindness? Did you succeed at the cost of losing access to the adventure that you really wanted? I think really thinking about it in that lens helps you trade off against some of that external pressure and the ego monster.

Lenny (00:42:11):
This might be a good segue to chat about coaching. I imagine a lot of people listening to this like, "Yes, I want to do that. I want to measure myself according to my values and check in on this. And am I doing the wrong path?" It's hard to do just on your own, I find. And I think that's one of the benefits of an executive coach. So maybe we just chat about what should people know about coaching and getting a coach, and does everyone need a coach and how to think about the idea of getting a coach at some point in their career.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:42:42):
I'll have a hot take on this, and it's something that I share to people when I talk to them about coaching. But my hot take is that for the vast majority of people, they probably do not need a coach.

Lenny (00:42:52):
Great.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:42:54):
And what I often push people on is if you're thinking about getting a coach, which is usually an indication that they have a feeling of being stuck or they have a problem that they're trying to solve, I ask them, "What are your goals when it comes to coaching? Roll it forward six months, what have you gotten done in your coaching experience. What have you accomplished, and you're just... It's like, a home run. And then look at all of the potential alternatives in terms of how you could have spent your valuable time and often pricey fees to achieve the same goal, but maybe in a better way." The thing that people don't really think about is if you're looking for a mentor, a coach is actually a terrible mentor in some ways because it's this one person's opinion. It's actually way better to run a curiosity loop, for example, and get the benefit a couple different minds on a specific topic and hit their wheelhouse of things that they know about. Than to go ask one person, what do you think I should do in this situation?

(00:43:58):
If you're trying to learn about a topic in a really robust way, let's say you want to learn about growth, maybe you should take are Reforge course and get access to all of the resources and the insights of the EIRs and the growth advisors that Reforge and get an overview and survey of the landscape instead of one person's experience and the handful of companies that they might have worked with. Likewise, if you're just feeling like you're a little emotionally overcome, I think coaches are this great resource around that, but it's actually better to pay it forward and build a tribe and a community of people around you that you can rely on for support because that's the thing that lasts you for years and years.

(00:44:38):
So one of the first things that I do when people talk to me about coaching is I challenge them and say, "Have you explored all of these other opportunities first, and do you really need a coach? And is a coach actually the best option for you?" Like an anti sell, just so that they know what they're getting themselves into because I don't necessarily think that it's useful for all things, even though it can be helpful.

Lenny (00:44:59):
And then when do you find that it's actually important and valuable and something someone should try to get?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:45:06):
I wouldn't be a coach if I didn't think that it wasn't important and valuable. I think that in certain contexts it can be super helpful. So when you have situations where you're in a state of hyper growth, and you need very accelerated learning, and you need someone who can point you in the right direction, I think coaches can be really helpful. So I work with founders for example, and founders are just in this unique state where everything is chaos. They have no structure. They don't know what their jobs are. They have fully justified imposter syndrome where no one in their right mind would objectively have hired them for the position that they're in. There's really intense highs and lows. So for a founder, it might make a lot of sense to get a coach because they have to learn a lot of stuff really quickly, and time is of the essence.

(00:45:54):
So a coach might be a really helpful shortcut for them to get there. Related to that, I think it's also really helpful on sensitive topics. So there are a lot of things that we want to be coached on where either it takes a lot of time for us to work through and progress because it's a long-term project, for example, or it's something very sensitive. People issues and interpersonal conflicts. Coaches can be especially helpful in those cases because it's this really safe space for you to work through things, but also have someone who's really rational to help guide you through them with potentially some frameworks and extra advice.

Lenny (00:46:30):
So I had a couple coaches in my career and what made me feel like I should pursue that is when you think about a sports athlete or, I don't know, athlete. No one does not have a coach, the best athletes have coaches and they get great because they have somebody helping them get better. It's not just like an accident. They don't just learn on their own. It just makes you realize that other people in their profession that have a coach helping them out are just going to be more successful because innately, they have someone helping them learn how to do the job better. So that made me realize, man, I should probably get a coach to help me out with stuff. Even though there wasn't anything super specific, I'm like, "Oh, I need to fix this problem." It was just like, wow, this just intellectually make sense. So it was actually really important and transformative for me.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:47:21):
If you go to my site, I actually have this guide that I've written over time on both my take on how do you find a coach, and the TLDR there is actually that I strongly recommend to everyone. If you're thinking about getting a coach, talk to two or three different coaches. And really get a sense of their vibe and how well you get to know them. It's surprising because I did this piece of research, which I also wrote about, and we could link to, but I talked to over 80 people about their experiences with a coach. I talked including coaches, including founders, including executives and there's this shocking data point in there where half of people that founder their coach literally went with the first coach that they talked to. It's that your buddy said, "I work with this great coach." And then you go and you hire your buddy's coach.

(00:48:08):
I think that's a totally fine way to go find a coach, but I would actually really just urge people to talk to a couple because what works for your friend may not work for you. And just being able to see some of the variance in terms of the style and how people get along, I think that can make a huge difference in terms of this reflection of how do you learn best? When you think about acquiring a new skill, do you love structure? Do you not like structure? Do you like it when someone really teaches you and walks you through specific examples, or do you frameworks? Coaches come in all of those different flavors. So I think it's really worth it to explore before you get into such a deep relationship with someone, just so that both people can feel really sure about it.

Lenny (00:48:51):
What's one thing that people may not think about or just something that you find really important that maybe is unexpected when you're looking for a coach?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:49:00):
I thought that credentials and the relevant experience of the coach was a huge factor in terms of how you should go about your coach selection. But part of the interviews that I did was talking to founders that had had experiences with coaches and asking them to reflect back, and these founders and executives when they thought about it, they actually said so much more about, it was actually this amorphous sense of vibe with the person, how safe you felt with them, how deeply you would explore with them, and how well they got you, and remembered the pieces of the conversation and help you put it together. Way more than potentially some experiences that they'd had, where this person had the perfect background, but they just never really connected on that level. So it was unintuitive to me that there was such a big piece of it that was around personal connection, which is why I've now pushed people to try to talk to a couple different people.

(00:49:55):
And then the other thing which comes back to the sports coaching analogy is that there are different coaches that are really good at different things. So just like how, if you're a star tennis player, you might actually have multiple coaches working with you, maybe an offensive coach or a defensive coach or working on a particular swing. It actually makes sense when you're really performing at a high level to consider having coaches that work with you on shorter term basis to really just work on your speaking or help you with getting into your groove on writing or help you achieve a specific goal. You shouldn't think about it as this long-term commitment to stay with one person, but instead more choosing off of a menu and thinking about what goal are you trying to achieve right now?

Lenny (00:50:39):
Does anyone ever get multiple executive coaches that... I like how we went from, you don't need a coach to maybe need a month [inaudible 00:50:46] hamstrings.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:50:48):
Yes. I know of multiple people that I've talked to, usually CEOs, that either have had a series of coaches or have multiple coaches. It makes a lot more sense, Lenny, when you think about someone who's getting a pitch coach because they're about to get into fundraising.

Lenny (00:51:04):
Got it. Right. Niche skills.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:05):
Right. For niche things because they're about to enter a process or someone who's trying to get into a writing coach-

Lenny (00:51:11):
Got it. Yeah.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:13):
... in addition to some of their executive and leadership work that they might be doing.

Lenny (00:51:17):
Okay. That makes sense. I love it. I'm going to get four coaches. One for everything I do

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:23):
A podcast coach.

Lenny (00:51:23):
Podcast coach.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:25):
A newsletter coach.

Lenny (00:51:26):
A writing coach, and a-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:30):
Yes. And then a parent coach. Don't forget that.

Lenny (00:51:30):
Parent coach. A job board coach, and then just a life coach. Okay. I'm on it. Okay. So let's touch on the thing that your friends said we shouldn't touch on, which is being a woman in leadership in Silicon Valley. I guess I'll just frame it simply. Imagine there's many young women listening to this podcast, and many may dream of a career like yours, all the things you've shared. What advice do you have for young women just starting out in their career hoping to find a similar path?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:52:03):
This is a really delicate subject, and it's interesting because when I try to decompose why people gave me the feedback they gave me on this topic, I think a big piece of it is just that you want to have respect for the inherent challenges of being a non stereotypically great fit for leadership roles or certain career success roles in Silicon Valley and acknowledge that. And also try to push for some of the agency of the things that you can do. So I'm going to start with just this quick story about someone that I worked with who's given me permission to share this, in a coaching context and then back out. So I was working with a seed stage founder, and she's so smart. She is really dynamic, very, very focused, really, really great at taking feedback and actioning it. She's one of those people that is just stellar, and I have no doubt that she's going to make a huge dent in the universe.

(00:52:58):
We've been working together on Zoom for a couple of months, and I'd built this great respect for her competence as an operator, and the way that she thought and took apart problems and then acted on them. And then we met together for the first time in person at lunch. I feel almost nervous talking about this here. The disparity between my sense of who she was as an operator and how she came across to me initially at this lunch was really striking in that it was a weekday lunch and she was dressed as if she was hanging out on the weekend. So old T-shirt, hair back and in a claw, bra straps were showing. She was just incredibly casual in terms of her physical appearance. It took me almost like a little bit of a step back to reevaluate and think, "Oh, this is the same person, but she actually just presents so differently.

(00:53:54):
So then I took the step after we met and I gave her that feedback in one of our next coaching sessions where we invited each other to give each other feedback. I shared a lot of my impressions with her and I told her, "I respect you so much as an operator. I want to tell you that in the physical meeting that we had together, there was this disparity on how I would've potentially perceived you when I first met you in person versus what I've come to know about you from the months that we spent together."

(00:54:27):
Her reaction was like, "Oh my God, Ada. No one has ever connected the dots for me. Thank you so much. It has never explicitly been told to me that some of these elements which you describe, and they're very easy for me to fix and I'm motivated to fix them, are things that might actually trigger certain impressions or biases. No one's actually said it to me before, and I'm about to go into fundraising. It's actually super helpful for me to hear this, that these are controllable elements of my physical attire or my appearance that might actually just affect the way that people perceive me. And then it gives me this extra hump to get over, in terms of getting to this point of credibility for them to see me as a seasoned operator that I am." She took it so well. But what was interesting about it was actually that she'd made it all this way in her career. She'd even raised funding, and no one had ever given her this feedback.

(00:55:21):
So this is, I think one of the big challenges of being a woman in Silicon Valley because getting to an executive role or getting to a funded founder role, it's like an Olympic level sport. You have to get all the way through the funnel and become one of the few that are really chosen to do that. But the difficulty of this game is that no one tells you the rules of the game. You actually don't really know what are the rules on how to get intros or give intros. What's the right way to follow up? What are the impressions that people have about you? It turns out that in a career context, it's so unsafe for your manager to turn to a young woman on the team and say, "Here, let me give you feedback on your physical appearance, and how it affects your competence and how you're perceived in the workforce." That the vast majority of them will just never do it because there's no winning, which is similar to the feedback that I got.

(00:56:16):
SO where I lean in is to say, we're not powerless and there's something that all of us can do if we're in a position where we feel like not even about being female, it's about being perceived as too young or too old, too tall, too short, not the right race. Whatever reason that you feel people may be disqualifying you or not seeing you. We're not powerless, even though this game is rigged. We can study the game, we can help each other, and we can actually start to call out some of those rules and then find ways around them. In this case, for the founder in this example, she really turned to her friends and did a mini makeover and amped up her appearance.

(00:57:03):
And she came back and she reported, "A lot of people have been giving me really positive feedback, that something about me feels more confident and more energetic, and they can't figure out why." But actually, she was getting a ton of people noticing that something was really different about her in a positive way simply because I was in this great position as her coach to give her some of these pieces of hard feedback that she had never heard before. So it's really on us to try to find those and then try to adapt ourselves to play that game if you want to play at that level.

Lenny (00:57:33):
How nervous were you giving her that feedback?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:57:37):
I was so nervous. I actually almost didn't do it, and then took a deep breath and then decided, what the heck? I think she's great. I think she would really benefit from doing it and I gave it. Even in a position where I'm in a relationship with her where I can have that trust, it was super, super difficult. So I can only imagine how hard it is for people to give feedback like that in another context, but how else are people going to hear it?

Lenny (00:58:03):
I think there was a company culture where they talk about how you're being selfish, not giving someone hard feedback because you don't want to be stressed or risk causing damage to your own reputation. But you're not helping them. So it's a really interesting insight of just like, don't be selfish. Do something that's hard when you think it's going to help someone else.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:58:26):
Right. But I think on the topic of being female or on the topic of physical appearance or maybe even some of the topics around being an immigrant, if you're in a position where you can give that feedback, I think the struggle is often will it be well received? And that's where the feedback comes from me from the curiosity loop for this piece, which was there's almost no winning in doing it because the upside is something great happens for them. But there's just so many downsides to giving advice or giving someone input like that the default course is just to avoid. But then that person never learns the rules of the game.

Lenny (00:59:05):
Yeah, absolutely. It makes me think also a little bit about Radical Candor, basically. I don't know if you read that book, but

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:59:14):
Yeah, Kim Malone Scott, I think.

Lenny (00:59:16):
Yeah. And Sheryl Sandberg had a similar story where she... I think Sheryl Sandberg gave her a really hard feedback and she didn't take it that well, actually. I think you did a better job, or your friend actually took the feedback and did something with it. I think the whole book was just like, "Hey, I actually do this where people actually listen." I think the framework is, you got to communicate that you care deeply about that person, but you want to challenge them directly also at the same time.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:59:40):
Yeah, it's a great story. I think Sheryl Sandberg took her aside after one of her meetings and basically told her that, "If you say um, it makes me sound stupid." And she didn't take that well, but at the same time, later on in retrospect, she reflected that it was so brave and so helpful of someone like Sheryl to go give that feedback because there's a real cost to it. There's real risk to it.

Lenny (01:00:09):
Any other thoughts or advice along these lines that you want to leave people with?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:00:13):
The biggest piece of advice that I have that comes to mind is really around trying to be really thoughtful on something I call eating your vegetables. So I have all these branded terms for things, but-

Lenny (01:00:13):
That's great.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:00:30):
... eating your vegetables is really this idea around how little kids don't really develop an appreciation for vegetables until they're 10 or 12 exposures in. So the researchers say, "Expose kids to vegetables 10 or 12 times, even if they don't like it, because that's what it takes to get someone to like something." So when I think about career strategy and when I think about improving yourself and I think about how do we look for some of the hard feedback, eating your vegetables is this really important component of it because it's about how do you identify dislike for something because you're bad at it or you're new to it or you've never done it before, compared to genuine dislike where you've done it and you really don't like it. So to make it a little bit real, if we think about the world of podcasts, Lenny, I think it's something like 75 or 80% of podcasts never make it past the first podcast.

(01:01:25):
You have to do things a number of times before you really develop an affinity for it. Because the first time you do it, you're just not going to be good. So my mini example of that was early on in my career, I was really awkward and not very good at networking. I moved to Silicon Valley and one of the things that people told me about Silicon Valley was that it's really important to grow your network. It's all about the people. Totally agree about that. However, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't really understand this networking thing. So I gave myself this rule where I had to go out once a week for a couple of months, go to an external event, and I would count out 10 business cards. And the rule was, I had to hand out all 10 of those business cards by introducing myself to people that were new, and touch the back wall of the venue of that event and then I could leave.

(01:02:15):
I did that a couple of weeks in a row, and it was horrible. It was really awful, but it got a lot better. What I realized about that was actually two things. One that, as I started going and I saw familiar faces, it became a lot easier for me to just break in and meet people, just by seeing who people I knew already were talking to. And then second, I got a lot better at just breaking in and introducing myself and understanding how this intro and networking thing worked in terms of meeting people and moving through a crowd. Some of those relationships now from that first job and those first couple months are pretty much foundational to the network and the people that I know today. So it really paid off for me because I really focused on eating my vegetables and powering through that initial discomfort.

(01:03:00):
So to title back when it comes to thinking about how do you progress in your career, think about the obvious things that maybe you're not very good at, and then think about what are some of the actions that you can do to be very deliberate and intentional about practicing it to get to the point where you have some faculty at it because it's just really important in some cases to be good at certain skills.

Lenny (01:03:24):
I really like that. I also really like the physicality of that rule of touching the back wall. It just forces you to go through a room, and I just escape really quickly. Is there any other examples of things you've seen or recommend for doing things like, eating vegetables? That was a really good example of just forcing yourself to go to a networking event, touch the back wall. Is there anything else, any other examples that come to mind that you've recommended or found useful, doing something really hard that was really impactful?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:03:53):
Yeah. So there are actually a few of them. A lot of them around content creation because it's just so hard. So one of them that comes to mind is, I know a lot of people have talked about doing a LinkedIn 30. So 30 days of posting something on LinkedIn in terms of content every day for 30 days straight, and just getting past that barrier of sharing. And then looking at it over time and seeing out of the things that you posted, what really resonated. I also think it's helpful to start thinking about things like getting into DMs. Right. It takes a lot of work to think about, "Oh, this person's really smart, let me DM them. Let me try to strike up a conversation because we're well out of the world of physical business cards. I don't think anyone has those anymore.

Lenny (01:04:34):
No.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:04:35):
But modern networking is finding people that are really interesting on the internet and then finding some way to connect with them. It takes a certain amount of extroversion in that case to start meeting up with people and having conversations with them. So forcing yourself in some way to really think about, "Well, instead of having one outreach and then failing at it and saying, 'I'm never doing that again.' How do I actually create a pattern where I can learn or a sequence of trying to do this 10 or 12 times, and see what I get out of it?" Because that's really how you learn and how you grow.

Lenny (01:05:07):
The LinkedIn 30 idea, I like a lot. Something that I'll share as a tip is when you hear that, I bet a lot of people are just like, "Oh, my God. Going to link post on LinkedIn. So cringey. I don't want to be this self-promotiony LinkedIn person." But what I find is if you reframe it to, "I just want to crystallize a thought that I have and just share something that is useful to me or an insight I've had, and not think of it from, I'm trying to get as many likes. I'm trying to go viral with this post, or I'm trying to just build some following." Just don't think of it that way. Think of it as just want to communicate a thought I have and use this opportunity to crystallize it in a really simple way. That helps motivate. That, at least, works for me. It also ends up being useful for me. It's not like I'm trying to grow some following as a result of that.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:05:59):
I find that really helpful as well. One piece of advice that's similar to that that I've heard is, write for an audience of one. Imagine you're just talking to a friend or you're trying to talk to someone that's a trusted colleague, and just write for them. I think that's really helpful, and it helps us with the problem of getting in over your skis, really over fixating on the outcome of, I did a post and I didn't get my 5,000 followers. And instead, just thinking about I did a post because I wanted to share an interesting idea, and then how cool, some people resonated with it.

Lenny (01:06:31):
Yeah, I love that. You could just even say, something I found useful day one and just approach it that way. That's the stuff that end up being most interesting to people. The less it feels like you're trying to be thirsty for followers and likes and all that stuff. And the more it's just like, here's the thing I've found useful. Enjoy it, if you can.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:06:49):
Yeah. Yeah. People can really tell when you're being genuine and authentic online.

Lenny (01:06:53):
Absolutely. More and more. Maybe a last question. You started a company with your partner. You're both co-founders, you and your husband. I'm curious, what's your take on that approach to starting company? Would you recommend for other folks or not?f

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:07:10):
If you had asked me when I first started the company, it would've been an enthusiastic hell yes. I totally recommend. Now, I have a couple asterisks on top of it, and-

Lenny (01:07:10):
Go on.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:07:23):
... I think it really just goes back to what I was talking about earlier where being a founder is such a traumatic and crazy experience with all these intense highs and lows and lack of structure that when you throw romance into the mix, it's just this really volatile combination. So what I've found is that it seems like it either goes really well or it goes really badly, and there's no in between. And asterisks are there because we've actually had a couple of friends try it, and it's been such a mixed bag of results. So my personal experience is I love it. My partner Sachin, and I work really well together. And the main benefit that we have is that the active founding is such an active obsession that you spend so much of your time thinking about your business and the concepts of your business and whatever problem you happen to be facing.

(01:08:11):
That when I had this thesis of I want to be a founder too, we played it out and said, "Well, okay, now we're going to walk around being obsessed about two completely different things. We may never see each other, and so why not try the same thing?" So our first experiment was actually trying it together, and we were nuts. I actually had a 30, 60 and 90 day plan where we would have check-ins. And some of the explicit questions in the check-in, is this affecting our relationship? Because I just wanted to make sure we were putting our relationship first. It worked well for us to the extent that we've done two companies together. And then when we were at LinkedIn, we actually moved across multiple teams in the company and continued to be counterparts and product and marketing together. So it's been phenomenal. The thing that I would say really helps us in terms of making it a successful relationship was things that I think apply to anyone that's thinking about, should you work with a person and should you be a co-founder with this person?

(01:09:08):
We had a very, very good set of complimentary domains and skillsets, so we had really clear decision making rights. Sachin does product design and engineering. I focus on marketing, operations, finance, everything else on the business side. And because of that, it's really clear that we take input from each other, but ultimately who makes the call and who's driving and owning that project. So that was really helpful for us. And then the big part that I think is the murky Meyer for couples and maybe even for close friends working together is how do you engage in constructive conflict? How do you get to the point where you're attacking the problem and not each other? So if your partner comes to you and says that work was not good, that marketing plan or that product roadmap that you put together, not good, do you take it as the plan is not good and let's talk about what we can actually do to fix it?

(01:10:06):
Or do you take it as, "Oh, gosh, they think I'm not good. They think I'm too lazy. I saw that look that they were giving me." And take it as this personal offense. So the ability to be really truth seeking and take the most respectful interpretation when you're giving feedback to focus on trying to get to a smart good outcome that benefits the business, I think that's actually one of the most crucial things that you have to think about. If you're going to work with anyone. Much less your partner or a close friend on starting a company and what's really worked for us,

Lenny (01:10:37):
I am very impressed with how you're able to execute on this. I don't think I could do this with my wife. That would not go well, I think. You should probably write-

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:10:37):
That's self awareness.

Lenny (01:10:48):
Yeah. No, we're aware. You should write a post on how to successfully build a company with your partner. That seems like you have a lot of really interesting frameworks and insights on how it's worked. The fact that-

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:10:57):
That's a good idea.

Lenny (01:10:58):
... [inaudible 01:10:58] for so long. Yeah, it could be its own little book. Is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:06):
I think you covered most of it, Lenny.

Lenny (01:11:08):
With that then, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:15):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:11:17):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:20):
Persuasion by Robert Cialdini. I think it's a great book, if you're a marketer. It's a great book, if you're a founder or product person. But it really is a breakdown of what are the different strategies to get people to say yes and help persuade them toward things. I think it really helps in terms of thinking through that and designing a product or a business around it.

Lenny (01:11:40):
I've got that in my bookshelf behind me.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:43):
Oh, yeah. It's a great book. Yeah. The next book that I also recommend is a book called Designing Your Life, and it's out of the Stanford Design School. And it's by, let me look, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They're two Stanford D School professors, and what they're doing is they're applying design principles to life design. So how do you actually map that next level career that's both meaningful and fulfilling and also achieves maybe some of the success factors that you really care about, and brainstorm and be really creative about it. So when people are stuck or thinking about career strategy, that's actually one of the books that I always point out for them.

Lenny (01:12:23):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:12:25):
So Ted Lasso is back, so I'm watching that, the newest season. I am also a Star Trek nerd, so I'm watching Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.

Lenny (01:12:25):
I didn't know there's a new Star Trek. That's good to know.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:12:41):
Oh, It's so good. I think the thing I love about Star Trek is just that, unlike some of the classic storylines that you see right now on TV coming out now, sometimes the episodes are just happy. They explore a planet. Nothing bad happens. They see something really wondrous. They all leave happy, and they pat themselves on the back for having explored something. It's something that's missing in the genre of TV that they still have, this happiness factor where sometimes life is good and sometimes life is bad.

Lenny (01:13:09):
I like the sound of that. Although, I've learned about storytelling for a story to be interesting. There needs to be some conflict or problem. So I imagine there's something going wrong somewhere in the middle.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:13:20):
But it's not wrong. It's something interesting happens.

Lenny (01:13:23):
Oh.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:13:23):
And then it's resolved, and it's happy. Right. But it just doesn't always need to be, something tries to kill you.

Lenny (01:13:28):
I got to watch that. That sounds great. I was a huge Star Trek fan back in the day. Didn't know they were still making new ones. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:13:37):
What's a common misconception people have about you? I usually like to throw that in toward the end of the interview, and the reason why I think it's really useful is it's a way for me to reset my bias. I may have had a certain impression about them, and this is their opportunity to speak up and say, "Hey, a lot of people think this about me, but it's not true." It's also this reflection of their self-awareness.

Lenny (01:14:01):
Great. What are some products that you've recently discovered or use regularly, SaaS products or even consumer fun random products that you want to share?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:14:14):
Yeah. I can't go through this podcast without giving a shout-out to Notejoy. So Notejoy is a fast and focused notes app for individuals and teams. So that's the company that I work on. So I use it for everything from Noora product roadmaps to my coaching notes, to even prepping for something like this podcast. I use Notejoy all the time. Another one that I really use a lot is Captio. It's been around for a while, but it's a little iOS app. I don't know if it's on Android, but basically it's a blank notepad. You can dump your brain into it, and there's one button, and it emails it to you. So when I find that I'm really distracted, or I just want to remember something, I use Captio all the time just to quickly capture my ideas. And then I process it later in my inbox.

(01:14:53):
And then something that I just downloaded this week is Arc, the new browser. I'm actually really excited about its vision. I'm not sure if I'm going to work it into my workflow yet or how it fits in, but it's really beautiful and it's really cool to see someone iterating on the cluster that is browser tabs.

Lenny (01:15:11):
Yep. Love Arc. Went deep on Arc in the previous episode and I used Captio, however you call it. And I found another app, actually, the similar thing that I found even more simple. It's called Note to Self, just sits on my doc. Anytime I want to email myself a thought, I open it up and this type of thing. Somehow, it ends up being even easier. So that's another one to check out, Note to Self. Final question. You're really big on productivity. What's one tip that you found that has been really helpful for you in your day-to-day life, being more productive?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:15:43):
Figure out, maybe the night before, the one thing that you want to get done in your day, and then at the earliest opportunity, just try to give yourself five minutes on it. Just five minutes. And the reason why I say five minutes is that there is this challenge that I experience and maybe other people experience as well, which is really just productive procrastination. Even though I know something is really important that needs to get done, I will often do other things that are useful and need to get done simply because I'm avoiding that one thing. And then before you know it's the end of the day and I'm like, "I still have to go do that thing." By really focusing on what's the number one thing and then just getting started on it a little bit. It just makes it really lightweight. And usually, what I find is that five minutes turns into a solid hour just knocking that thing out early in my day, and I feel really accomplished. But it's a mental hurdle that I really struggle with.

Lenny (01:16:37):
I really like the approach of the five minutes because that's such a trick to get you to like, "All right, I'll just do five minutes. I got to get this done."

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:16:44):
Right. It's quick.

Lenny (01:16:44):
I need to bring it. Yeah. There's a book that many people on this podcast have recommended called Make Time, and there's a framework within that called The Highlight, where you pick the highlight of your day, and that's the thing you got to do first and make... That's like, if you do nothing else, do your highlight and-

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:16:59):
Yeah, really similar then.

Lenny (01:17:01):
Yeah, and they don't do the five-minute thing, so I think that's a clever element of it. Ada, this was amazing. This chat was full of feelings, and frogs, and vegetables, and frameworks and insights. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:17:21):
You can find me online. On Twitter and LinkedIn, I'm Ada Chen, A-D-A-C-H-E-N. I have a website, adachen.com, and you can always just shoot me an email, adachen@gmail.com. In terms of how listeners can be useful to me, any feedback and riffs on some of the ideas and topics that we've shared. I'm always eager to learn from other people. So feel free to drop a note and say hello. And if you're a founder and you're interested in learning more about coaching, I'm always happy to talk.

Lenny (01:17:51):
Awesome. And then Notejoy, how do they check that out?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:17:54):
Notejoy.com.

Lenny (01:17:56):

# How to build a high-performing growth team | Adam Fishman (Patreon, Lyft, Imperfect Foods)

## Transcript

Adam Fishman (00:00:00):
Onboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product, right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace. So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other, or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.

Lenny (00:00:55):
Adam Fishman was the first growth and marketing hire at Lyft where he spent two and a half years leading their growth efforts. Then he went on to lead product and growth at Patreon, where he spent over four years building one of the most successful and lasting created platforms out there. And most recently, he was CPO at Imperfect Foods. Today he spends his time advising companies on product and growth, and he's also doing a lot more writing.

Lenny (00:01:19):
And in this episode we cover three things, his growth competency model, which helps you hire and evaluate growth talent and also get a job as a growth person. We go deep into why onboarding is such an underappreciated growth lever and all of the impact that you can have optimizing your onboarding flow. Adam also shares a super cool framework for choosing which company to work at. Adam is hilarious and he's so full of wisdom and I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Adam Fishman.

Lenny (00:01:50):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all-in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing, it's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.

Lenny (00:02:17):
Over the years, I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life with an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda Doc Gallery, including resources from many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, GoCool, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda.

Lenny (00:04:26):
Adam Fishman, welcome to the podcast.

Adam Fishman (00:04:30):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Super excited to be here. It's a pleasure to be on chatting with you today.

Lenny (00:04:36):
It's even more my pleasure. Thank you for being here. To set a little context for listeners that don't know too much about you yet, can you spend 45 seconds giving us a little overview of all of the wonderful things that you've done in your career?

Adam Fishman (00:04:50):
Sure. I'm setting my timer for 45 seconds.

Lenny (00:04:53):
And, start.

Adam Fishman (00:04:55):
So I've been the Chief Product Officer and VP of Growth and Product at a bunch of different companies Imperfect Foods, Patreon, Lyft, the precursor to Lyft which was Zimride to name a few. Now, I do three things primarily, I'm an EIR at Reforge and a program partner, which means I create courses. I run an advisory practice on growth and product strategy, which keeps me pretty busy, and then I recently started a newsletter which was pretty much inspired by your work in this area over the last several years. Those are the three pillars of my life these days, my professional life at least.

Lenny (00:05:31):
Nailed it. Wow, that was very contained and clear. Let's plug the newsletter real quick. What's the URL? Is it fishmanafnewsletter.com?

Adam Fishman (00:05:39):
It is fishmanafnewsletter.com. I am blessed with great initials that allow me to have that name for a newsletter.

Lenny (00:05:47):
It's not obvious. Adam Fishman AF. There you go. That's the acronym. And then in terms of the advising, just to set this expectation, are you looking for more clients or are you capped out? How should people think about that as they listen?

Adam Fishman (00:05:58):
Well, I'm pretty busy, but it is a bit of a revolving door, so there's always some pipeline. So even if I can't work with folks right now, sometimes it makes sense for me to work with them a few months down the road. So always open to new interest and learning about new companies.

Lenny (00:06:12):
All right, great. We'll share how to contact you at the end of this and it will be in the show notes.

Adam Fishman (00:06:15):
Awesome.

Lenny (00:06:17):
One question I wanted to ask off the bat is, Lyft, you were there super early. I imagine it was an incredibly wild ride. I'm curious, what's the most tangible memory you have of your time at Lyft?

Adam Fishman (00:06:29):
I have a ton of memories from the almost three years that I was there, but I think the biggest one, and probably the most tactile or memorable thing was when we launched Lyft, when we were bringing it out of private beta, we had this press event at the office, which is in Soma, and it had these doors, these big huge garage style doors. And so we opened them up and we actually drove a car into the office with a pink mustache on the front of it, and then a bunch of drivers piled out of it and met the press members and were high fiving people and stuff like that. And then we also served a giant pink mustache cake at this event. So of all of the things there, that one sticks in my head the most.

Lenny (00:07:14):
I love that. I hope there was no hair in this mustache cake.

Adam Fishman (00:07:18):
No, no, there was not. It was delicious.

Lenny (00:07:21):
Okay, awesome. Another question I always have for folks that worked at Lyft or at Uber is how they feel about Super Pumped and what it is like watching that, if you've seen it, what it's like watching the story of Uber and especially working for Lyft.

Adam Fishman (00:07:35):
Yeah, I have seen it. I actually read the book first. I've been a pretty big fan of Mike Isaac, who's the New York Times reporter who wrote it. So I've been a big fan of his reporting for a long time. I connected with him a bit while he was writing the book, and I would say, there were parts of it that were painful. It was like renavigating, relitigating a history that I had lived through already. And so much of that story was stuff that I had experienced pretty regularly while I was at Lyft battling against Uber.

Adam Fishman (00:08:04):
So one part of me was like, "I remember that. God, that was hard." Another part of me was happy to see that all of the things were out in the open finally, things that were hard to talk about about competitive practices and stuff like that and just shady things. And some part of me was happy that it was out there. And then one other thing separately, so I actually was interviewing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt to be an advisor with his company HitRecord while he was filming Super Bumped.

Adam Fishman (00:08:35):
And we had this conversation over Zoom when he was on break in between scenes of filming the show. And for those who don't know, he's the guy that plays Travis Kalanick, the CEO and founder of Uber. So he did this interview with me and he was in his trailer on set, fully decked out as TK in his look with his hair slicked back. And it was really funny and also cool to see him in this context. And he is probably the polar opposite from Travis Kalanick. Obviously they're both super successful, but JGL is a really down to earth, nice, very family-oriented calm guy. So anyways, this is a funny story of my time meeting and interviewing with him.

Lenny (00:09:19):
That is amazing. Did you slip in a couple Lyft facts to help Lyft look a little happier and better?

Adam Fishman (00:09:26):
I did. We talked a bit about that journey and I asked him some questions about how he prepared for the role and stuff like that. And so yeah, it was pretty fun. We swapped some stories and stuff. So yeah, it was neat.

Lenny (00:09:37):
Fun fact, my mom wanted me to dress like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I was like, "I should look like this guy. Wear some vests. This guy's looking good. Looks like you a little bit."

Adam Fishman (00:09:48):
I see that. I do see that. That's awesome. Way to go, mom.

Lenny (00:09:51):
Yeah. Then I'll follow her advice. Maybe I should have.

Adam Fishman (00:09:54):
It didn't work out so well.

Lenny (00:09:56):
Yeah. Okay. So transitioning to the meat of our chat, there's three things I wanted to spend our time chatting about. One is your growth competency model, which essentially is this post you wrote recently that tells founders how to hire and how to evaluate growth people. Two, I want to chat about onboarding flows. You have a lot of really interesting experience optimizing onboarding flows and the impact that's had. And then three is how to choose a company to work out. You've chosen a lot of really interesting companies and you have some cool insights around how to think about that. Does that sound good?

Adam Fishman (00:10:27):
Yeah, it sounds great. I've also chosen some bad companies in my time too, so we can talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.

Lenny (00:10:32):
Okay, excited to hear about that. So first we talked about this briefly. You've started to do a lot more writing. You have this newsletter at fishmanafnewsletter.com, and you recently wrote this really epic piece called the Growth Competency Model, which essentially lays out what to look for in a growth leader, how to hire, how to evaluate, what to concentrate skills on? Things like that. First question, just what made you feel like you had to write this? What mistakes have you found founders make when hiring and evaluating growth leaders?

Adam Fishman (00:10:59):
Yeah, so first I'm going to put up my new background here, which is my growth competency model background. For those watching on YouTube, I have a funny graphic in the background for this. So I guess the reason that I wrote this, there were a few reasons that I wrote it. One is it really felt necessary to write it. And at first it's, I don't think I've ever come across this type of canonical reference before around how to hire and plan for growth. So that's number one. I didn't think it existed. It needed to exist.

Adam Fishman (00:11:32):
Two, as an advisor and someone who has held the head of growth role many times, I get asked this question a lot. I get asked all the time about how do you hire growth people? And it's usually something like, "Hey, how do we find you but 10 years earlier in your career?" And it feels like that question is missing the first principles approach to hiring a growth person. And if you're doing that, you're just pattern matching to me. And I may not be the best person, right, or somebody who looks like me may not be the best person. So I think we're missing that.

Adam Fishman (00:12:09):
And then third, one of the programs that I'm currently creating is around growth leadership. And so I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to be an exceptional growth leader, how you hire other people onto your team and create balanced teams. And this is going to be a really important component of that program. So it was just really top of mind. So yeah, that's why I wrote it.

Lenny (00:12:30):
Let me ask one quick question and I think you were about to start answering one mistakes founders make, but I guess it's less of a question. I know this was built on another model for product management, which is really awesome. And I love that there's this growing fountain of career ladders, competencies per function. And so I don't know if there's been one that's really great for design and engineering, but I love that this is happening. And so first of all, I just want to say I appreciate that you put in the time to think this through.

Adam Fishman (00:12:54):
Cool. Thank you. Yeah, and I do think we need more of these. I think we need one for marketers, I think we need one for engineers, designers, research probably, there's probably a bunch of functions that could benefit from some canonicalized resource around this stuff. So yeah, some myths and mistakes that I think founders made and that I've made. I've definitely lived through some mistakes. A few experiences where I was hired into a company where the founder had really messed up expectations of what a growth person should be doing, what I should be doing. And I wanted to set the record straight for founders because they are the folks who hire for this and other leaders.

Adam Fishman (00:13:34):
So one example that comes to mind is, I did a very brief stint at a company called Wyzant, in between Lyft and Patreon. And the founders of that company, so Wyzant was a tutoring marketplace. It was acquired by a company not too long ago, so it's now part of a bigger learning company. And the founders of that company we're looking for what I would call a silver bullet strategy to their growth challenges. And what they really needed, and I was naive and didn't think about asking these questions or about evaluating this properly, what they really needed was to create a strategy to add on new growth loops and a system for how to execute against that strategy.

Adam Fishman (00:14:13):
If we had talked about that as part of evaluating each other, as part of them evaluating me, it would've given me a lot of confidence that it was the right hire to make. But the problem was they didn't approach it that way. They didn't ask me those questions and I was too naive to recognize that, "Hey, they're not actually evaluating this with the competencies that you would expect for a growth leader." Executing a growth strategy takes time and patience, and they didn't really have it. And overall it ended rather unsuccessfully. I helped them build this office in San Francisco, hired a bunch of folks, we actually closed down the office. I had to lay off a bunch of the people that I'd hired, including myself, which wasn't particularly fun. And I think all of it comes back to that they didn't have a really strong set of criteria on what it meant to hire a great growth person. And so if I can help even just a little bit with founders making that decision better, it'll lead to fewer mismatches I think in the hiring process.

Lenny (00:15:11):
Awesome. Let's get into it. What are the components of this model? And you can put it back up again for folks to follow along in the background.

Adam Fishman (00:15:18):
It's coming back.

Lenny (00:15:18):
It's like a TikTok.

Adam Fishman (00:15:19):
The whole thing looks like a big circle and there's four wedges in that circle, four equal parts. And I think that answer of what are the components, what should people look for, really, I'll give the PM answer, which is it depends. And what does it depend on? It depends on the state of the team and where the skill gaps are. So the goal of the competency model is not to find a unicorn human being that is an 11 out of 10 on every one of these things, because frankly, that person doesn't exist. I am not an 11 out of 10 on these skills and I have been a growth executive at many companies. I consider myself to be pretty good at the job. The goal is to create a well-rounded team so that you're hiring and balancing skills across your team and that you don't have any gaps in your portfolio.

Adam Fishman (00:16:06):
And so when you think about it, there are four main components to the growth competency model. And the four big components or buckets are growth execution, customer knowledge, growth strategy, and then the last one is communication and influence. And each of those has three really specific skills. And so to give an example, let's break down growth execution for example, which is one of the very first ones that you should be good at if you're a growth practitioner. Within this competency grouping, there's three individual competencies that are channel fluency, experimentation, and what I'd call productizing learnings. And so you can evaluate and ask questions to understand how good people are at these different things and what their experience has been with them.

Adam Fishman (00:16:54):
So in productizing learnings for example, one of the key things that a growth person has to do is generate hypotheses, learn from those hypotheses and then translate that into changes that they're making in the product. And you want to find somebody who has a track record of at least understanding how to take something they have learned that might be an experiment or something that's very NVP and turn that into something that has hooks into different areas of the product. And so that's a critical skill to evaluate. And one of an example, the overall set of competencies.

Lenny (00:17:26):
To throw in a question real quick, is one way to use this model, coming back to your Wyzant example where there's of course misalignment between you and the founder to sit down and look at this circle here and be like, "Here's where I'm strong, here's where maybe we need to hire someone to take over."

Adam Fishman (00:17:41):
Yeah, absolutely. You can almost use it as a reverse interviewing characteristic and say, "What are the competencies you, founder, CEO, care about? What's really important to you for the first person in this role? Or the expectations that you have of what I will bring to the table." And then you can be really candid about what you're good at and what you're not good at, where you're developing. So yeah, I agree with that for sure.

Lenny (00:18:06):
Awesome. I know this also plays into evaluating your performance and it could be like, "Hey Adam, here's the three things that we want to focus on in the next cycle."

Adam Fishman (00:18:13):
For sure. Yeah. It's really a good foundational framework for being really concrete and specific in the feedback that you provide someone. So rather than saying, "Adam, you really need to be more strategic." Everybody's heard that at some point and it's like, "Well, what do you mean?" You can say, "Hey, we need to work on the area of growth strategy and that means I need to see better modeling of loops out of you, better understanding communication of what those loops are." And you can give really concrete feedback.

Lenny (00:18:44):
Awesome. So we've talked about growth execution, What's next?

Adam Fishman (00:18:47):
The next one is what I would call customer knowledge. And within customer knowledge there's a set of things and really this is about data fluency and instrumentation, understanding user psychology, which is a big one, and then this idea of being able to experiment and learn over time and how you develop your narrative and your creative approach to talking to customers. I love user psychology and it's one of the things that I think attracted me to growth and to product. I studied consumer psychology when I was in college and I'm just probably would've been a psychologist if not for a growth practitioner, which is a weird other approach I could have taken in my career. But-

Lenny (00:19:35):
It's not too late to pivot.

Adam Fishman (00:19:37):
... Second career. Yeah, actually, announcing today I'm pivoting the newsletter to just talk about therapy and psychology.

Lenny (00:19:43):
Yes. This is going to be the title of the podcast.

Adam Fishman (00:19:47):
Awesome. So like user psychology, I think one of the things that people don't easily understand is that most people come to your product with an emotional frame and a lot of people want to appeal to their logical brain right away. And the reality is, don't do that. And so you have to understand the mindset that people are in. How low are their lows? How high are their highs? Why are they seeking out your product? And it often, as I mentioned, stems from some emotional challenge that they're having or something that they're seeking. And it's not because your product is the best chat bot or because it gives the best answers. There's a different thing that they're trying to solve. And only when you address that can you move on to those other things. So that's the second competency is, customer knowledge.

Lenny (00:20:34):
It reminds me of something I mentioned on some podcast recently, this tweet that one of the Collison brothers tweeted about how user research is often misunderstood in that people think you do user research and that informs what you build. And instead the way you think about it is user research informs your model of your customer and that model informs what you build.

Adam Fishman (00:20:56):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:20:56):
And the more user research you do, the more your model evolves to help you understand the customer. And that's been really helpful for me because I never thought of it that way.

Adam Fishman (00:21:04):
Yeah. I think that's a great example. Seeking the solution in a customer interview is never going to work, right? You seek to understand and then you take that away and you can think through what the model should look like and how things should change as a result. Yeah. That's great. I can cover the third and fourth competency-

Lenny (00:21:24):
That's good.

Adam Fishman (00:21:25):
... and I'll try to be a little more brief on that.

Lenny (00:21:27):
No, no. It's good.

Adam Fishman (00:21:28):
The third competency is growth strategy. And now the third and fourth competencies I would say are a bit more advanced topics. And again, remember when I said people index higher or lower on these as they go across their career, I would expect a more junior growth person to not necessarily be a 10 out of 10 on strategy and communication. These are things that you really have to work at a long time. They tend to be softer skills in a lot of cases and you learn best by either getting it very right or getting it very wrong. And so you've got to put in the time to develop these. But in growth strategy, there's three. The first one is growth loop modeling. So really understanding how you grow and where you should be spending your time. What acquires users? What retains them? What monetizes them?

Adam Fishman (00:22:18):
The second one is capital allocation and forecasting. This is basically where are you deploying either your money, your people, how are you managing the portfolio and how are you projecting that out into the future? And that's a really hard one. You have to become best buddies with your finance friends in order to do that. And so anyways, that's capital allocation and forecasting. And then the third one is prioritization and road mapping. So you have to be able to sequence the work much like in building a product, right? Building your growth strategy, you have to sequence it. That sequence has to make sense based on your growth models. You have to have the capital or the people to allocate to that stuff. And you have to be able to build a series of hypotheses in a series of solutions to test against those hypotheses so that you can learn and then productize to those learnings.

Adam Fishman (00:23:09):
And there's a lot of ways to test this stuff. Situational, behavioral, interviewing, I talk a lot about this in my post on hiring growth. There's like very specific questions you can ask to understand what people have done or what they might do in different situations. There's case studies and things like that. So that's the third one. And then the fourth one is communication and influence.

Adam Fishman (00:23:29):
And I would say, I think you probably know this as a PM, influence is one of the biggest and hardest skills to develop. It's no different in a growth practitioner and in some cases it can even be harder because sometimes people come in with a preconceived notion of what growth is and isn't and you have to change their mind. And so within communication and influence, there's strategic communication. So how do a series of experiments and a series of things that you're trying, fit into the overall picture of a bigger bet that you're taking?

Adam Fishman (00:24:06):
How do you lead a team? So team leadership is a big part of communication and influence. And then how do you manage stakeholders? And this is hard in growth because often growth can be viewed as at odds with really thoughtful and quality craftsmanship and product building, but it's not. Those things go hand in hand. And so you really have to win people over on what it means to do growth. And I would say, this is the pinnacle, right? This is the hardest one. It's a lifelong journey. It relies very extensively on understanding people and who you're talking to. And those people can be very different from company to company and the currency that they trade in can be really different. And so this one is one where you have to go back to square one and relearn who the people are that you're working with every time you step into a new role or a new company or get a new leader or something like that. So it can be really challenging and it's never done.

Lenny (00:25:03):
That component of the competency models, we're the PM of the growth PM role feels like if you were to do these Venn diagram of the two roles, feels like that's a big part of the overlap.

Adam Fishman (00:25:13):
Yep, absolutely. There's a lot of overlap between exceptional product managers and exceptional growth practitioners. I think sometimes they just use the skills in different ways. So you need to be great at product strategy to be a product leader, you need to be great at growth strategy to be a growth leader. Just what those things look like can be different between the two. But they're both required skills, required competencies to be exceptional at the role.

Lenny (00:25:38):
So just to rehash, the four categories are communication influence, growth execution, customer knowledge and growth strategy. You mentioned earlier that people often come to you and they're like, "How do we find another Adam?" And your feedback is one, how do you know that's exactly what you need? And then two, find someone that's up and coming more because it's so hard to find folks like you that are actually ready to take on a head of growth role.

Adam Fishman (00:26:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:26:03):
So a question for you is, one is, do you recommend founders focus on finding someone that's more up and coming and fast learning with a high trajectory? And if so, which of these components would you suggest they look for most?

Adam Fishman (00:26:19):
One of the challenges of hiring a senior person is that they're all off writing newsletters and making podcast.

Lenny (00:26:25):
Right.

Adam Fishman (00:26:25):
Not that we know anybody who does that or anything, but-

Lenny (00:26:28):
No. That's bullshit. What is that?

Adam Fishman (00:26:29):
Yeah. So I don't want to right now go back and work at a company again. I'm enjoying what I'm doing and so it's hard to get me, right? But also you don't want me, I think, when you're doing this for the first time. So I think the key there is smart and driven people for sure. Age and youth is a bit relative I'd say. So I would think about hiring somebody who you might say is less experienced in growth, but they could be very senior in another aspect of their career. You can also benefit from hiring somebody internally who wants to branch out into growth. And one of the benefits that you get from that is a lot of time they have one of those competencies really nailed already. Could be like customer knowledge. They might understand your customer base super well because they're already inside the company.

Adam Fishman (00:27:15):
So if you're going to hire a junior person, the key is, how do you help them learn? And I think if you don't know what you're doing as the founder or the leader, it's hard. You're not going to be able to help them yourself. So you've got to be willing to invest in advisors like me, outside education, mentorship, coaching, otherwise, what's going to happen is that very driven, hungry and enthusiastic person is going to run through a lot of brick walls, which is great, except they're going to miss the fact that the door was standing right next to the wall that they just ran through and you're going to end up with a lot of bricks on the ground.

Lenny (00:27:54):
Excellent metaphor.

Adam Fishman (00:27:56):
Yeah, thank you. And so I have some examples of both hiring people and moving people over in my career. So I think tangible examples are really helpful here. So when I was at Lyft, I had the privilege of hiring that young, smart and driven person a bunch of times, but one of the people who comes to mind is a guy named Ben Lauzier. You should have him on the podcast at some point. He's French, he's very nice to listen to you. He was most recently a VP of product at Thumbtack, but he was definitely not that when I hired him, he was a jack of all trades marketer working at a corporate catering startup when I hired him at Lyft. And he had nailed most of the growth execution and the customer knowledge competencies.

Adam Fishman (00:28:38):
One was, he was an avid Lyft user himself, so he really understood the product really well. And also, he was just very thoughtful about how he executed, how he experimented. He had done a lot of it and he was very skilled at pulling them off in a very small environment because he had just had to be. And those are the two most important competencies when you're bringing in a younger, earlier stage person because teaching somebody how to execute is not that fun, right? That's a hard skill. The ability to execute is something like executive function skills and things like that. If you haven't developed those by the time you are an adult, I don't know that I'm going to be able to teach you and I'm certainly probably not the right person to teach you. You should definitely get some outside assistance with that. And so I like to get those types of people that have those things if I'm hiring that generally inexperienced growth practitioner.

Lenny (00:29:42):
And the two things you said are customer knowledge and execution. Is that the two you said?

Adam Fishman (00:29:46):
Yes. Customer knowledge and growth execution. And so let me tell you an execution story about Ben really quick. This comes also down to work ethic too. So we interviewed Ben and it was a long day of interviews in a tiny glass conference room and Lyft was, I don't know, 30 people or something at the time. At one of the interview breaks, Ben had come over and he didn't have his computer and anything like that. And so he was ducking out of work to do the interview. And he actually came out of the office and he's like, "Hey, does anybody have a computer that I can borrow?" And so we gave him this old crappy Chromebook and I was like, "Why do you need a computer?" And he's like, "I have to go edit this file and do this thing and check something in at work and deploy this thing or whatever."

Adam Fishman (00:30:32):
And I'm like, "Wow, this is a guy that really knows how to get stuff done and is so much so that he's pausing his interview process so that he could go get a thing done for his company that he's actively trying to leave, but he's got this work ethic and this execution." And that really stuck with me. And he probably would remember this story if we brought it up. So the time he borrowed a crappy Chromebook laptop to do work at the job that he was trying to leave.

Lenny (00:31:00):
What are the chances that was staged?

Adam Fishman (00:31:01):
He seemed very innocent. So I think not staged.

Lenny (00:31:06):
Okay, great.

Adam Fishman (00:31:06):
But I could be wrong. But now everyone that interviews that is going to ask to borrow a laptop and-

Lenny (00:31:10):
That's right.

Adam Fishman (00:31:10):
... check in some work.

Lenny (00:31:11):
The phone call.

Adam Fishman (00:31:13):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:13):
"Adam, I need to fix something."

Adam Fishman (00:31:15):
That's right. So that's Ben. And then on the other side, and I'll cover this one really quickly, and the other side of moving somebody over internally, I had equally great success with that. So there was another person named Sean at Patreon who was a marketer, again, a jack of all trades marketer. And I think I have a propensity and a bias towards folks like that because that's one of the ways that I started my career was in marketing. But anyways, I moved him over from marketing to being a growth PM, an entry level growth PM.

Adam Fishman (00:31:47):
And he had a ton of the execution skills, ability to prioritize really well and customer knowledge skills as well, more so on the customer side because he was an internal transfer, so he really knew our customers. He'd spent tons of time talking to people, studying data and things like that. And he had really great fluency with data and a drive to continue improving his ability to access and pull out insights and information. And so he turned out to be really great, but just a very different profile of a person than Ben was. And here's an internal hire versus an external hire.

Adam Fishman (00:32:23):
So you can have success with both, but I think you really have to make sure that there's some foundational things that are in place like that ability to get customer knowledge and execute.

Lenny (00:32:34):
If a founder is listening and trying to decide or hiring a head of growth or a new growth person, would you push them one way or the other, internal hire versus finding someone up and coming and smart?

Adam Fishman (00:32:44):
I tend to skew more towards internal hire to be perfectly honest, because I believe in creating opportunity inside a company. I think it's not done often enough. And I also believe that helping people transition into new roles is a way to get more people into the practice. And one of the ways that can happen is if you take a chance on somebody who has demonstrated a good track record in some other aspect of your business. So I tend to recommend internal. I think you have faster time to results. I think you know what you're getting better and in much less likelihood of making the wrong hire there. So I bias towards internal hires.

Lenny (00:33:25):
Awesome. And I think partly, I feel that too because there's so much content and training for growth these days that somebody has that background in your company and is already motivated and excited and then can just learn, go to Reforge course, read certain newsletters, feels like it's a lot easier to ramp up. Except, I always feel like if you need someone for SEO or paid growth, that's a hard thing to learn. What's your take there?

Adam Fishman (00:33:51):
I would bucket that type of person into a specialist. And one of the archetypes that I talk about is this idea of the painter versus the architect versus the surgeon. And the surgeon is your precision person. I don't actually recommend hiring that as your first hire, but when you are onto something and you really need expertise and you don't have that expertise internally, yes, I think hiring externally is the right thing to do at that point because those are really specific skills that some people have taken years to learn. And I can't just teach someone SEO over the course of a weekend and expect that they're really going to get it. In those cases, I think hiring that specialist or that surgeon is the right approach, once you've got some of the foundational stuff in place.

Lenny (00:34:41):
Awesome. Great. Yeah, it feels like there's still a lot of dark art in those two specialties that take years of experience.

Lenny (00:34:49):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on Apple to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.

Lenny (00:35:26):
Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead, you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, gete-p-p-o.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:35:59):
This is a good time to segue to our second topic, which is onboarding. I know you're a big proponent of spending time on onboarding, optimizing onboarding. How have you found onboarding to be as a lever for growth and just what gets you excited about investing in onboarding?

Adam Fishman (00:36:13):
I love onboarding. I probably do at least an onboarding project to at least one with every company that I've worked for and a lot that I advise. The first thing I would say is, onboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace.

Adam Fishman (00:36:53):
So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.

Adam Fishman (00:37:17):
And the third thing I would say is it's also probably the most motivated that someone is going to be about your product since they're typically starting their onboarding journey with you at a time where they're like, "I need this thing really badly that you're selling." And so they're really motivated, right? And so it's an opportunity for you to put some friction in place and learn a lot about them because they will knock down doors to get to your product. So that's why I think it's a super powerful lever for growth. And we worked on this extensively at Lyft, at Patreon, Wyzant, Imperfect Foods just released some onboarding improvements that we had created when I was there, which was nice to see that finally come to light. So yeah, I've done this pretty much everywhere at some point.

Lenny (00:38:07):
What impact have you seen from working on onboarding to give people a sense of like, "Wow, this is what I can get if I put some time here."

Adam Fishman (00:38:15):
Yeah. One of the things that onboarding really drives is habit formation with the product, which leads to retention. And so you should expect to improve your overall cohort retention curves by focusing on the onboarding and activation experience. I have seen companies shift their curve outward by 10, 15, 20 percentage points from making those changes, especially when you consider that churn is most likely to happen in the very earliest usage of the product. If you can get people past that hump, it's a really invaluable part of the product to work on.

Adam Fishman (00:38:51):
So I'll give you a really concrete example. At Patreon, one of the places we worked on onboarding really extensively and the onboarding experience was one of the teams that we had on growth at Patreon. We did a lot of experimentation around the earliest, what we would call product led sales now, when do you connect a human being with a creator and the onboarding experience and what is that impact and how do you connect them with the right person or with the right creator when there are tens of thousands going through that onboarding journey every week?

Adam Fishman (00:39:25):
What we realized through a lot of experimentation was the idea of connecting someone with a human being the right person at the right time would improve the first month of revenue or the second month of revenue that a creator made on the platform by 25%. Why that mattered is because the second month that you processed payments on the platform was a key input into your LTV on the platform. So by improving a creator's first and second month revenue by 25%, we were then able to improve their overall value on Patreon by an equivalent amount, which is pretty massive. Moving anything by 25% is really impressive.

Adam Fishman (00:40:09):
And so that was human intervention, and then we actually started to productize the stuff that the humans were doing. And so what is not scalable when you're using people becomes very scalable if you can replicate components of that with technology. And so that was the next phase, so we get back to that growth execution thing that I talked about and productizing learnings. That is an example of how you go from, we've learned some things by humans that have made a 25% impact to now we're building these into the product. And so that's a really good example I think, of Patreon and one of the impacts that we had on creator, earnings, retention and their overall success on the platform.

Lenny (00:40:50):
That's an amazing example, in case it's useful to a person working on the onboarding. Can you share any more about what you actually did there? You create some algorithm of this type of person, we'll connect them to a person and then you productize it. Is there anything more you could share there that might be useful to folks?

Adam Fishman (00:41:06):
Gosh, we did so much. So I'll try to pull out a couple of example. So one of the things that we did, and again, I spoke to the fact that people are really motivated in your onboarding experience, one of the first things we did was we tried to identify better who a creator was in the onboarding experience. And who they were meant how big is their audience on a bunch of the channels where they managed communities, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, YouTube, et cetera. And then how engaged was that audience? It's one thing if you make crazy cat videos on YouTube and you have a million subscribers, it's another thing if every time you publish a video, all million of those people watch it, comment on it, share it, et cetera.

Adam Fishman (00:41:49):
And so we would ask creators to connect various accounts to Patreon, maybe through authoring with YouTube or Spotify or Instagram or Facebook or something like that, Twitter, and then we would pull in the data into our backend and identify people who had large followings and also heavily engaged followings, based on a set of criteria per channel. And again, this was not just like me inventing this. We had a data scientist team that we worked very closely with to figure out what was important and what wasn't in this model. And then if you were one of those people that had a high propensity for success, high potential creators, we would siphon them off from the regular self-guided onboarding and basically land them in the lap of a human being who could engage with them, reach out, get them even more excited and start talking to them about the best things to do.

Adam Fishman (00:42:46):
And then the productization of that, the best things to do turned out to be things like one of our product principles, which became opinionated defaults, which is basically making it hard to do the wrong thing when you're setting up your Patreon page and easy to do the right thing but not eliminating choice.

Adam Fishman (00:43:07):
So the creator could still make the choice to do the wrong thing. They could still set up a single tier when we knew that a three-tiered pricing model actually would work better for them, or they could choose to set up 40 tiers when we knew that the sweet spot was three to five or perhaps make their lowest price tier a dollar instead of what we recommended, which was like three or $5 entry points. So they could do all that stuff, but we made it difficult for them to do it. We put more friction in place when they were trying to change some of those defaults because we had learned across a universe of creators, hundreds of thousands of people what worked best.

Adam Fishman (00:43:52):
And so putting in those guardrails and those default things was a huge lever for us to drive the behavior that we wanted. And again, we learned that from human intervention with the right types of creators, then detecting those people and putting in the guardrails in the product themselves and making those recommendations inside the product experience. And they were pricing tier structure, how you actually write your page, all of that stuff.

Lenny (00:44:18):
Such a great example. It reminds me we had exactly the same situation at Airbnb that you just made me think about. We called it smart defaults. What was your term? Opinionated defaults?

Adam Fishman (00:44:29):
Opinionated defaults. Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:30):
Yeah, I like that. So at Airbnb we had a bunch of calendar settings when a host signs up, on the host side is where I spent a lot of my time, we had instant book, which is basically you sign up as a host and people can book you instantly. That became the default for Airbnb. And so to make that successful, hosts had to have their calendar be accurate from the beginning. And so what we got to eventually, is we tried to figure out, are you a professional host that knows what you're doing? Are you a mom and pop that's just trying this out? And then based on that, either block your entire calendar, keep it all open, or somewhere in between.

Lenny (00:45:03):
And it's interesting that it connects to your point about, and I was going to come back to this that, a lot of people think of onboarding as a conversion opportunity and it definitely is. But to your point, even more interestingly, it's a retention opportunity because in the Airbnb case, hosts sign up, they get booked for a day, they don't want to host, they're like, "Shit, what the hell's going on here? I'm out."

Adam Fishman (00:45:22):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:45:22):
And so, I wanted to ask you, how should folks think about onboarding conversion versus retention, and why is it so powerful for retention?

Adam Fishman (00:45:32):
I actually think if you're doing it right, sometimes conversion should actually decrease a little bit. So you might actually have fewer people getting all the way through successfully, but I think that's okay because a lot of those people were probably not the right people for your product, which means they wouldn't have been engaged customers, they probably would have churned. So just by the nature of actually weeding out some people, you're going to improve retention because the people who are going through are the people who are much more highly qualified. And so I think that's also why onboarding is so challenging because you have to figure out what that sweet spot is, right?

Adam Fishman (00:46:17):
You could actually reduce conversion to a point where it's not offset by improvements in retention and you'd be doing the wrong thing. So when you're experimenting, you have to look at these push and pull metrics of these opposing metrics. But overall, I find that the biggest impact that you'll have is on retaining users because you are trying to connect them to the value that your product offers and form a habit. And if you form that habit early on, they're going to stick around because they're going to get it, they're going to get the benefit of the product, and they're going to be excited to stay and then tell more people about it. So that's why I think it's a much bigger impact on retention than conversion.

Lenny (00:47:01):
Obviously retention is a longer tail metric and conversion is immediate.

Adam Fishman (00:47:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:47:07):
Do you have any tips for folks that are like, "Oh my God, how do I know if this conversion hit is worth retention increasing potentially?"

Adam Fishman (00:47:13):
Yeah. I think the answer is not wait 90 days to find out, right? Nobody has that time. And so what I tend to do is look at proxy metrics. So there are proxies for things like 90 day retention. As an example at Patreon, one of our proxies around the eventual success of a creator was how quickly they would reach certain dollar thresholds once they launched. And so your velocity to get to your first patron, your first a hundred dollars processed on the platform and that thing had a lot to do with how big and successful you would be, and therefore how well you would retain.

Adam Fishman (00:47:52):
And so we looked at very early signals to understand and evaluate how good someone was going to be. We also did a lot of qualitative screening in the beginning. So as people went through, we would take samplings of creators who were onboarding and signing up and launching their pages, and we would actually look at who the creator was and what they were doing. And then we would be able to run it through our model to say, "It looks like we're getting a lot of the right people going through and doing the right behaviors, therefore, we're very confident that they're going to retain better and do the right things." So yeah, proxy metrics are the key there.

Lenny (00:48:32):
Awesome. So part of this is find this leading indicator proxy metric, and then to your point, maybe build a little bit of a heuristic that's like, okay, this is qualitatively looking like it's doing the right things to our new users.

Adam Fishman (00:48:45):
Yep.

Lenny (00:48:46):
Maybe our last question on onboarding is, at Airbnb and I imagine many companies, there's this constant desire to, "Let's just redo this whole thing. Let's just redesign it. Let's start again." And my question to you is just, how much is too much on redoing, rethinking, onboarding, optimizing, micro-optimizing? Any answers there?

Adam Fishman (00:49:05):
Yeah. I would say first, I very strongly dislike the idea of redesigning something for redesigning sake. So I think that it is true that you should spend a lot of time on onboarding, and you should regularly revisit it as you learn new things about your users. So even at Patreon, we would work on onboarding and then we take a beat, we'd let it go for a while, improved, and then as we learn new things, we would find ways to fold those back into onboarding. So I find that it's acceptable to revisit when you are learning net new principles about your customers or something new about your growth model where onboarding can directly influence.

Adam Fishman (00:49:51):
So as we learned at Patreon what the right tier construction was, or the right way to talk about your Patreon page or the right way to message it in the beginning, we would go back and say, "How do we build this newfound knowledge into an experience that sets someone up for success?" But if we weren't gaining new insights, we weren't just tweaking the onboarding experience and trying to tune it in a very micro way, because the reality is, that doesn't really move the needle that often, especially once you've got it in a pretty good foundational place. And only when you discover something really fundamentally net new, will it have an outsized impact on retention or the success of early users. So don't just redesign for redesign sake, make sure there's a new hard earned insight that you've got before you do it.

Lenny (00:50:50):
Do you think at scale companies, I don't know, maybe after hundreds of people, they should have a team, like an onboarding optimization team? I find that often is true. And I guess, do you think that makes sense?

Adam Fishman (00:51:03):
Yeah. I think it's very helpful. And the reason I think it's helpful is because I do think it's easy to walk away from onboarding because there's so many other things to work on and to lose sight of the fact this is such a critical part of the experience. And I don't know how many times I've come into a company and they're like, "Yeah, we built that a long time ago and we've never looked at it again. It's been a few years, but we're really having a real problem with retention and people dropping off in the first seven days." And I'm like, "Yeah, I think it's time we take another look at the onboarding experience. Products change quite a bit. Maybe people are getting something that's different than they expect, or maybe we know a lot more that we can use to influence decisions that they make."

Adam Fishman (00:51:50):
So I do think it is beneficial to have that team, or at least a team, that part of their job is the activation experience and therefore some part of their roadmap is working on onboarding and then other aspects of activation. So it may not be what they work on 12 months out of the year, but maybe for a quarter or two in a given year.

Lenny (00:52:13):
Cool. And there's a LinkedIn post you wrote with a bunch of examples of onboarding work you've done. So we're going to include them in the show notes for folks that are-

Adam Fishman (00:52:20):
Nice.

Lenny (00:52:20):
... hoping for more examples. Yeah. Okay. Third topic, final topic is around company selection and evaluating where to work. And you have this really cool framework that I think you call PMF for candidates. Can you talk about what that is and then we'll get into it a little bit?

Adam Fishman (00:52:34):
Yeah. I somehow stumbled on that name and it just made sense because of the acronym. But I think I was really motivated to revisit this because as we know in tech there's been a ton of layoffs and very public layoffs because of the economy, the state of funding, things like that. And I don't think we're done yet. I think we're pretty far from being done. But it's really important, and I've been burned by this a few times, to put some power back in the hands of the people who are actually seeking the jobs to understand what are some criteria that are important and these are the criteria that are important to me that help you make decisions about which company I should join, assuming they'll have me. And so the PMF acronym, and we're all familiar with product-market fit, right?

Adam Fishman (00:53:23):
So in a way it's both the product-market fit for as a candidate with the company, but then also PMF stands for people, mission and financials. And these are my three criteria. They may not be yours, Lenny, or they might not be the average person on the street, but the point is that you should have a set of criteria that you are unapologetically rigorous around and you should learn how to evaluate companies against that set of criteria. First, I guess I'll tell you what by people, mission and financials.

Adam Fishman (00:53:56):
So people are these folks that I am going to enjoy working with everyday that I'm going to be able to have hard conversations with, that I'm going to be able to disagree with and work through those disagreements and feel better on the other side of that productive disagreement, for example, and get to resolutions. What do I think about my peer set, the leaders, the people below me, if that's the role I'm stepping into, et cetera. So that's the people dimension.

Adam Fishman (00:54:30):
Mission, which is critically important for me, is that if I join a company and I do my job, which often involves growing that company really big, getting a lot of customers, generating a lot of demand and retention and stuff, I want to make sure that a lot of people have a better outcome in life because of that company's existence. And I don't just mean employees and founders having a good financial outcome, which I think is important. But I also mean in the case of creators on Patreon, we were building a new way for creators to make money, which they could then use to hire people, create more jobs, make better content, and live their life in a sustainable way so that they weren't a starving artist and they weren't living paycheck to paycheck. So that's really important, the mission aspect, that's got to exist.

Adam Fishman (00:55:19):
And then the third one is, and I think really important now is this idea of financials or fiscal discipline. You've got a lot of companies who raised boatloads of money or did financial planning during the peak of the pandemic and assumed that their business was going to continue operating at the pace that it was operating forever. A lot of those companies are running out of money, they've seen a hit to demand and they've had to lay people off as a result or make really big strategic swings.

Adam Fishman (00:55:53):
There are plenty of companies that you're not really hearing about that were more conservative in their approach, that understood and were able to look into the future and be really responsible with their money. And those people are not laying off employees. And so they're not all over LinkedIn talking about it because they're not laying people off. There's no hashtag layoff for them. So that's what by financials. And so that's the PMF framework and evaluating across those dimensions is super important. I've done it two times in the last 10 to 15 years, and I've done it poorly, two times in the last 15 years. And Lyft and Patreon are two times where I've done it really well. Wyzant and Imperfect Foods are two times where I personally don't think I've done a good enough job evaluating.

Adam Fishman (00:56:41):
Any time where I've shortcutted my criteria, where I've settled for two out of three, or thought one was great, when really it wasn't, has not ended well for me, for the company, it's not that the company imploded, but I found myself out of a job or really frustrated and burned out or something like that. I already talked about the Wyzant example where we had to lay off a bunch of people because the founders expected something very different than what I expected to be able to deliver, that's a big people miss. And Imperfect Foods was somewhat similar, amazing mission, really great financial strategy, fantastic CFO, but a lot of infighting at the C-suite. And it made it really difficult for us to plan and move the company forward together because people were at odds with each other all the time and not resolving disagreements productively. And when that happens, it's hard to be a product or a growth leader because you bear the brunt of the angst that people have. So anyway, so those are a couple examples and some of the characteristics of PMF.

Lenny (00:57:57):
In the case of Imperfect Foods, what could you have done to have avoided that issue and seen if it was true PMF?

Adam Fishman (00:58:04):
I would have tried to observe the inner workings of the C-Suite a little bit more closely before I accepted an offer to join the company. I would've attended an executive meeting or joined them on an offsite. And I think, too often, candidates don't feel like they can ask for those things. And it's true, if you're entering the C-suite, you're going to ask for more stuff, you're more experienced. But I also think that's true of a junior employee. You can observe a team meeting, you can observe a product review and understand, you sign an NDA, you promise you won't tell anybody about it, but observe what is happening and the dynamics of that room. Who's doing the talking? How feedback is delivered, is it constructive? Is it antagonistic, et cetera. So you can observe and then you can also ask questions.

Adam Fishman (00:59:00):
So questions that I like to ask are, tell me about the last strategic offsite that you had as a leadership team. Where do people disagree? What was one thing that they disagreed on and where did you end up on that point and how did you get there? And I actually ask them to tell me, it's like a reverse behavioral interview question. I ask them to tell me how they navigated it, and I will ask the CEO that and really dig in on that particular set of questions. Those are the things that I do to evaluate the people dimension, which is one of the hardest, I will say. Financials and mission a little easier to evaluate, but people really require getting to know teams. So it is hard.

Lenny (00:59:43):
That's such a good question to ask. And your point is you can ask that even if you're not a senior leader, you're just ICPM joining a team. Is there anything else you think folks can do? So you said, join some offsites maybe, ask this question that you shared, any other tips for folks just to understand if the people are a good fit? Because it's pretty wild. You're going to spend so much time with these people and you meet them once in a half hour interview and then you have to decide if that's your life for the next four or five, 10 years.

Adam Fishman (01:00:09):
Well, one thing that I would say is, you're an investor, right? You invest in a lot of companies, you're an angel investor and you have the Airbnb syndicate and things like that. You evaluate companies when you're making an investment decision, right? Because you're investing a sum of money into that company. And so as a result, you do a lot of diligence on companies or read other people's diligence, something like that. When you're interviewing at a company, you are actually investing an even more scarce resource. You're investing your time. There is no way to get more time. We're all on a finite clock. You can always get more money. If you make a bad investment decision, "Okay, we lost there." Provided you didn't bankrupt yourself. Even if you did, you can climb out of bankruptcy. There are things that you can do, but time is fleeting.

Adam Fishman (01:00:56):
And so one of the other things, and this is a thing that you do when you're an investor, is you do back channel references, right? A company is going to back channel, you the employee, if they're a good company, they're going to talk, if you and I had worked together, Lenny, they might say, "Hey, let me get in touch with Lenny and see what it was really like working with Adam instead of what Adam tells me in the interview process." And you're going to do this as an investor in a company. "Let me talk to some people who passed on investing in this company. What did they see that I don't see?"

Adam Fishman (01:01:29):
And so in this case, you can talk to current or former employees who are not on the interview circuit. And because they are not on the interview circuit, their role as a salesperson in the process is greatly diminished. And they can, especially if they're not at the company anymore, give you some pretty candid feedback on what it's like to work there. So I'll give you a really good example. That was super impressive. A PM who worked for me at Patreon, who you know Tal Raviv-

Lenny (01:02:00):
Shout out Tal.

Adam Fishman (01:02:01):
Shout out to Tal, who works on this product that we're recording on right now-

Lenny (01:02:06):
Shout out Riverside.

Adam Fishman (01:02:08):
... when he interviewed at Patreon, he asked me for a list of people who I had managed in the past, and he contacted them to talk to them about what it was like to work for me. That was the first time that had actually ever happened in my career. And I was happy to share that with him. And it represented to me a great level of thoughtfulness and insight around him evaluating what he was getting himself into. And he was an ICPM and he asked that of me, who was a VP executive level person at the company.

Adam Fishman (01:02:44):
So you can do that. And if a company says no or a person says no, I think that actually says a bit more about them than anything else. If they're trying to withhold that from you. Because why would you? If I'm a great manager, I'm happy to have you talk to people who I've managed before, even people maybe who I had to let go or something like that, right? I'm confident that those were the right decisions and that those people ended up in a better place and they were taken care of with great care. I would actually make a reference of somebody who I have let go before just so that someone could get a real honest truth of what it was like working with me. So anyways, that's my take on PMF and questions to ask.

Lenny (01:03:30):
I imagine you have PMF with your current world, so maybe just to close, can you just remind folks what you're up to now and where they can find you online and also how listeners can be useful to you?

Adam Fishman (01:03:42):
First, thanks for having me on, Lenny. This was super fun. I love talking about this stuff and it was great chatting with you. So thanks again for having me.

Lenny (01:03:50):
My pleasure.

Adam Fishman (01:03:51):
There are a few ways to get in touch with me. You can follow me and communicate with me on Twitter. My Twitter handle is Fishman, F-I-S-H-M-A-N AF. And I do respond to messages provided that they're polite. And you can also find me on LinkedIn. Those are the two platforms I live on most frequently, for better or for worse. And then I now have this newsletter, fishmanafnewsletter.com. And a lot of what we talked about today are things that I am publishing in written form on that newsletter and plan to continue publishing going forward. And again, it was inspired by the work that you're doing, Lenny.

Adam Fishman (01:04:29):
So how can people be helpful to me? I think certainly subscribing to the newsletter and joining that community, telling me about the things that are challenging to them so that I can find ways of finding how they meet up with my interests and translating them into written pieces. And then if you're ever interested in exploring an advisory relationship with me or learning more what that looks like, reach out. I'd love to meet you. Advisory work is what pays the bills right now, and my kids need to eat. I probably need to eat a little less, but my kids need to eat. So reach out about an advisory relationship if you're looking for some help on growth or product or general company building. It's what I do.

Lenny (01:05:08):
Adam, you're so full of insights and lessons, and I'm so happy that you've started writing and sharing a lot of these things. Folks should definitely subscribe. Fishmanafnewsletter.com. Adam, thank you for being here.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We worked on a guest post together. They had this really key insight that building AI products is very different from building non-AI products.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:00:08):
Most people tend to ignore the non-determinism. You don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. The second difference is the agency control trade-off. Every time you hand over decision-making capabilities to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
This significantly changes the way you should be building product.

Kiriti Badam (00:00:28):
So we recommend building step-by-step. When you start small, it forces you to think about what is the problem that I'm going to solve. In all this advancements of the AI, one easy, slippery slope is to keep thinking about complexities of the solution and forget the problem that you're trying to solve.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:00:42):
It's not about being the first company to have an agent among your competitors. It's about have you built the right flywheels in place so that you can improve over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
What kind of ways of working do you see in companies that build AI products successfully?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:00:55):
I used to work with the CEO of now Rackspace. He would have this block every day in the morning, which would say catching up with AI 4:00 to 6:00 AM. Leaders have to get back to being hands-on. You must be comfortable with the fact that your intuitions might not be right. And you probably are the dumbest person in the room and you want to learn from everyone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):
What do you think the next year of AI is going to look like?

Kiriti Badam (00:01:16):
Persistence is extremely valuable. Successful companies right now building in any new area, they are going through the pain of learning this, implementing this and understanding what works and what doesn't work. Pain is the new moat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:29):
Today, my guests are Aishwarya Reganti and Kiriti Badam. Kiriti works on Kodex at OpenAI and has spent the last decade building AI and ML infrastructure at Google and at Kumo. Ash was an early AI researcher at Alexa and Microsoft and has published over 35 research papers. Together, they've led and supported over 50 AI product deployments across companies like Amazon, Databricks, OpenAI, Google, and both startups and large enterprises. Together, they also teach the number one rated AI course on Maven, where they teach product leaders all of the key lessons they've learned about building successful AI products. The goal of this episode is to save you and your team a lot of pain and suffering and wasted time trying to build your AI product. Whether you are already struggling to make your product work or want to avoid that struggle, this episode is for you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow to your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Head on over to lennysnewsletter.com and click product pass. With that, I bring you Aishwarya, Reganti, and Kiriti Badam after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:49):
This episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders hate building integrations. They're messy. They're slow to build. They're a huge drain on your roadmap, and they're definitely not why you got into product in the first place. Lucky for you, Merge is obsessed with integrations. With a single API, B2B SaaS companies embed Merge into their product and ship 220 plus customer-facing integrations in weeks, not quarters.

(00:03:14):
Think of merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Companies like Mistral AI, Ramp, and Drata use Merge to connect their customers as accounting, HR, ticketing, CRM, and file storage systems to power everything from automatic onboarding to AI-ready data pipelines. Even better, Merge now supports the secure deployment of connectors to AI agents with a new product so that you can safely power AI workflows with real customer data. If your product needs customer data from dozens of systems, Merge is the fastest, safest way to get it. Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny, and they'll send you a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Strella, the customer research platform built for the AI era. Here's the truth about user research. It's never been more important or more painful. Teams want to understand why customers do what they do, but recruiting users running interviews and analyzing insights takes weeks.

(00:04:14):
By the time the results are in, the moment to act has passed. Strella changes that. It's the first platform that uses AI to run and analyze in depth interviews automatically, bringing fast and continuous user research to every team. Strella's AI moderator asks real follow-up questions, probing deeper when answers are vague, and services patterns across hundreds of conversations all in a few hours, not weeks. Product, design, and research teams at companies like Amazon and Duolingo are already using Strella for Figma prototype testing, concept validation, and customer journey research, getting insights overnight instead of waiting for the next sprint. If your team wants to understand customers at the speed you ship products, try Strella. Run your next study at strella.io/lenny. That's S-T-R-E-L-L-A.io/lenny. Ash and Kiriti, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:05:13):
Thank you, Lenny.

Kiriti Badam (00:05:14):
Thank you for having us. Super excited for this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:16):
Let me set the stage for the conversation that we're going to have today. So you two have built a bunch of AI products yourself. You've gone deep with a lot of companies who have built AI products, have struggled to build AI products, build AI agents. You also teach a course on building AI products successfully and you're kind of on this mission to just reduce pain and suffering and failure that you constantly see people go through when they're building AI products. So to set a little just foundation for the conversation we're going to have, what are you seeing on the ground within companies trying to build AI products? What's going well? What's not going well?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:05:54):
I think 2025 has been significantly different than 2024. One, the skepticism has significantly reduced. There were tons of leaders last year who probably thought this would be yet another crypto wave and kind of skeptical to get started. And a lot of the use cases that I saw last year were more of slap chat on your data. And that was calling themselves an AI product. And this year, a ton of companies are really rethinking their user experiences and their workflows and all of that and really understanding that you need to deconstruct and reconstruct your processes in order to build successful AI products. And that's the good stuff. The bad stuff is the execution is still all over the place. Think of it. This is a three-year-old field. There are no playbooks, there are no textbooks. So you really need to figure out as you go. And the AI lifecycle, both pre-deployment and post-deployment is very different as compared to a traditional software lifecycle.

(00:06:57):
And so a lot of old contracts and handoffs between traditional roles, like say PMs and engineers and data folks has now been broken and people are really getting adapted to this new way of working together and kind of owning the same feedback loop in a way. Because previously, I feel like PMs and engineers and all of these folks had their own feedback loops to optimize. And now you need to be probably sitting in the same room. You're probably looking at agent traces together and deciding how your product should behave. So it's a tighter form of collaboration. So companies are still kind of figuring that out. That's kind of what I see in my consulting practice this year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:37):
So let me follow that thread. We worked on a guest post together that came out a few months ago. And the thing that stood out to me most that stuck with me most after working on that post is this really key insight that building AI products is very different from building non-AI products. And the thing that you're big on getting across is there's two very big differences. Talk about those two differences.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:08:01):
Yes. And again, I want to make sure that we drive home the right point. There are tons of similarities of building AI systems and software systems as well, but then there are some things that kind of fundamentally change the way you build software systems versus AI systems. And one of them that most people tend to ignore is the non-determinism. You're pretty much working with a non-deterministic API as compared to traditional software. What does that mean and why does that have to affect us is in traditional software, you pretty much have a very well-mapped decision engine or workflow. Think of something like Booking.com. You have an intention that you want to make a booking in San Francisco for two nights, et cetera. The product has kind of been built so that your intention can be converted into a particular action and you kind of are clicking through a bunch of buttons, options, forms, and all of that, and you finally achieve your intention.

(00:08:59):
But now that layer in AI products has completely been replaced by a very fluid interface, which is mostly natural language, which means the user can literally come up with a ton of ways of saying or communicating their intentions. And that kind of changes a lot of things because now you don't know how your user's going to be here. That's on the input side. And the output is also that you're working with a non-deterministic probabilistic API, which is your LLM. And LLMs are pretty sensitive to prompt phrasings and they're pretty much black boxes. So you don't even know how the output surface will look like. So you don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. So you're now working with an input, output, and a process. You don't understand all the three very well. You're trying to anticipate behavior and build for it.

(00:09:53):
And with agentic systems, this kind of gets even harder. And that's where we talk about the second difference, which is the agency control trade-off. What we mean by that, and I'm kind of shocked so many people don't talk about this. They're extremely obsessed with building autonomous systems, agents that can do work for you. But every time you hand over decision-making capabilities or autonomy to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end. And when you do that, you want to make sure that your agent has gained your trust or it is reliable enough that you can allow it to make decisions. And that's where we talk about this agency controlled trade-off, which is if you give your AI agent or your AI system, whatever it is, more agency, which is the ability to make decisions, you're also losing some control and you want to make sure that the agent or the AI system has earned that ability or has built up trust over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):
So just to summarize what you're sharing here, essentially, people have been building product, software products for a long time. We're now in a world where the software you're building is one, non-deterministic, can just do things differently. As you said, you go to booking.com, you find a hotel, it's going to be the same experience every time. You'll see different hotels, but it's a predictable experience. With AI, you can't predict that it's going to be the exact same thing, the thing that you plan it to be every time. And then the other is there's this trade-off between agency and control. How much will the AI do for you versus how much should the person still be in charge? And what I'm hearing is the big point here is this significantly changes the way you should be building product. And we're going to talk about the impact on how the product development lifecycle should change as a result.

(00:11:35):
Is there anything else you want to add there before we get into that?

Kiriti Badam (00:11:39):
Yeah, it's definitely one of the key points that this kind of distinction needs to exist in your mind when you're starting to build. For example, think about if your objective is to hike Half Dome in Yosemite. You don't start hiking it every day, but you start training yourself in minor parts and then you slowly improve and then you go to the end goal. I feel like that's extremely similar to what you want to build AI products in the sense that when you don't start with agents with all the tools and all the context that you have in the company in day one and expect it to work or even tinker at that level. You need to be deliberately starting in places where there is minimal impact and more human control so that you have a good grip of what are the current capabilities and what can I do with them and then slowly lean into the more agency and lesser control.

(00:12:29):
So this gives you that confidence that, okay, I can know that, okay, this is the particular problem that I'm facing and the AI can solve this extent of it. And then let me next think through what context I need to bring in, what kind of tools I need to add to this to improve the experience. So I feel like also it's a good and a bad thing in the sense that it's good that you don't have to see the complexity of the outside world of all of this fancy AI agents force and feel like I cannot do that. Everyone is starting from very minimalistic structures and then evolving. And the second part is the bad thing is that as you are trying to build this one click agents into your company, you don't have to be overwhelmed with this complexity. You can slowly graduate.

(00:13:16):
So that's extremely important. And we see this as a repeating pattern over and over.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):
Okay. So let's actually follow that because that's a really important component of how you recommend people build AI stuff, AI products, AI agents, all the AI things. So give us an example of what you're talking about here, this idea of starting slow with agency and control and then moving up this rung.

Kiriti Badam (00:13:38):
Yeah. For example, a very important or very prevalent application of AI agents is customer support. Imagine you are a company who has a lot of customer support tickets and why even imagine OpenAI is the exact same thing when we were launching products and there was a huge spike of support volume as we launched successful products like Image or GPT-5 and things like that. The kind of questions you get is different. The kind of problems that the customers bring to you is different. So it's not about just dumping all the list of help center articles that you have into the AI agent. You kind of understand what are the things that you can build. And so initially the first step of it would be something like you have your support agents, the human support agents, but you will be suggesting in terms of, okay, this is what the AI thinks that is the right thing to do.

(00:14:33):
And then you get that feedback loop from the humans that, okay, this is actually a good suggestion for me in this particular case and this is a bad suggestion. And then you can go back and understand, okay, this is what the drawbacks are or this is where the blind spots are, and then how do I fix that? And once you get that, you can increase the autonomy to say that, okay, I don't need to suggest to the human. I'll actually show the answer directly to the customer. And then we can actually add more complexity in terms of, okay, I was only answering questions based on health center articles, but now let me add new functionality. I can actually issue refunds to the customers. I can actually raise feature requests with the engineering team and all of these things. So if you start with all of this on day one, it's incredibly hard to control the complexity.

(00:15:19):
So we recommend building step by step and then increasing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:23):
Awesome. And you have a visual actually that we'll share of what this looks like. But just to kind of mirror back what you're describing, this idea of start with high control, low agency, the example you gave is the support agents just kind of giving suggestions, is not able to do anything, the user is in charge. And then as that becomes useful and you are confident it's doing the right sort of work, you give it a little more agency and you kind of pull back on the control the user has. And then if that's starting to go well, then you give it more agency and the user needs less control to control it. Awesome.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:16:02):
I think the higher level idea here is with AI systems, it's all about behavior calibration. It's incredibly impossible to predict upfront how your system behaves. Now, what do you do about it? You make sure that you don't ruin your customer experience or your end user experience. You keep that as is, but then remove the amount of control that the human has. And there is no single right way of doing it. You can decide how to constrain that autonomy. I mean, a different example of how you could constrain autonomy is pre-authorization use cases. Insurance pre-authorization is a very ripe use case for AI because clinicians spend a lot of time pre-authorizing things like blood tests, MRIs and things like that. And there are some cases which are more of low hanging fruits. For instance, MRIs and block tests, because as soon as you know patient's information, it's easier to approve that and AI could do that versus something like an invasive surgery, et cetera, is more high risk. You don't want to be doing that autonomously.

(00:17:11):
So you can kind of determine which of these use cases should go through that human and the loop layer versus which of the use cases AI can conveniently handle. And then all through this process, you're also logging what the human is doing because you want to build a flywheel that you could use in order to improve your system. So you're essentially not showing the user experience, not eroding trust, at the same time logging what humans would otherwise do so that you can continuously improve your system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:41):
So let me give you a few more examples of this kind of progression that you recommend. And the reason I'm spending so much time here is this is a really key part of your recommendation to help people build more successful AI products. This idea of start slow with high control and low agency and then build up over time once you've built confidence that it's doing the right sort of work. So a few more examples that you shared in your post that I'll just read. So say you're building a coding assistant, V1 would be just suggest inline completion and boilerplate snippets. V2 would be generate larger blocks like tests or refactors for humans to review. And then V3 is just apply the changes and open PRs autonomously. And then another example is a marketing assistant. So V1 would be draft emails or social copy, just like here's what I would do.

(00:18:26):
V2 is build a multi-step campaign and run the campaign. And V3 is just launch it A/B tested auto-optimize campaigns across channels. Awesome. Yeah. And again, just to summarize where we're at, just to give people the advice we've shared so far. One is just important to understand AI products are different. They're non-deterministic. And you pointed out, and I forgot to actually mirror back this point, both on the input and the output. The user experience is non-deterministic.People will see different things, different outputs, different chat conversations, different maybe UI if it's designing the UI for you. And also the output obviously is going to be non-terministic. So that's a problem and a challenge. And then-

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:19:08):
I mean, if you think of it's also the most beautiful part of AI, which is, I mean, we are all much more comfortable talking than following a bunch of buttons and all of that. So the bar to using AI products is much lower because you can be as natural as you would be with humans, but that's also the problem, which is there are tons of ways we communicate and you want to make sure that that intent is rightly communicated and the right actions are taken because most of your systems are deterministic and you want to achieve a deterministic outcome, but with non-deterministic technology and that's where it gets a little messy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:44):
Awesome. Okay. I love the optimistic version of why this is good. Okay. And then the other piece is this idea of this trade-off of autonomy versus control when you're designing a thing. And I imagine what you're seeing is people try to jump to the ideal, like the V3 immediately and that's when they get into trouble both. It's probably a lot harder to build that and it just doesn't work. And then they're just like, "Okay, this is a failure. What are we even doing?"

Kiriti Badam (00:20:08):
Exactly. I feel there's a bunch of things that you actually have to get confidence in before you get to V3. And it's easy to get overwhelmed that, oh, my AI agent is doing these things wrong in a hundred different ways and you're not going to actually tabulate all of them and fix it. Even though you've learned how do you deal with the evaluation practices and stuff like that, if you're starting on the wrong spot, you are actually going to have a hard time correcting things from there. And when you start small and when you start with building a very minimalistic version with high human control and low agency, it also forces you to think about what is the problem that I'm going to solve. We use this term called problem first. And to me, it was obvious in the sense that that I do need to think about the problem, but it's incredible how well it resonates with the people that in all this advancements of the AI that we are seeing, one easy, slippery slope is to just keep thinking about complexities of the solution and forget the problem that you're trying to solve.

(00:21:10):
So when you're trying to start at a smaller scale of autonomy, you start to really think about what is the problem that I'm trying to solve and how do I break it down into levels of autonomy that I can build later? So that is incredibly useful and we keep repeating this part and over and over with everyone we talk to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
And there's so many other benefits to limiting autonomy because there's just danger also of the thing doing too much for you and just messing up your, I don't know, your database, sending out all these emails you never expected. And there's like so many reasons this is a good idea.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:21:45):
Yep. I recently read this paper from a bunch of folks at UC Berkeley. Basically Matei Zaharia, [inaudible 00:21:54] and the folks at Databricks and it said about 74% or 75% of the enterprises that they had spoken to, their biggest problem was reliability. And that's also why they weren't comfortable deploying products to their end users or building customer facing products because they just weren't sure or they just weren't comfortable doing that and exposing their users to a bunch of these risks. And that's also why they think a lot of AI products today have to do with productivity because it's much low autonomy versus end-to-end agents that would replace workflows. And yeah, I love their work otherwise as well, but I think that's very in line with what at least we are seeing at my startup as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
Okay. Very interesting. There's an episode that'll come out before this conversation where we go deep into another problem that this avoids, which is around prompt injection and jailbreaking and just how big of a risk that is for AI products where it's essentially an unsolved and unsolvable problem potentially. I'm not going to go down that track, but that's a pretty scary conversation we had that'll be out before this conversation.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:23:02):
I think that will be a huge problem once systems go mainstream. We're still so busy building AI products that we're not worried about security, but it will be such a huge problem to kind of, especially with this non-deterministic API again. So you're kind of stuck because there are tons of instructions that you could inject within your prompt and then it's going really bad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:28):
Okay. Let's actually spend a little time here because it's actually really interesting to me and no one's talking about this stuff, which is like the conversation we had is just it's pretty easy to get AI to do stuff it shouldn't do. And there's all these guardrail systems people put in place, but turns out these guardrails aren't actually very good and you can always get around them. And to your point, as agents become more autonomous and robots, it gets pretty scary that you could get AI to do things you shouldn't do.

Kiriti Badam (00:23:54):
I think this is definitely a problem, but I feel in the current spectrum of customers adopting AI, the extent to which companies can actually get advantage of AI or improve their processes or streamline the existing processes that they have, I feel it's still in the very early stage. 2025 has been an extremely busy year for AI agents and customers trying to adopt AI, but I feel the penetration is still not as much as you would actually get advantage out of it. So with the right sort of human in the loop points in here, I feel we can actually avoid a bunch of these things and focus more towards streamlining the processes. And I am more on the optimist side in the sense that you need to try and adopt this before actually trying to be only for highlighting the negative aspects of what could go wrong.

(00:24:47):
So I feel like strongly that companies has this adopt this, they definitely ... No company at OpenAI we talk to has never had been the case that, oh, AI cannot help me in this case. It has always been that, oh, there is this set of things that it can optimize for me and then let me see how I can adopt it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:06):
Sweet. I always like the optimistic perspective. I'm excited for you to listen to this and see what you think because it's really interesting. And to your point, there's a lot of things to focus on. It's one of many things to worry about and think about. Okay, let's get back on track here. So we've shared a bunch of pro-tips and important piece of advice. Let me ask, what other patterns and kind of ways of working do you see in companies that do this well and teams that build AI products successfully? And then just what are the most common pitfalls people fall into? So we could just maybe start with, what are other ways that companies do this well, build AI products successfully?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:25:43):
I almost think of it as like a success triangle with three dimensions that's never always technical. Every technology problem is a people problem first. And with companies that we have worked with, it's these three dimensions, like great leaders, good culture and technical prowess. With leaders itself, we work with a lot of companies for their AI transformation, training, strategy and stuff like that. And I feel like a lot of companies, the leaders have built intuitions over 10 or 15 years and they're kind of highly regarded for those intuitions. But now with AI in the picture, those intuitions will have to be relearned and leaders have to be vulnerable to do that. I used to work with the CEO of now Rackspace, Gagan. So he would have this block every day in the morning, which would say catching up with AI 4:00 to 6:00 AM, and he would not have any meetings or anything like that.

(00:26:42):
And that was just his time to pick up on the latest AI podcast or information and all of that. And he would have weekend vibe coding sessions and stuff like that. So I think leaders have to get back to being hands-on. And that's not because they have to be implementing these things, but more of rebuilding their intuitions because you must be comfortable with the fact that your intuitions might not be right and you probably are the dumbest person in the room and you want to learn from everyone. And that I've seen that being a very distinguishing factor of companies that build products which are successful because you're kind of bringing in that top-down approach. It's almost always impossible for it to be bottom-up. You can't have a bunch of engineers go and get buy-in from the leader if they just don't trust in the technology or if they have misaligned expectations about the technology.

(00:27:34):
I've heard from so many folks who are building that our leaders just don't understand the extent to which AI can solve a particular problem or they just vibe code something and assume it's easy to take it to production and you really need to understand the range of what AI can solve today so that you can guide decisions within the company. The second one is the culture itself. And again, I work with enterprises where AI is not their main thing and they need to bring in AI into their processes just because a competitor is doing it. And just because it does make sense because there are use cases that are very ripe. Then along the way, I feel a lot of companies have this culture of FOMO and you will be replaced and those kind of things and people get really afraid. Subject matter experts are such a huge part of building AI products that work because you really need to consult them to understand how your AI is behaving or what the ideal behavior should be.

(00:28:27):
But then I've spoken to a bunch of companies where the subject matter experts just don't want to talk to you because they think their job is being replaced. So I mean, again, this comes from the leader itself. You want to build a culture of empowerment, of augmenting AI into your own workflows so that you can 10X at what you're doing instead of saying that probably you'll be replaced if you don't adopt AI and stuff like that. So that kind of an empowering culture always helps. You want to make your entire organization be in it together and make AI work for you instead of trying to guard their own jobs, et cetera. And with AI, it's also true that it opens up a lot more opportunities than before. So you could have your employees doing a lot more things than before and 10x their productivity. And the third one is the technical part which we talk about.

(00:29:18):
I think folks that are successful are incredibly obsessed about understanding their workflows very well and augmenting parts that could be ripe for AI versus the ones that might need human in the loop somewhere, et cetera. Whenever you're trying to automate some part of a workflow, it's never the case that you could use an AI agent and that will solve your problems. It's always, you probably have a machine learning model that's going to do some part of the job. You have deterministic code doing some part of the job. So you really need to be obsessed with understanding that workflow so you can choose the right tool for the problem instead of being obsessed with the technology itself. And another pattern I see is also folks really understand this idea of working with a non-deterministic API, which is your LLM. And what that means is they also understand the AI development lifecycle looks very different and they iterate pretty quickly, which is can I build something iterate quickly in a way that it doesn't ruin my customer experience at the same time gives me enough amount of data so that I can estimate behavior.

(00:30:31):
So they build that flywheel very quickly. As of today, it's not about being the first company to have an agent among your competitors. It's about, have you built the right flywheels in place so that you can improve over time? When someone comes up to me and says, "We have this one click agent, it's going to be deployed in your system." And then in two or three days, it'll start showing you significant gains. I would almost be skeptical because it's just not possible. And that's not because the models aren't there, but because enterprise data and infrastructure is very messy and you need a bit to ... Even the agent needs a bit to understand how these systems work. There are very messy taxonomies everywhere. People tend to do things like get customer data, we want, get customer data, we do, and these kind of things. And all those functions exist and they're being called and basically there's a lot of tech debt that you need to deal with.

(00:31:23):
So most of the times, if you're obsessed with the problem itself and you understand your workflows very well, you will know how to improve your agents over time instead of just slapping an agent and assuming that it'll work from day one. I probably will go as far to say that if someone's selling you one click-agents, it's pure marketing. You don't want to buy into that. I would rather go with a company that says, "We're going to build this pipeline for you," and that will learn over time and build a flywheel to improve than something that's going to work out of the box. To replace any critical workflow or to build something that can give you significant ROI, it easily takes four to six months of work, even if you have the best data layer and infrastructure layer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):
Amazing. There's a lot there that resonates so deeply with other conversations I've been having on this podcast. One is just for a company to be successful at seeing a lot of impact from AI, the founder-CEO has to be deep into it. I had Dan Shipper on the podcast and they work with a bunch of companies helping them adopt AI. And he said that's the number one predictor of success. Is the CEO chatting with ChatGPT, Claude, whatever, many times a day. I love this example you gave with the Rackspace CEO has catch up on AI news in the morning every day. I was imagining he'd be chatting with the chatbot versus reading news.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:32:42):
With the kind of information you have as of today, you could just ... I mean, you want to choose the right channels as well because everybody has an opinion. So whose opinion do you want to bank on? I feel like having that good quality set of people that you're listening to really makes sense. So he just has a list of two or three sources that he always looks at. And then he comes back with a bunch of questions and bounces it around with a bunch of AI experts to see what they think about it. And I was part of that group, so I kind of know-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:11):
I love that.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:33:13):
... about the questions that he comes up with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:13):
That's cool.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:33:15):
It's pretty cool. I was like, "Why are you doing so much?" And then he says, "It trickles down into a bunch of decisions that we take."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:21):
Okay. Let me talk about another topic that's very ... It's been a hot topic on this podcast. It was a hot topic on Twitter for a while, evals. A lot of people are obsessed with evals, think they're the solution to a lot of problems in AI. A lot of people think they're overrated that you don't need evals. You can just feel the vibes and you'll be all right. What's your take on evals? How far does that take people in solving a lot of the problems that you talk about?

Kiriti Badam (00:33:47):
In terms of what is going on in the community, I feel there's just this false dichotomy of this either evals is going to solve everything or online monitoring or production monitoring is going to solve everything. And I find no reason to trust one of the extremes in the sense that I will entirely bank my application on this or like that to solve the thing. So if you take a step back, think of what are evals. Evals are basically your trusted product thinking or your knowledge about the product that is going into this set of data sets that you're going to build in the sense that this is what matters to me. This is the kind of problems that my agent should not do and let me build a list of datasets so that I'm going to do well on those. And in terms of production monitoring, what you're doing there is you're deploying your application and then you're having some sort of key metrics that actually communicate back to you on how customers are using your product.

(00:34:47):
You could be deploying any agent and if the customer is giving a thumbs up for your interaction, you better want to know that. So that is what production monitoring is going to do. And this production monitoring has existed for products for a long time, just that now with the AI agents, you need to be monitoring a lot more granularity. It's not just the customer always giving you explicit feedback, but there is many implicit feedback that you can get. For example, in ChatGPT, if you are liking the answer, you can actually give a thumbs up. Or if you don't like the answer, sometimes customers don't give you thumbs down, but actually regenerate the answer. So that is a clear indication that the initial answer that regenerator is not meeting the customer's expectation. So these are the kind of implicit signals you always need to think about.

(00:35:35):
And that spectrum has been increasing in terms of production monitoring. Now let's come back to the initial topic of like, okay, is it evals or is it production monitoring? What does it matter? So I feel, again, we go back to this problem first approach of what is it that you're trying to build. You're trying to build a reliable application for your customers that's not going to do a bad thing. It's always going to do the right thing. Or if it is doing a wrong thing, you're basically alerted very quickly. So I break this down into two parts. One is nobody goes into deploying an application without actually just testing that. This testing could be wipes or this testing could be, "Okay, I have this 10 questions that it should not go wrong no matter what changes I make, and let me build this and let's call this an evaluation dataset." Now, let's say you build this, you deployed this, and then you figured, "Okay, now I need to understand whether it's doing the right thing or not."

(00:36:32):
So if you're a high throughput or a high transaction customer, you cannot practically sit and evaluate all the traces. You need some indication to understand what are the things that I should look at. And this is where production monitoring comes into the picture that you cannot predict the base in which your agent could be doing wrong, but all of these other implicit signals and explicit signals, those are going to communicate back to you what are the traces that you need to look at. And that is where production monitoring helps. And once you get this kind of traces, you need to examine what are the failure patterns that you're seeing in these different types of interactions. And is there something that I really care about that should not happen? And if that kind of failure modes are happening, then I need to think about building an evaluation dataset for it.

(00:37:20):
And okay, let's say I built an evaluation dataset for my agent trying to offer refunds where explicitly I have configured it not to. So I built this evaluation dataset and then I made my changes in tools or prompts or whatever, and then I deployed the second version of the product. Now there is no guarantee that this is the only problem that you're going to see. You still need production monitoring to actually catch different kinds of problems that you might encounter. So I feel evals are important, production monitoring is important, but this notion of only one of them is going to solve things for you that is completely dismissible in my opinion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:58):
All right. A very reasonable answer. And the point here isn't, it's not just as simple as do both. It's more that there are different things to catch and one approach won't catch all the things you need to be paying attention to.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:38:11):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:12):
Awesome.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:38:13):
I want to take two steps back and kind of talk about how much weight the term evals has had to take in the second half of 2025 because you go meet a data labeling company and they tell you our experts are writing evals and then you have all of these folks saying that PMs should be writing evals, they're the new PRDs. And then you have folks saying that evals is pretty much everything, which is the feedback loop you're supposed to be building to improve your products. Now, step back as a beginner and kind of think what are evals? Why is everyone saying evals? And these are actually different parts of the process and nobody is wrong in the sense that yes, these are evals, but when a data labeling company is telling you that our experts are writing evals, they're actually referring to error analysis or experts just leading notes on what should be right.

(00:39:02):
Lawyers and doctors write evals, that doesn't mean they're building LLM judges or they're building this entire feedback loop. And when you say that a PM should be writing evals, doesn't mean they have to write an LLM judge that's good enough for production. I think there are also very prescriptive ways of doing this and plus one to KD, which is you cannot predict upfront if you need to be building an LLM judge versus you need to be using implicit signals from production monitoring, et cetera. I think Martin Fowler at some point had this term called semantic diffusion back in the 2000s, which kind of means that someone comes up with a term, everybody starts butchering it with their own definitions and then you kind of lose the actual definition of it. That is what is happening to evals or agents or any word in AI as of today, everybody kind of sees a different side to it, I guess.

(00:39:54):
But if you make a bunch of practitioners sit together and ask them, "Is it important to build an actionable feedback loop for AI products?" I think all of them will agree. Now, how you do that really depends on your application itself. When you go to complex use cases, it's incredibly hard to build LLM judges because you see a lot of emerging patterns. If you built a judge that would test for verbosity or something like that, it turns out that you're seeing newer patterns that your LLM judge is not able to catch, and then you just end up building too many evals. And at that point, it just makes sense to look at your user signals, fix them, check if you have regressed and move on instead of actually building these judges. So it all depends. I think one statement that every ML practitioner will tell you is it really depends on the context. Don't be obsessed with prescriptions they're going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:45):
That's such an important point, this idea that, especially that evals just means many things to different people now. It's just a term for so many things. And it's complicated to just talk about evals when you see it as the stuff data labeling companies are giving you and things PMR, right? And there's also benchmarks. People call benchmarks a little bit evals. It's like-

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:41:03):
I recently spoke to a client who told me, "We do evals." And I was like, "Okay, can you show me your dataset?" And said, "No, we just checked LM Arena and Artificial Analysis. These are independent benchmarks and we know that this model is the right one for our use case." And I'm like, "You're not doing evals. That's not evals. Those are model evals."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:20):
But it makes sense. The word, it could be used in that context. I get why people think that, but yeah, now it's just confusing it even more.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:41:26):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:27):
Just one more line of questioning here that I think that's on my mind is the reason this became kind of a big debate is Cloud Code. The head of Cloud Code, Boris, was like, "Nah, we don't do evals on Cloud Code. It's all vibes." What can you share, Kiriti, on Kodex and the Kodex team, how you approach evals?

Kiriti Badam (00:41:44):
So Kodex, we have this balanced approach of you need to have evals and you need to definitely listen to your customers. And I think Alex has been on your podcast recently and he's been talking about how you're extremely focused on building the right product. And a big part of it is basically listening to your customers. And coding agents are extremely unique compared to agents for other domains in the sense that these are actually built for customizability and these are built for engineers. So coding agent is not a product which is going to solve these top five workflows or top six workflows or whatever. It's meant to be customizable in multi different ways. And the implication of that is that your product is going to be used in different integrations and different kinds of tools and different kinds of things. So it gets really hard to build an evaluation dataset for all kinds of interactions that your customers are going to use your product for.

(00:42:38):
With that said, you also need to understand that, okay, if I'm going to make a change, it's at least not going to damage something that is really core to the product. So we have evaluations for doing that, butt the same time we take extreme care on understanding how the customers are using it. For example, we built this code review product recently and it has been gaining extreme amount of traction. And I feel like many, many bugs in OpenAI as well as even our external customers are getting caught with this. And now let's say if I'm making a model change to the code review or a different kinds of RL mechanism that I trained with it, and now if I'm going to deploy it, I definitely do want A/B test and identify whether it's actually finding the right mistakes and how are users reacting to it? And sometimes if users do get annoyed by your incorrect code regis, they go to the extent of just switching off the product.

(00:43:36):
So those are the signals that you want to look at and make sure that your new changes are doing the right thing. And it's extremely hard for us to think of these kind of scenarios beforehand and develop evaluation data sets for it. So I feel like there's a bit of both. There's a lot of vibes and there's a lot of customer feedback and we are super active on the social media to understand if anybody's having certain types of problems and quickly fix that. So I feel it's a ... How do I put this? It's like a domain of things that you do here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:08):
That makes so much sense. Okay. What I'm hearing, Codex, pro evals, but it's not enough.

Kiriti Badam (00:44:13):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
But also just watch customer behavior and feedback. And also there's some vibes just like, is this feeling good? As I'm using it, generating great code that I'm excited about that I think is great.

Kiriti Badam (00:44:24):
I don't think if anybody's coming and seeing that I have this concrete set of evals that I can bet my life on and then I don't need to think about anything else, it's not going to work. And every new model that you're going to launch, we get together as a team and test different things. Each person is concentrating on something else. And we have this list of hard problems that we have and we throw that to the model and see how well they're progressing. So it's like custom evals for each engineer, you would say, and just understand what the product is doing in its new model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):
If you're a founder, the hardest part of starting a company isn't having the idea, it's scaling the business without getting buried in back office work. That's where Brex comes in. Brex is the intelligent finance platform for founders. With Brex, you get high limit corporate cards, easy banking, high yield treasury, plus a team of AI agents that handle manual finance tasks for you. They'll do all the stuff that you don't want to do, like file your expenses, scour transactions for waste, and run reports all according to your rules. With Brex's AI agents, you can move faster while staying in full control. One in three startups in the United States already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com.

(00:45:43):
We've been talking for almost an hour already, and we haven't even covered your extremely powerful software development workflow for building AI products that you two developed that you teach in your course, that you basically combined all the stuff we've been talking about into a step-by-step approach to building AI products. You call it the continuous calibration, continuous development framework. Let's pull up a visual to show people what the heck we're talking about, and then just walk us through what this is, how this works, how teams can shift the way they build their AI products to this approach to help them avoid a lot of pain and suffering.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:46:18):
Before we go about explaining the life cycle, a quick story on why Kiriti and I came up with this is because there are tons of companies that we keep talking to that have the pressure from their competitors because they're all building agents. We should be building agents that are entirely autonomous. And I did end up working with a few customers where we built these end-to-end agents. And turns out that because you start off at a place where you don't know how the user might interact with your system and what kind of responses or actions the AI might come up with, it's really hard to fix problems when you have this really huge workflow, which is taking four or five steps, making tons of decisions. You just end up debugging so much and then kind of hot fixing to the point where at a time we were building for a customer support use case, which is the example that we give in the newsletter as well.

(00:47:13):
And we had to shut down the product because we were doing so many hot fixes and there was no way we could count all the emerging problems that were coming up. And there's also quite some news online. Recently, I think Air Canada had this thing where one of their agents predicted or hallucinated a policy for a refund, which was not part of their original playbook, and they had to go by it because legal stuff. And there have been a ton of really scary incidents. And that's where the idea comes from. How can you build so that you don't lose customer trust and you don't end up, or your agent or AI system doesn't end up making decisions that are super dangerous to the company itself. At the same time, build a flywheel so that you can improve your product as you go. And that's where we came up with this idea of continuous calibration, continuous development.

(00:48:08):
The idea is pretty simple, which is we have this right side of the loop, which is continuous development, where you scope capability and curate data, essentially get a data set of what your expected inputs are and what your expected outputs should be looking at. This is a very good exercise before you start building any AI product because many times you figure out that a lot of the folks within the team are just not aligned on how the product should behave. And that's where your PMs can really give in a lot more information and your subject matter experts as well. So you have this data set that you know your AI product should be doing really well on. It's not comprehensive, but it lets you get started. And then you set up the application and then design the right kind of evaluation metrics. And I intentionally use the term evaluation metrics, although we say evals because I just want to be very specific in what it is because evaluation is a process, evaluation metrics are dimensions that you want to focus on during the process.

(00:49:07):
And then you go about deploying, run your evaluation metrics. And the second part is the continuous calibration, which is the part where you understand what behavior you hadn't expected in the beginning, right? Because when you start the development process, you have this data set that you're optimizing for, but more often than not, you realize that that data set is not comprehensive enough because users start behaving with your systems in ways that you did not predict. And that's where you want to do the calibration piece. I've deployed my system. Now I see that there are patterns that I did not really expect and your evaluation metrics should give you some insight into those patterns, but sometimes you figure out that those metrics were also not enough and you probably have new error patterns that you have not thought about. And that's where you analyze your behavior, spot error patterns.

(00:49:59):
You apply fixes for issues that you see, but you also design newer evaluation metrics to figure out that they are emerging patterns. And that doesn't mean you should always design evaluation metrics. There are some errors that you can just fix and not really come back to because they're very spot errors. For instance, there's a tool calling error just because your tool wasn't defined well and stuff like that. You can just fix it and move on. And this is pretty much how an AI product lifecycle would look like. But what we specifically also mention is while you're going through these iterations, try to think of lower agency iterations in the beginning and higher control iterations. What that means is constrain the number of decisions your AI systems can make and make sure that they're humans in the loop and then increase that over time because you're kind of building a flywheel of behavior and you're understanding what kind of use cases are coming in or how your users are using the system.

(00:50:59):
And one example I think we give in the newsletter itself is the customer support. This is a nice image that kind of shows how you can think of agency and control as two dimensions. And each of your versions keep on increasing the agency or the ability of your AI system to make decisions and lower the control as you go. And one example that we give is that of the customer support agent, where you can break it down into three versions. The first version is just routing, which is your agent able to classify and route a particular ticket to the right department? And sometimes when you read this, you probably think, is it so hard to just do routing? Why can't an agent easily do that? And when you go to enterprises, routing itself can be a super complex problem. Any retail company, any popular retail company that you can think of has hierarchical taxonomies.

(00:51:52):
Most of the times the taxonomies are incredibly messy. I have worked in use cases where you probably have taxonomy that says some kind of hierarchy and then that says shoes and then women's shoes and men's shoes all at the same layer where idea you should be having shoes and then women's shoes and men's shoes should be subclasses. And then you're like, okay, fine. I could just merge that. And you go further and you see that there's also another section on the shoes that says for women and for men, and it's just not aggregated. It's not fixed for some reason. So if an agent kind of sees this kind of a taxonomy, what is it supposed to do? Where is it supposed to route? And a lot of the times we are not aware of these problems until you actually go about building something and understanding it.

(00:52:39):
And when these kind of problems, real human agents see these kind of problems, they know what to check next. Maybe they realize that the node that says for women and for men that's under shoes was last updated in 2019, which means that it's just a dead node that's lying there and not being used. So they kind of know that, okay, we're supposed to be looking at a different node and stuff like that. And I'm not saying agents cannot understand this or models are not capable enough to understand this, but there are really weird rules within enterprises that are not documented anywhere. And you want to make sure that the agents have all of that context instead of just throwing the problem at that.

(00:53:17):
Yeah. Coming back to the versions we had, routing was one where you have really high control because even if your agent routes to the wrong department, humans can take control and undo those actions. And along the way, you also figure out that you probably are dealing with a ton of data issues that you need to fix and make sure that your data layer is good enough for the agent to function. We do is what we said of a Copilot, which is now that you've figured out routing works fine after a few iterations and you've fixed all of your data issues, you could go to the next step, which is, can my agent provide suggestions based on some standard operating procedures that we have for the customer support agent? And it could just generate a draft that the human can make changes to. And when you do this, you're also logging human behavior, which means that how much of this draft was used by the customer support agent or what was omitted. So you're actually getting error analysis for free when you do this because you're literally logging everything that the user is doing that you could then build back into your flywheel.

(00:54:22):
And then we say, post that, once you've figured out that those drafts look good and most of the times maybe humans are not making too many changes, they're using these drafts as is. That's when you want to go to your end-to-end resolution assistant that could draft a resolution that could solve the ticket as well. And those are the stages of agency where you start with low agency and then you go up high. We also have this really nice table that we put together, which is what do you do at each version and what you learn that can enable you to go to the next step and what information do you get that you can feed into the loop, right? When you're just doing your routing, you have better quality routing data, you also know what kind of prompts you need to be building to improve the routing system.

(00:55:09):
Essentially, you're figuring out your structure for context engineering and building that flywheel that you want. And while I go through this, I want to also be very clear that two things. One is when you build with CCCD in mind, it doesn't mean that you've fixed the problem all for one. It's possible that you've probably gone through V3 and you see a new distribution of data that you never previously imagined, but this is just one way to lower your risk, which is you get enough information about how users behave with your system before going to a point of complete autonomy. And the second thing is you're also kind of building this implicit logging system. A lot of people come and tell us that, "Oh, wait, there are evals. Why do you need something like this? " The issue with just building a bunch of evaluation metrics and then having them in production is evaluation metrics catch only the errors that you're already aware of, but there can be a lot of emerging patterns that you understand only after you put things in production.

(00:56:17):
So for those emerging patterns, you're kind of creating a low risk kind of a framework so that you could understand user behavior and not really be in a position where there are tons of errors and you're trying to fix all of them at once. And this is not the only way to do it. There are tons of different ways. You want to decide how you constrain your autonomy. It could be based on the number of actions that the agent is taking, which is what we do in this example. It could be based on topic. There's just some domains where it's pretty high risk to make a system completely autonomous for certain decisions, but for some other topics, it's okay to make them completely autonomous and depending on the complexity of the problem. And that's where you really want your product managers, your engineers and subject matter experts to align on how to build this system and continuously improve it.

(00:57:10):
The idea is just behavior calibration and not losing user trust as you do that behavior calibration, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):
We'll link folks to this actual post if they want to go really deep. You basically go through all of these steps by step, a bunch of examples. And the idea here is, as you said, that the reason, everything about what you're describing here is about making it continuous and iterative and kind of moving along this progression of higher autonomy, less control. And this idea of even calling continuous calibration, continuous development is communicating it's this kind of iterative process. And just to be clear, this naming is kind of ode to CI/CD, continuous integration, continuous deployment suite. And the idea here is that this is the version of that for AI where instead of just integrating into unit tests and deploying constantly, it's running evals, looking at results, iterating on the metrics you're watching, figuring out where it's breaking and iterating on that. Awesome. Okay.

(00:58:08):
So again, we'll point people to this post if they want to go deeper. That was a great overview. Is there anything else before we go into different topic around this framework specifically that you think is important for people to know?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:58:18):
I think one of the most common questions we get is, how do I know if I need to go to the next stage or if this is calibrated enough? There's not really a rule book you can follow, but it's all about minimizing surprise, which means let's say you're calibrating every one or two days and you figure out that you're not seeing new data distribution patterns, your users have been pretty consistent with how they're behaving with the system. Then the amount of information you gain is kind of very low and that's when you know you can actually go to the next stage. And it's all about the wipes at that point, do you know you're ready, you're not receiving any new information. But also it really helps to understand that sometimes there are events that could completely mess up the calibration of your system. An example is GPT-4o doesn't exist anymore, or it's going to be deprecated in APIs as well.

(00:59:16):
So most companies that were using 4o should switch to 5 and 5 has very different properties. So that's where your calibration's off again. You want to go back and do this process again. Sometimes users start behaving with systems also differently over time or user behavior evolves. Even with consumer products, you don't talk to ChatGPT the same way you were talking, say, two years ago, just because you know the capabilities have increased so much. And also just people get excited when these systems can solve one task, they want to try it out on other tasks as well. We built this system for underwriters at some point. Underwriting is a painful task. There are agreements that are like loan applications are like 30 or 40 pages, and the idea for this bank was to build a system that could help underwriters pick policies and information about the bank so that they could approve loans.

(01:00:15):
And for a good three or four months, everybody was pretty impressed with the system. We had underwriters actually report gains in terms of how much time they were spending, et cetera. And first three months, we realized that they were so excited with the product that they started asking very deep questions that we never anticipated. They would just throw the entire application document at the system and go, "For a case that looks like this, what did previous underwriters do? " And for a user, that just seems like a natural extension of what they were doing, but the building behind it should significantly change. Now, you need to understand what does for a case like this mean in the context of the loan itself? Is it referring to people of a particular income range or is it referring to people in a particular geo and stuff like that?

(01:00:58):
And then you need to pick up historical documents, analyze those documents, and then tell them, "Okay, this is what it looks like," versus just saying that there's a policy X, Y, and Z, and you want to look up that policy. So something that might seem very natural to an end user might be very hard to build as a product builder, and you see that user behavior also evolves over time, and that's when you know that you want to go back and recalibrate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:24):
What do you think is overhyped in the AI space right now? And even more importantly, what do you think is under-hyped?

Kiriti Badam (01:01:34):
As I said, super optimistic in different things that are going in AI. So I wouldn't say overhyped, but I feel kind of misunderstood is the concept of multi-agents. People have this notion of, "I have this incredibly complex problem. Now I'm going to break it down into, hey, you are this agent. Take care of this. You're this agent. Take care of this." And now if I somehow connect all of these agents, they think they're the agent utopia and it's never the case that there are incredibly successful multi-agent systems that are built. There's no doubt about that. But I feel a lot of it comes in terms of how are you limiting the ways in which the system can go off tracks. And for example, if you're building a supervisor agent and there are subagents that actually do the work for the super agent, supervisor agent, that is a very successful pattern.

(01:02:24):
But coming with this notion of I'm going to divide the responsibilities based on functionality and somehow expect all of that to work together in some sort of gossip protocol, that is extremely misunderstood that you could do that. I don't think current ways of building and current model capabilities are right there in terms of building those kind of applications. I feel that is kind of misunderstood than overrated. Underrated, I feel it's hard to probably believe, but I still feel coding agents are underrated in the sense that I feel like you can go on Twitter and you can go on Reddit and you see a lot of chatter about coding agents, but talking to an engineer in any random company, especially outside of Bay Area, you can see the amount of impact this coding agents can create and the penetration is very low. So I feel like 2025 and 2026 is going to be an incredible year for optimizing all of these processes.

(01:03:25):
And I feel that is going to be creating a lot of value with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):
That's really interesting on that first point. So the idea there is you'll probably be more successful building and using an agent that is able to do its own sub-agent splitting of work versus a bunch of, say, Codex agents. Will you do this task, you do that task?

Kiriti Badam (01:03:44):
You can have agents to do these things and you as a human can orchestrate it or you can have one larger agent that is going to orchestrate all of these things, but letting the agents communicate in terms of peer-to-peer kind of protocol, and then especially doing this in a customer support kind of use case is incredibly hard to control what kind of agent is replying to your customer because you need to shift your guardrails everywhere and things like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):
Yeah. Okay. Great picks. Okay. Ash, what do you got?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:04:12):
Can I say evals? Will I be canceled?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):
In which category? Which bucket do they go?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:04:18):
Overrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):
Overrated. Okay, go for it. We won't let you get canceled.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:04:22):
Just kidding. I think evals are misunderstood. They are important, folks. I'm not saying they're not important, but I think just this, I'm going to keep jumping across tools and going to pick up and learn if new tool is overrated. I still am old school and feel like you would really need to be obsessed with the business problem you're trying to solve. AI is only a tool. I try to think of it that way. Of course, you need to be learning about the latest and greatest, but don't be so obsessed with just building so quickly. Building is really cheap today. Design is more expensive, really thinking about your product, what you're going to build. Is it going to really solve a pain point? Is what is way more valuable today? And it will only become more true in the near future. So really obsessing about your problem and design is underrated and just rote building is overrated, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Awesome. Okay. Similar sort of question. From a product point of view, what do you think the next year of AI is going to look like? Give us a vision of where you think things are going to go by, say by the end of 2026.

Kiriti Badam (01:05:30):
Yeah, I feel there's a lot of promise in terms of this background agents are proactive agents who is ... They're going to basically understand your workflow even more. If you think of where is AI failing to create value today, it's mainly about not understanding the context. And the reason that it's not understanding the context is it's not plugged into the right places where actual work is happening. And as you do more of this, you can give the agent more of context and then it start to see the world around you and understand what are the set of metrics that you're optimizing for or what are the kind of activities that you're trying to do. It is a very easy extension from there to actually gain more out of it and then let the agent prompt you back. We already do this in terms of ChatGPT pulse, which kind of gives you this daily update of things you might care about.

(01:06:20):
And it's very nice to actually have that jog your brain up in terms of, "Oh, this is something that I haven't thought about. Maybe this is good." And now when you extend this to more complex tasks, like a coding agent, which says that, "Okay, I have fixed five of your linear tickets and here are the patches. Just to review them at the start of your day." So I feel that is going to be extremely useful. And I see that as a strong direction in which products are going to build in 2026.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:44):
That's so cool. So essentially agents anticipating what you want to do and getting ahead of you and I've solved these problems for you or I think this is going to crash your site. Maybe you should fix this thing right here or I see the spike here and let's refactor our database. Amazing. What a world. Okay. Ash, what do you got?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:07:04):
I'm all in for multimodal experiences in 2026. I think we have done quite some progress in 2025, and not just in terms of generation, but also understanding. Until now, I think LLMs have been our most commonly used modules, but as humans, we are multimodal creatures, I would say. Language is probably one of our last forms of evolution. As the three of us are talking, I think we're constantly getting so many signals. I'm like, "Oh, Lenny's nodding his head, so probably I would go in this direction or Lenny's bored, so let me stop talking." So there's a chain of thought behind your chain of thought and you're constantly altering it with language that dimension of expression is not explored as well. So if we could build better multimodal experiences that would get us closer to human-like conversation richness. And you will also, just given the kind of models, there's a bunch of boring tasks as well, which are ripe for AI.

(01:08:04):
If multimodal understanding gets better, there are so many handwritten documents and really messy PDFs that cannot be passed even by the best of the models as of today. And if it's possible, there'll be so much data that we can tap into.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:21):
Awesome. I just saw Demis from DeepMind, AI, Google, whatever they call the whole org, talking about this where he thinks that's going to be a big part of where they're going, combining the image model work, the LLM, and also their world model stuff, Genie, I think is what it's called. Yes. So that's going to be a wild, wild time. Okay. Last question. If someone wants to just get better at building AI products, what's just maybe one skill or maybe two skills that you think they should lean into and develop?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:08:52):
I think we did cover a bunch of best practices for AI products, which is start small, try to get your iteration going well and build a flywheel and all of that. But again, if you kind of look at it at a 10,000 feet level for anybody building today, like I was saying, implementation is going to be ridiculously cheap in the next few years. So really nail down your design, your judgment, your taste and all of that. And in general, if you're building a career as well, I feel for the past few years, your former years, say the first two, three years of building your career is always focused on execution, mechanics and all of that. And now we have AI that could help you ramp pretty quickly and post that. I mean, after a few years, I think everybody's job becomes about your taste, your judgment and kind of what is uniquely you.

(01:09:49):
I think nail down on that part and try to figure out how you can bring in that kind of a perspective. It doesn't have to mean that you should be significantly old, have years of experience. We recently hired someone and we use this very popular app for tracking our tasks and we've been using it for years and we pay a high subscription fee for it. And this guy just came with his own vibe coded app to the meeting. He onboarded us to all of it and he's like, "Okay, let's start using this." And I think that kind of agency and that kind of ownership to really rethink experiences is what will set people apart. And I'm not being blind to the fact that vibe coded apps have high maintenance costs. And maybe as we scale as a company, we have to replace it or we have to think of better approaches.

(01:10:36):
But given that we are a small size company now and just ... I was really shocked because I never thought of it. If you've been used to working in a certain way, you associate a cost with building. And I feel like folks who grew up in this age have a much lower cost associated in their mind. They just don't mind building something and going ahead with it. And they're also very enthusiastic to try out new tools. That's also probably why AI products have this retention problem because everybody's so excited about trying out these new tools and all of that. But essentially having the agency and ownership, and I think it's also the going to be the end of the busy work era. You can't be sitting in a corner doing something that doesn't move the needle for a company. You really need to be thinking about end-to-end workflows, how you can bring in more impact.

(01:11:26):
I think all of that will be super important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):
That reminds me, I just had Jason Lemkit on the podcast. He's very smart on sales, go to market, run Saster, and he replaced his whole sales team with agents. He had 10 salespeople and then he was 1.2 and 20 agents. And one of the agents, it was just tracking everyone's updates to Salesforce and kind of updating it automatically for them based on their calls. And one of the salespeople was like, "Okay, I quit." And it turned out he wasn't really doing anything. He was just sitting around and he's like, "Okay, this will catch me. I got to get out of here. So to your point about, it'll be harder to sit around and twiddle your thumbs, I think is really right.

Kiriti Badam (01:12:07):
Yeah. I think to add on to that, I feel like persistence is also something that is extremely valuable, especially given that anybody who wants to build something, the information is at your fingertips even more than the past decade. You can learn anything overnight and become that sort of Ironman kind of approach. So I feel like having that persistence and going through the pain of learning this, implementing this and understanding what works and what doesn't work. And as you are going through this pain of developing multiple approaches and then solving the problem, I feel that is going to be the real moat as an individual. I like to call it pain is the new moat, but I feel that is exactly super useful to actually have this in, especially in building these AI products.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:56):
Say more about this. I love this concept. Pain is the new moat. Is there more there?

Kiriti Badam (01:13:00):
Yeah, I feel as a company, I mean, successful companies right now building in any new area, they are successful not because they're first to the market or they have this fancy feature that more customers are liking it. They went through the pain of understanding what are the set of non-negotiable things and trade them off exactly with what are the features or what are the model capabilities that they can use to solve that problem. This is not a straightforward process. There's no textbook to do this or there's no straightforward way or a known credit path to be here. So a lot of this pain I was talking about is just going through this iteration of like, "Okay, let's try this and if this doesn't work, let's try this." And that kind of knowledge that you built across the organization or across your own lived experiences, I feel that pain is what translates into the moat of the company. This could be a product of evals or something that you built. And I feel that is going to be the game changer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
That is awesome. It's like turning a coal into diamond.

Kiriti Badam (01:14:03):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:04):
Okay. I feel like we've done a great job helping people avoid some of the biggest issues people consistently run into building AI products. We covered so many of the pitfalls and the ways to actually do it correctly. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:14:25):
Be obsessed with your customers. Be obsessed with the problem. AI is just a tool and try to make sure that you're really understanding your workflows. 80% of so called AI engineers, AIPMs spend their time actually understanding their workflows very well. They're not building the fanciest and the most cool models or workflows around it. They're actually in the weeds understanding their customer's behavior and data. And whenever a software engineer who's never done AI before, here's the term, look at your data. I think it's a huge revelation to them, but it's always been the case. You need to go there, look at your data, understand your users, and that's going to be a huge differentiator.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):
That's a great way to close it. The AI isn't the answer. It's a tool to solve the problem. With that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for both of you. Are you ready?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:15:22):
Yay. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
All right. So you can both answer them. You can pick one which you want to answer. Either way, up to you. What are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:15:32):
For me, it's this book called When Breath Becomes Air, Lenny. It was written by Paul Kalanithi. I think he was an Indian original neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with lung cancer at 31 or 32. And the whole book is his memoir and just is written after he was diagnosed. And it's really beautiful, especially because I read it during COVID and all we ever wanted to do during COVID is stay alive. There are a bunch of really nice quotes within the book as well, but I remember one of them, he was kind of arguing against a very popular quote by Socrates, which is, "The unexamined life is not worth living," or something like that, which means you really need to be thinking about your choices, you need to understand your values, your mission and all of that. And Paul says, "If the unexamined life is not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?" Which means are you spending so much time just understanding your mission and purpose that you've forgotten to live?

(01:16:32):
And I think everybody who's staying in the AI era and building and continuously going through the space of reinventing themselves need to take a pause and live for a bit, I guess. They need to stop evaling life too much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:46):
I was going to say that. That's where my mind went. You got to write some evals for your life. Oh my God, we've gone too far.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:16:52):
Yep. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):
Beautiful.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:16:53):
That's my favorite book.

Kiriti Badam (01:16:55):
I like more of science fiction books. So I really like this 3 Body problem series. It's like a three book series. It has elements of grander than science fiction, life outside earth and how it impacts human decision making process. And it also has elements of geopolitics and how much important or valuable abstract science is to human progress. And then when that gets stopped, it's not noticeable in everyday life, but it can cause devastating effects. So I feel like AI helping in these areas, for example, is going to be extremely crucial. And that book is a nice example of what could happen otherwise.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):
Completely agree. Absolutely. Love. Might be my favorite sci-fi book except, or series even, and it's three. I have to read of all three, by the way. I find that it only got really good about one and a half books in. So if anyone's tried it and like, "What the heck is going on here?" Just keep reading and get to the middle of the second one and then it gets mind-blowing.

Kiriti Badam (01:17:52):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:54):
If you love sci-fi and you're in AI, you got to read this book called A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernon Vinge. Check it out. It's incredible. I saw Noah Smith on his newsletter recommend this book and there's sequels to it, but this is the one that's so incredible. And it's actually, it turns out it's about AGI and super intelligence and all these things, and it's just so epic. And no one's heard of it.

Kiriti Badam (01:18:19):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:20):
There you go. I'm giving you one back. Okay, next question. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:18:26):
I started rewatching Silicon Valley and I think it's so true. It's so timeless. Everything is repeating all over again. Anybody who's watched it a few years ago should start rewatching it and you'll see that it's eerily similar to everything that's happening right now with the AI wave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:41):
That's a good idea to rewatch it. I love that their whole business was like an algorithm to compress, like a compression algorithm. It's like maybe a precursor to LLMs in some small way. No, I get it. All right, Kiriti, what you got?

Kiriti Badam (01:18:54):
I'm going to drag this and say lot a movie or a TV show, but there's this game I picked up recently called Expedition 33. It has nothing to do with AI, but it's an incredibly well-made game in terms of the gameplay or the movie and the story and the music. It's been amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:10):
I love that you have time to play games. That's a great sign. I love that. Someone OpenAI, I'm just imagining you're ... There's nothing else going on except just coding and having meetings.

Kiriti Badam (01:19:20):
Yeah, it has been incredibly hard to find time for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:22):
That's good. That's a good sign. I'm happy to hear this. Okay. What's a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:19:28):
For me, it's Whisper Flow. I think I've been using it quite a bit and I didn't know I needed it so much. The best part is it's a conceptual transcription tool, which means if you go to Codex and start using Whisper Flow, it starts identifying variables and all of that. And it's so seamless in terms of transcription to instruction. You could say something like, "I'm so excited today. Add three exclamation marks," and it seamlessly switches. It adds those three exclamation marks instead of writing add three exclamation marks. And I think it's pretty cool. If you're not using it, you should try it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:03):
I'll do a plug. Get Whisper Flow for free for an entire year for a year for free by becoming an annual subscriber of my newsletter.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:20:12):
That's how I got access to it, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:14):
There we go. I think I pitched this deal. I think people don't truly understand how incredible this is. They're like, "No way this is real. It's real." And 18 other products, lennysproductpass.com, check it out. Moving on. Kiriti.

Kiriti Badam (01:20:28):
Awesome. I actually am a stickler for productivity. I keep experimenting new CLI tools and things which can make me faster. So I feel like a Raycast has been amazing. I've discovered all this new shortcuts that you can use to open different things, type in shortcut commands and things like that. And Caffeinate is another thing that I've recently discovered from my teammates. It helps you prevent Mac from sleeping so you can run this really long Codex task for four or five hours locally, let it build the thing and then you can wake up and be like, "Okay, this is good. I like this."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):
That's hilarious, that combo. Codex and Caffeinate. You guys need to use it, build that yourself, an OpenAI version of that, or the Codex agent should just keep your Mac from sleeping. That's so funny. By the way, Raycast, also part of Lenny's product pass. One year for your Raycast. Amazing. Yeah.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:21:20):
Lenny didn't tell us these folks. Yes. These are actually our favorite products.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):
These are just two of 19 products. No Caffeinate though. I don't know if that's even paid. Okay, let's keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to in work or in life?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:21:35):
For me, I think this is one my dad told me when I was a kid and it's always stuck, which is they told it couldn't be done, but the fool didn't know it, so he did it anyway. I think be foolish enough to believe that you can do anything if you put your heart to it, especially now because you have so much data at your hand that could be pointing towards the fact that you probably will be unsuccessful. How many podcasts made it to more than a thousand subscribers or how many companies hit more than one million ARR? And there's always data to show you that you won't be successful, but sometimes just be foolish and go ahead with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:12):
That's great. Yeah.

Kiriti Badam (01:22:13):
For me, I am more of an overthinker. So I really like this quote from Steve Jobs that you can only connect the dots looking backwards. So a lot of the times there are numerous choices and you don't really know the optimal one to pick, but life works in ways that you can actually see back and be like, "Oh, these are actually beautiful in terms of how our transition." So I feel like that is extremely useful in keep moving forward, keep experimenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:39):
Final question. Whenever I have two guests on the podcast at once, I like to ask this question. What's something that you admire about the other person?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:22:48):
I think with Kiriti, he's pretty calm and very grounded and he's always been my sounding board. I can throw a ton of ideas at him and he always comes up with, he's able to anticipate the kind of issues that might land into. And he's extremely kind and lets his work speak instead of actually doing a lot of talking, I guess. But if I had to pick one, I think he's the most incredible husband.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:20):
Reveal. Little did people know.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:23:25):
We've been married for four years and been the most beautiful four years of my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):
Wow. Okay. How do you follow that?

Kiriti Badam (01:23:34):
Yeah, it's super hard to follow that. I would say I am extremely privileged in terms of working with really smart people in great companies in the Silicon Valley. And I feel the unique thing that stands with Aishwarya across like any other smart folks I've worked on is she has this really amazing knack of teaching and explaining something in a very understandable and easy to comprehend way. And that combined with persistence is super useful, especially in this fast-moving AI world that we are in the sense that there's so many new things coming up. It feels overwhelming, but when I hear her talk about, this is how you make sense of this entire thing, this is where it plugs in. I feel like, oh, that is so simple. I can also do that. So she empowers a lot of people by simplifying things and explaining things in the most understandable way.

(01:24:25):
So I feel that is an incredible quality.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
Amazing. How sweet. I got to do this all the time. I need more guest to do it. That was great. Okay. Final questions. Where can folks find stuff that you're working on, find you online, share your course link, and then just how can listeners be useful to you?

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:24:41):
I write a lot on LinkedIn. So if you want to listen to pragmatists who've been in the weeds, working on AI products and what they're seeing, you can follow my work. We also have a GitHub repository with about 20K stars, and that repository is all about good resources for learning AI. It's completely free. And if you like what we spoke today, we also run a super popular course. We leave a link to it on building enterprise AI products. And the course is a lot about unlearning mindsets and following a problem-first approach instead of a tool-first or a hype-first approach. So you can check that out as well. And if you don't want to do the course, we write a lot, we give out a lot of free resources, we have free sessions, so make sure you follow our work.

Kiriti Badam (01:25:27):
Yeah, I would also add that you can also find me on LinkedIn. I don't write a lot, I guess, but I'm super all excited to just talk to any complex product that you're building. And if you have thoughts on how you can use coding agents to make your life better or however the problems that you're seeing, always my DMs are open and we can have a great discussion.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:47):
Awesome. Well, Kiriti and Ash, thank you so much for being here.

Kiriti Badam (01:25:52):
Thank you so much.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:25:53):
Thank you, Lenny. This was so much fun.

# Thinking like a gardener, slime mold, the adjacent possible: Product advice from Alex Komoroske

## Transcript

Alex Komoroske (00:00:00):
So much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like I have a plan. I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen. And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. What I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. If you do this properly, it looks like magic. I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get, including products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Today, my guest is Alex Komoroske. Alex is one of the most original, articulate, and first principle thinkers on the future of product and tech that I've ever come across. This conversation will get your brain buzzing in all kinds of ways. Alex spent 13 years at Google where he worked on Search, DoubleClick. He led Chrome's Open Web Platform team for eight years, led augmented reality within Google Maps, and developed a new toolkit to align company-wide strategy from the bottom up. After a stint at Stripe as head of corporate strategy, he's currently founding a startup that aims to reimagine the web for the AI era.

(00:01:13):
In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover how LLMs and gen AI will impact how we build product in the coming years, what skills will matter most as AI becomes a bigger part of our lives, what companies can learn from slime mold, organizational kayfabe, the adjacent possible, strategy salons, why you should be thinking more like a gardener than a builder, plus a bunch of productivity tips, life advice, and so much more. This was such a fun episode, and I'm sure this is going to get your mind thinking in completely new ways.

(00:01:57):
Alex, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Alex Komoroske (00:02:01):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):
I love the way your brain works. My brain immediately starts buzzing anytime I start reading some of your stuff. And one of the more interesting things that you write and do and a really interesting habit you have is you actually have this doc that you keep called Bits and Bobs that I love, and we're going to be touching on a lot of the things that you share in this doc, Bits and Bobs, and we'll link to it. First of all, can you just explain this doc, Bits and Bobs, what's it about?

Alex Komoroske (00:02:27):
Yeah. I think it's like 600 pages now. It's this one Google Doc. Every so often, almost every day, someone will accidentally add a suggestion like add a space or something because it takes so long to load that while they're waiting, they'll tap on the screen and then it'll turn into taps on adding a comment or something. And I take a lot of notes. And people, I tell people when I'm in meetings with them of like, "If you see me on my phone or typing, that means I think you said something very interesting and I'm writing it down. It's not that I'm just that I'm disengaged. I try to collect all these ideas." And then once a week, I go through, I take a few hours and I just reflect to myself and try to find patterns and unpack and find meaning and things. And I write those down and I started sometime in the past sharing those publicly, and it's now become a thing I literally can't stop doing.

(00:03:17):
I just find someone who was like, "Oh, if you get more exposure for this, if you broke these up into tweets that you sent out once throughout the day," it's like, I did this for me. I'm happy to let other people see and peek into my weird mental process if they want, but this is 100% about my own self-reflection. And it's not designed. I don't want anyone to feel compelled to read it or... In fact, it's designed a little bit to be, I allow myself to be a little bit illegible. I want people to have to work a little bit with it. And it's not going to lay it out on a platter. It's going to jump between different things. I'll use terminology sometimes that is, what are you talking about? And I do that specifically. I don't want anyone to read and be like, "Oh, it sucks. It wasn't worth my time." It's like, "Cool." It's a 600-page Google Doc of my just unspooled insights. It's okay for you to not want to dive into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:09):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams, companies like Twitch, Meero, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.

(00:04:40):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel.

Alex Komoroske (00:06:21):
I started it many years ago in the same conceptual thing, taking a bunch of notes. I have a thing called The Compendium, which is an open source tool. If you look at it currently, it looks like I haven't touched it in years, but that's actually incorrect. I built this about five years ago. I use it every day. And so I have, I think let's see, I currently have 17,248 unpublished working notes. And so what I do during the week is I'm taking notes very quickly in meetings, and then every day or two, I go through and I process them and put them in as working notes in The Compendium, and this is where I correct misspellings. I add just a little bit more context so that it will make sense to me if I were to read it in a year.

(00:06:58):
And also, I built a feature into it that uses embeddings to find similar cards. I find similar ideas from the past. And then what I do on Friday afternoons is I sit down and I go through all the notes I added that week and I just click and check the ones that still resonate with me, they still seem interesting in some way. And then I have a little export thing. I put it into a Google Doc, and while the kids are napping on the weekends, I just go through them and try to distill them a little bit more in a more long-term format. And then on Monday mornings, I publish them. And again, it's a deep... For me, it's like I can't imagine not doing this. It is the place where I find most of my most interesting insights is by reflecting on interesting conversations from the week before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:39):
As we get into the conversation, people get to see how deeply you think about stuff. Part of the reason you're able to think so deeply about stuff is you have this practice where you take time to reflect and share and crystallize. There's so much power in just forcing yourself to write it out, I imagine versus, just not.

Alex Komoroske (00:07:54):
100%. I find that when you're busy, you're constantly just go, go, go, go. There's no time to do any deep thinking. Deep thinking takes time and space, and you got to create that space. The mundane, pointless bullshit will take every square inch you give it. So you got to make that space to sit back and reflect and luxuriate in these ideas. And when you do, you're often like, "Oh my God. Oh wow, that's one I'll keep."

(00:08:18):
And I told people, back at the very beginning of my career, I used to work from home on Fridays. And people gave me so much shit for this and they'd say, "Oh, you're working from home on Fridays." First of all, I will line up my output any day of the week. I'm very proud of the impact I've had. Second of all, Monday through Thursday, I'm in meetings from 8:00 to 6:00 or whatever. I'm just running between. I'm singing, pinging people and scheduling things and flinging action items. And the one day I don't take meetings is on Friday, and that's the day I read documents carefully that people had sent me or reflect. And I think to myself, what is the thing that if I had done it before the week started would've saved me tons of time and effort that week?

(00:08:58):
So for example, maybe in 10 different one-on-ones with people on the team, I had to explain to them a strategic thing that we were doing or a change that we were making. And the idea and the way I framed it worked for everybody. Well, you know what? That should probably be a document, right? If the same idea worked for 10 different people and now in the future there's probably 10 other people that need to hear it, and now I'll write that document in 30 minutes and now I have it as a memorialized thing that other people can read on their own time without having to involve me.

(00:09:24):
And you also find these interesting ideas sometimes where you look at this problem that you're banging your head against, you go, "Oh wait, if I will like that, that would've a wildly different dynamic." And you can only find those when you take a step back. And I find that people, I told someone, I mentored someone, I've mentored hundreds of PMs over the years and I told someone that at one point and they go, "Oh, I wish I had the time." And it's like, you got to make the time. All of us are busy and we will always be busy. And so this to me is not something I do to just for the enjoyment of all. I do deeply enjoy it intrinsically. It's something I do because I think it makes me more productive and effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
I'm very tempted to go down a whole direction of just how you structure your time and your productivity calendar and all this stuff, but I'm not going to do that. That could be another episode if I do.

Alex Komoroske (00:10:09):
I do for that for hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):
What I want to do instead is pick on some of the Bits and Bobs that you've been focusing on noodling on that I think are going to be really helpful to listeners in how they think about product and the future of AI and all these things that I think are emerging. And the first one is actually that I want to get your thoughts on how AI and LLMs are likely to impact product development. A lot of the listeners of this podcast are PMs, engineers, founders, people building software, and you're spending a lot of time thinking about AI and product development. A lot of your Bits and Bobs have been just like, "Here's what's happening. Holy shit. This is how things are going to be." So let me just ask you this how do you anticipate LLMs and gen AI are going to change how products are built in the next three to five years?

Alex Komoroske (00:10:56):
I think they change a lot. I think LLMs are truly a disruptive technology. In fact, I would argue that what we're seeing in the industry is us trying to use mature playbooks from the end stage of the last tech era in one that doesn't really fit yet. To me, LLMs are magical duct tape. They're formed principally by the distilled intuition of all of society into a thing that operates between, a cost structure between human and plain old computing. So much of how the industry is built presupposes the idea that software is expensive to write and cheap to run, and LLMs undermine both of these. So it makes it LLMs allow writing shitty software to be significantly cheaper, not necessarily good software, but good enough in certain contexts. And also it means that there's certain software now that isn't plain old computing that can be run cheaply. It's relatively expensive marginal cost.

(00:11:49):
And so if you're going to do a consumer startup, it can't be based on advertising. It's just too expensive. Advertising cannot clear the inference costs even with inference costs declining. So I think the way to me, a disruptive technology changes tons of stuff, all these assumptions you didn't even realize you were making because you didn't realize it could be any different.

(00:12:07):
Imagine if you were locked in a room for your entire career, no windows, and you have all these experiences. You're going all this know how. You're getting this sense of how things work, what will happen. And then imagine that room tilts on its axis by five degrees. Everything looks roughly the same, and yet now the dynamics of the force of gravity is pulling in a different direction than it was before. You didn't even think about the force of gravity before because it was so omnipresent. It never changed that it's just a blank in your head. And now gravity has changed effectively for your perspective and all kinds of intuition is now wrong. I put this thing on the table, it's going to stay there, and then it slides off and falls into the wall. All kinds of weird stuff will happen.

(00:12:44):
And I think LLMs to me feel like that. I can't tell you the number of people who are... At some point at a year or two, someone came to me, they're like, "I just built a prototype, product that would've taken me three months. And I can believe it's going to start up." I was like, "How differentiated do you think that is?" Everybody can do that now. It changes the basis of competition. I think today I see a lot of folks using LLMs, and LLMs are like a squishy computer. We're used to computers doing exactly what we told them to do, which is not necessarily what we meant. And only some people have learned the skill of programming, the arcane magical incantations to make computers do exactly what you meant.

(00:13:24):
Now, LLMs can do all kinds of stuff. And they don't do exactly what you told them, but they do typically do roughly what you meant. I see all these places where people will build products and they'll say 80% of the time, 90% percent of the time, it's great. 5% of the time it punches the user in the face and they're like, "Oh, we're going to reduce the number of times it punches us in the face." It's like even if you get it down to 99% of the time, it's fine. If it punches in the face, that's not a viable product. And so how do you design your products assuming that this thing will be squishy and not fully accurate and fully work?

(00:13:53):
People use these things a lot as oracles. "I'm going to have it. I'm going to formulate the answer and it's going to be a fully fledged answer." And of course, strawberry has been really stabbed at. Gotten a chance to play with it. They are getting better at some of these kinds of behaviors at great expense. But in a lot of cases, I instead would rather say, "How can you take LLMs for granted? How can you assume that you now have this magical duct tape? Don't assume it's going to solve all your problems. Don't assume it's going to do autonomously be able to give high quality results of every case. But what can you now build now that you have magical duct tape?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:24):
You're a product manager for most of your career. Now, you're a founder. I'm curious what your advice would be to product managers and people building products in terms of what skills they should lean into, what you think is going to be matter most. There's hard skills. There's soft skills. There's getting more technical. There's getting more product business-oriented. Just what do you think people should work on more and becomes more valuable and what do you think becomes less valuable from a product builder perspective?

Alex Komoroske (00:14:52):
I think in this early stage, we're in the community gardening phase, not the factory farming phase of this technology. And so I think what people need most is curiosity and play. You should be playing with these things and trying out different things and seeing what weird things are possible now. One of my favorite things, to be honest, right now, it's using AI is WebSim. WebSim is so weird. What a weird idea, like why? And then you play with it and you realize, "Oh, this is a thing that could only exist in a world where LLMs exist." And I think these kinds of odd, interesting, weird, provocative, generative things will be where a lot of the interesting patterns are found because right now we're so used to... If the playbook, if the cost structures have changed, the kinds of things are now possible, the playbook is wrong and we should throw it out or at least ignore it to some degree. So it will feel like we are navigating through a whole new industry that it has in the past.

(00:15:47):
Anytime that an industry gets really, really, really, really, really good at like vertical SaaS, we know how to execute the crap out of that. We know exactly what to do. It doesn't require that much. It requires consumption and execution velocity and all this. But vertical SaaS, I think, is not the right model of how you would attack a problem that is an AI native style problem. And I think that those are where all the interesting things will be. And again, I think a lot of the tactics that we're trying out at the beginning, they won't work. It'll turn out that they only work 95% of the time, and 5% of the time they punch you in the face or something. And that means that you have to be more adaptable and you have to assume that a scrappy thing will be more important.

(00:16:28):
One of the ways I put this is we've seen a vast reduction in the cost of distribution of information, and now we're seeing a reduction in the cost of information production. And most of it is slop. And so in this cacophony, how do you stand out? You stand out by having good taste. I think taste is the most important thing. You have a perspective that is different from the background noise, different from the average and that people find compelling. How do you find your own taste and how do you lean into that taste is, I think, much more important than just generically executing in the way that everybody else could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):
There's so many threads I want to follow here, but maybe on just this last one, when you say taste, what do you mean by that? What should people think when they're like, "Okay, I got to work in my taste"?

Alex Komoroske (00:17:09):
Taste, one way of looking at this is differentiate from what the LLM would've written if given the same prompt. How different, how distinctive is what you have to say. And I think so much in large industry, in large organizations is about fitting into the role. How can you be a better and more efficient cog in that particular kind of machine? And I think in this new world, what you want to do is how can I become the best version of myself? How can I lean into the things that I have an interesting perspective on that make me different? Those are the kinds of things. And now of course, if you lean into something and you're doing something out there and nobody resonates with it, then it doesn't count. Good taste is something that is individual and also compelling to others. And so find what things you say that resonate with other people and lean into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
I love that. Back to the WebSim example, we're going to link to this, but definitely play with WebSim. I was interviewing Dylan Field at Figma Config and this was his... Asked him like, "What's the number one thing you think people are going to get more excited about in the future that you're playing with now?" Because he's really good at identifying things that are going to be bigger in the future, and that was his choice. And it's very hard to understand exactly what it is if you just go there. But basically it's like you type a URL and it invents what that website is using just AI LLMs.

Alex Komoroske (00:18:22):
That's insane, as in. And you can get it to do, you realize as you play with it more, you can get it to do all kinds of specific things and you can steer it based on the way it uses the context of the last few pages. It creates a coherent world that's coherent with the things that you have recently seen, because you can steer it directly and you can watch fascinating people. They'll cover all kinds of wacky little techniques to get to generate, like generate a game for your kid that's on a specific type. You can do all kinds of stuff. And I'm not saying necessarily WebSim to me is a disruptive thing. Things that look alien and weird and yet are compelling, those are what we should be paying more attention to as opposed to take an existing playbook and slap something on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
I love that. Another point that I saw you make about AI and the way it's different from other things we've done is most of the tools that we adopt in the workplace are collaborative where it helps your team be better, helps you collaborate better, and AI is the opposite. It makes you individually better. Can you talk about that insight?

Alex Komoroske (00:19:18):
100%. I think this is one of the reasons is that the question right now of, okay, everyone's talking about AI and yet nobody's doing... There's no interesting breakout success obviously other than OpenAI and Anthropic obviously. So is there any value being created? I think it's entirely possible. And Ethan Malik who's a good friend, who has an amazing blog who's absolutely worth reading, has pointed out, too, that this is a thing that make individuals better in a way they might not want to tell their manager about. I can now do my job twice as fast. And if the organization sees that, they might go, "Wait a second. We should pay you half this much." They're like, "What if we get rid of some extra people or something?"

(00:19:56):
And so if this stuff is magical duct tape, it's very hard to make scaled, repeatable, large scale things out of it. It's very easy to do rig the shit out of anything. And so you'll see it being used in the small in a way that's almost entirely below the level of awareness of the seeing at the organization. The organization almost won't see it or sense it, and yet it could be adding significant value or just being used quite heavily. And I think this is one of the things that makes it if everything is happening in the long tail of usage, then you could conclude, "Oh, it's not being used for anything in the industry," but it's being used all over the place. I talked to Claude 20 times a day. I just have long conversations with it. I have tons of projects loaded up with all kinds of contexts on different topics, and I literally could not do the job I do now without having a conversation partner like Claude.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:48):
Let me follow that thread real quick because a lot of people are like, "Okay," people keep telling me, "Play with AI. Use ChatGPT." Sometimes it's hard to see exactly what they can do with it. Can you give one example of how you found it really helpful or how you use Claude or another tool in your day-to-day?

Alex Komoroske (00:21:02):
I use it to think through problems. And so like when I'm trying to name a concept or get a handle on a few different ways of looking at something, just saying, "Here's what's in my brain about this topic right now. Here's some relevant context." I have a number of projects that just stuff as much of the Bits and Bobs into the context as I can, which is very helpful. And I just say, "Just play with it. Just give me 10 examples of that thing," or then, "Critique these ones," or, "It feels like this one's the best one for me. What works about this? Why is this one the best?" Or, "I want to work at an angle now that has something about know Helen Nissenbaum's concept of contextual integrity. How would I layer that in?" It's just think of it as having a extremely well-read but slightly naive friend who is will never make you feel dumb and is willing to engage you in any particular topic you want to go down.

(00:21:49):
So when you talk to an expert like a lawyer or a doctor or something, you know that that time is extremely valuable. You have a very small slice of time, and so there's tons of questions you don't even bother to ask. "That's a dumb question. I'm not going to spend $1,000 to answer that question." Whereas if you can have that conversation, now this is not saying use it for legal advice, but it can allow you to explore through a problem domain and then later check it with experts and say, "I believe this is a coherent outcome or a thing that should happen." And they can go, "Oh yeah, that works." So I use LLMs to help me. It's like getting a, it's like an electric bike for idea spaces. You can just cover so much more ground so much more quickly in them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:26):
I love that metaphor because it builds on Steve Jobs's that computers are a bicycle for the mind. And that's really a beautiful way of thinking about it, that LLMs are like the electric bicycle for the mind.

Alex Komoroske (00:22:37):
I don't think if that's someone else's, the...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
Oh, okay.

Alex Komoroske (00:22:39):
I don't know where it came from. Part of my job is a collector of ideas, and so I try to put myself in the most interesting information streams with interesting people that I've found to have taste, have a perspective on something. Maybe I disagree with it, but they definitely have a coherent idea. And then I just allow myself to like, "Oh, that's a really good idea and let me build on that or let me..." I don't even know where that particular one came, but I'm 95% sure that somebody else said that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):
I want to get to this idea of gardening versus building that is central to a lot of the way you think about it. But before we get there, I want to touch on another bit and bob that I love that you come back to occasionally, which is this idea of organizational kayfabe. Talk about what this idea of kayfabe is on its own and then how this applies to organizations in your experience.

Alex Komoroske (00:23:26):
One thing I should flag before I dive into any this stuff, sometimes when people hear me talk about how organizations work and systems, they think I'm being cynical. And I want to be very clear, I'm hyper-optimistic and I also believe that one of the moral precepts is how do you maximize the agency of real humans as ends in and of themselves? And so sometimes when I get excited about this, people go, "Wow, that is so cynical." No, I'm just trying to describe the system as it actually exists. Once we know how it exists, we can figure out how to make it do great things and how we as members of this system can tweak and nudge it.

(00:23:56):
So I just want to flag that before I dive into this. I have this slime mold deck which has gotten a ton of traction over the years, and part of the reason for that is because it feels like people tell me it feels like they think they're crazy and it feels like giving a big hug saying, "You are not crazy. Here's why this thing shows up." And once you acknowledge it, it feels like a bummer to acknowledge it, but once you do, now there's all kinds of options that pop up. "Oh, given that this thing is way more expensive than it looks, I can now do this instead. That one's 10 times cheaper. These two options, this one is way cheaper, way more likely to succeed." So once you see these forces, you see them more clearly.

(00:24:28):
So kayfabe is I think a lens that's useful to understand how organizations actually work. Kayfabe is a word that comes, I believe is a carny word that is used and applied to professional wrestling and it means a thing that everybody knows is fake and yet everybody acts like is real. And I think it's one of the defining forces within an organization, any organization. So kayfabe in the small is optimism, enthusiasm. When someone says, "We're going to do this thing," you say, "Yeah, we're going to do that," even if I think this isn't going to work. If you say, "I don't think this think is going to work," everyone loses hope and it definitely doesn't work. So having a little bit of this is extremely valuable. It's the lubricant that allows organizations to believe they can do something and to attempt to do it.

(00:25:09):
The problem that you get is as organizations get larger, imagine you are five levels down or something and you have this project you're working on and you're trying to give a status update to be rolled up to leadership. And it's currently a yellow, and your manager asks it and you know it's not going to be presented to leadership and enrolled up until next week. "It's yellow, but I've got my arms around the problem. I know how to fix it. I'm going to go talk to Sarah. I think we have a solution. By the time this is reported up the chain, it's going to be green." So if I make it yellow, there's a non-trivial chance that someone's going to swoop down and say, "Well, what's going on? We have a review," and it will be way harder to fix, so I'm just going to... A little white lie.

(00:25:46):
This is a totally reasonable thing to do. It's a self-defensive thing to do. And it's probably the right thing for the organization too. The problem is this happens up multiple layers and it compounds. So then your layer above you does the same, and the same, and the same, and levels up you can be many orders of magnitude off of the ground truth. And so the kayfabe, the thing that everyone pretends to believe is true, is obviously incorrect. And the dangerous part about this is it can lead you to make very bad decisions. And if you as someone who sees this can see that wait a second, the official strategy is definitely not going to work, you're like, "I got to tell somebody. We're doing work that's going in a bad direction. It's not going to work." And you go and say, "I think that it's actually not going to work for these reasons."

(00:26:27):
And what someone will say to you, this happens by the way, I'm not substituting any particular organization, this happens literally in all organizations to some degree, is the senior person will say, "Alex, I agree with you. It's not perfect, but if you hit the ground truth button, if you share that and everybody, the whole thing will shatter and we can't do anything. And so help me fix it. Don't say the ground truth. Just help nudge it and fix it." That's a good point. Okay, so you help working on it and then you realize a month later, wait a second, it's getting worse. We're doing things that's not good for the company. It's not creating user value. It's not good for the employees. They're burning out. It's just not good for anybody and it's getting worse. And so if you think you're going to go and hit the ground truth button, before you do, you'll be flying tackled to the ground by somebody and stabbed in the dark because you will destroy everything.

(00:27:13):
And so it becomes correct to hold onto this idea of if you acknowledge the kayfabe is false, then you are in danger of getting knocked out of the game. And so how do you do good things despite the fact that you're pulled in two different directions? And this increasingly in the limit, it can be good to a point where the easiest way is if I do, if I hold on this idea, we might create significant value for the company. If I let go of this idea, I die. So the easiest way to maintain this split-brain thing is to just turn this part off and just earnestly believe the kayfabe. This has been organizations become zombies, and anyone individually you talk to behind the scenes will agree yes, it could not possibly work. That turns out that these things work this way, and yet the entire organization lumbers on.

(00:27:56):
And this is a death state for large organizations. It happens all over the place in any number of different conditions, and this is one of the reasons it shows up. And I think acknowledging that is an important way to help navigate and still make good grounded things happen. How can you allow disconfirming evidence to show up that doesn't kill you, that helps make you stronger? And if it all has to come in one massive moment that could ruin everything, then you aren't going to hear it. And then it will build up and build up and build up and build up into a super critical state that could shatter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:27):
I was just listening to a couple podcasts, and a thread that came up in a number of them is some of the most successful leaders, their instruction to their reports is, "As soon as there's bad news, I need to know as soon as possible. Do not shield me. I just want to know all the bad news as soon as possible." Feels like that's one solution to what you're describing.

Alex Komoroske (00:28:44):
Disconfirming evidence hurts, and so you won't realize it because it hurts at any given moment. It's like, "Ugh, it's a distraction. We're just trying to get this thing done." And so it comes from a good place to not get it, but if you're busy, that's one of the reason you need to take a step back. We take a step back, you're a little bit calmer. You can absorb this as confirming evidence. It doesn't feel like an existential threat. It's really easy to get surrounded. If you are very powerful, you will find all the confirming evidence you need. And if it doesn't exist, it will be created for you without your knowledge.

(00:29:12):
And so this is one of the reasons that large companies are radically different than smaller companies. And one of the traps that you can get into of not realizing this dynamic is happening, and you can make very bad decisions if you don't understand that it's inherently what's happening because they're all, "Oh, we'll have some bad actors." No, no, no. If people don't play this game, this game is emergent. It shows up even though everybody hates it. And if you don't play the game, you are knocked out of the game. The underlying dynamic that must be true in any organization on a fundamental basis is you can't make your boss look dumb because if you do, they're the person who decides, "Oh, this person's not performing," or whatever. And that one little asymmetry, that one little fact, in most cases it does not matter. That one little asymmetry is what leads to the systemic compounding thing where you get these really weird dysfunctional emergent things that everybody hates, nobody wants, and yet nobody is in the position to change per se.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):
I love your caveat at the beginning that continues to resonate in my head as you say this. You're not cynical about, "This sucks." It's more, "Here's what I'm observing. We need to think about ways to get around this."

Alex Komoroske (00:30:16):
Yeah. Because I think so much pain and misery is caused by us being not acknowledging these fundamental, inescapable things. It's almost impossible. Entropy is one of those things. Entropy emerges because there's more ways to go away from a point than towards a point. It fundamentally must be true in really any universe you can possibly imagine. And so if you're going to fight entropy, you're going to lose at a certain point. It's like if you are aware of these things, you can find subsets of ideas that do work despite these challenges. And that's some of the stuff, the tactics I advise are often things that look playful. They look unserious. They look like, "Oh, you're saying you don't know the answer?" No, I'm admitting I don't know the answer.

(00:30:55):
And I'm saying it doesn't matter if I don't know the answer because this thing, this very small seed I am planting is so cheap that yes, I can't tell you for sure this will work, but I could tell you there is a chance that it'll work. And the downside of this is basically the opportunity cost of planting the seed in this one moment, and the person who's planting it enjoys planting it so that an opportunity cost really isn't that much because they get energy from doing it. So who cares? Plant a bunch of these suckers. If one of these grows into an oak tree, that's great. Don't try to analyze beforehand which seed is going to turn into an oak tree. If it's super simple to plant the seeds, then plant the seeds. And if it starts growing, then keep watering it. That's it. That's the thing.

(00:31:30):
And people sometimes will see this as like, I've been called in my list before because they said, "Well, you're saying that you don't know the answer to the thing." It's like no, I'm saying I don't have to know the answer to the thing. If on a systemic basis I let these ideas and then you respond to the ones that are working that are viable, it doesn't really matter if you didn't know ahead of time which ones were going to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
It's a great segue to talking about this core idea that again informs a lot of the way you think, which is this idea of building versus gardening, the magic of acorns. Talk about this general idea and then I want to follow some threads.

Alex Komoroske (00:32:02):
So much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like, "I have a plan, I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen." And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. And so what I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. So it's like a lead by gardening vibe. I don't try to pick the things in the system. I try to work with what I've actually got and I try to lean in on the ones that turn, I think are going in the direction that I believe is valuable based on constantly seeking disconfirming evidence.

(00:32:44):
And if you do this properly, it looks like magic. It looks like a thing. It looks like getting lucky because what you're doing is you're farming for miracles. And so on a systemic basis, I can't tell you which of these things will work, but I can tell you there's a very high likelihood that one of these will work in a way that is interesting and transformative. And so if you're looking and finding these seeds that have the compounding potential of if they work, they would start working at an accelerating rate, then you don't have to know ahead of time. To me this is, I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get building products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:26):
Is there an example that you can give from either from something you worked on or something someone worked on that came or true miss? Because I think people hearing this might be like, "But I got to ship stuff. I got to hit some goals. I don't have time to sit around and garden and plant seeds. I got to actually build."

Alex Komoroske (00:33:41):
If there's an ecosystem approach, if there's something that if it works, it'll be self-accelerating. So okay, what you're going to do this thing, we aren't entirely sure what's going to work, but if a developer writes a thing and somebody uses it, it'll attract more developers, more users, and then this would grow on its own. Then and it's cheap to do the little example of the thing. It's cheap to build a little open source, tinker the little thing and just put it there. And if nobody uses it, it's fine. It was fun to build. It took you three hours. It's fine. If someone does use it, then you just invest in incremental bit of unit each time that you find a signal that somebody is finding it useful and then you stop if you ever cease getting that information.

(00:34:16):
So I would use this. Anything that is shaped like an ecosystem that has some kind of network effect, and many things have network effects, have some kind of compounding loop. Compounding loops are not rare. They are, "Look." It's like truffle hunting. You have to know what you're looking for and find the dynamics of a thing that if it worked would work at an accelerating rate. Lots and lots and lots of things intrinsically have this shape. Anything with a network effect, anything where the power goes up with a number of users, but it shows up in all kinds of problems that we don't normally apply it to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:47):
Along the same lines, you also advise people to think more emergence-oriented versus top-down, kind of what you were just saying. But I think that's another really interesting way of thinking about the same idea, create opportunities for emergence, bottom-up versus top-down control. You just chat about that.

Alex Komoroske (00:35:03):
100%. I think the emergence is one of the most powerful forces if you know how to marshal it and you know how to work with it. And the only thing that's hard about it in my opinion is you're going to look like you aren't very serious. You're going to look like a weirdo. You're going to look like a cook. And one of the downsides, if you're working on something and you're doing the normal top-down approach where you make the plan, you execute the plan, even if the plan turns out to not be useful, you produce a thing and nothing interesting happens, no one can say you didn't work hard. But if you try doing this designing for emergence and something amazing happens, even once it happens, people go, "Ah, it's luck. Where was the miraculous moment, the heroic moment where you made that happen? So therefore you had nothing to do with it."

(00:35:42):
And this was the biggest unlock in my career actually was when I stopped my guts. I was promoted to director at Google. I was like, "Cool, I never want to be promoted inside of a large organization ever again." And the freedom to now do the highest impact work, even if I can't make it legible to the organization, was so powerful and I was able to 10X my impact for the organization because I didn't have to worry about making it measurable specifically in a way that would show individual work effort. And I think that's the hardest part. And you have to have, typically what I would advise for PMs, my approach at Google was 70% of my effort and my team's effort should go on things that everybody acknowledges are important and useful and create value. Maybe it's boring, linear value, but some kind of value. You're trying to minimize the chance that any other person in a company will say, "What does that team do anyway?"

(00:36:32):
This, if someone says this about your team, your team is on the verge of death. And so you're trying to minimize the chance that anybody wants to say that or thinks that it's appropriate to say that by clearly and unambiguously adding value. You're not saying this is the best team in the entire world, but clearly they're doing something useful. They're executing well. They're working hard. And of course that team should exist. Think about it, of course they should. But now once you do this, you have 30% of your extra time that you can plant all these seeds.

(00:36:55):
You can find interesting little things where maybe a junior PM on the team has an idea you think it's kind of silly, but they're really into it. And the there is this thing, it could work out great actually. If you tweak it like this, there is a potential. I could see how that could work. If that PM is going to work on that anyway, they want to do it anyway. Instead of saying, "No, no, no, we don't have time for that. Be a little bit more productive over here," say, "Go for it. Here's my concerns. I imagine this part might not work, but this part is really cool right here." And then if it doesn't work, then they've stretched their agency. They've executed. They've exercised their agency. They've learned. They've gotten stronger. They've grown. It has the upside if it turns out to actually work. And worst case scenario, the opportunity cost to doing the thing that helped them grow and they learn and they liked. So I don't know. Don't try to force it. Don't try to stop it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):
That's a really good example of actually how to go about doing that on your team. The way I've always thought about this is the visual I share with people is like, you want to create cover fire for your team where your team's just hitting goals, moving metrics, and then while with that cover fire, you're building the doomsday bomb inside, protected where no one's going to come and stop you.

Alex Komoroske (00:37:58):
Yeah, because one of the hardest parts about an acorn when you plant it is making sure a squirrel doesn't dig that fucker up. There's so many things that can destroy it, and just keeping it, allowing it some space and allowing it some time is the most important thing. And it's challenging to do, but that's why it's important as a leader to have enough credibility in the organization that people can see that you are doing useful work to give you the space, to give your team the space to do this truly great work. If you want to get your team to do good work, there's a million different paths to do that. If you want to get your team to do great work, there's no shortcut other than to have an extremely high-trust environment where people lean into their superpowers in a way that adds up to something greater than some of its parts. That takes time. It takes effort. It's very difficult to make legible up to the rest of the organization, but that is where great things come from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:46):
It reminds me of something Ed Catmull shared in Creativity, Inc., this idea of the ugly baby, that every new idea is an ugly baby and nobody wants this ugly baby. Everyone's just like, "Get this out of here," because every new idea is bad initially.

Alex Komoroske (00:39:00):
Yeah, it sucks. They're just like this ugly thing that barely works or... But this is why what I try to do is I try to see the greatness, the seeds of greatness in everything. Everyone and everything around me, I look for, I try to find and see, man, what is the most compelling part of this? And let me lean into that. And so one of the things I try to do when I meet with people, when I mentor them, I try with it within the first session or two, whenever I can get a hypothesis, I say, "I think your superpower is..." And I describe to them what I think I can see them being truly exceptional at.

(00:39:31):
And sometimes I get it wrong, especially if I try to do it earlier, but when people feel very seen and they feel acknowledged for that, they now are willing, they're going to stretch farther and they're going to respond to nudging feedback even better because they know that you're not trying to tell them be different. You're trying to tell them be more, and you now the nudges will feel less like a stop energy and more like someone who gets me and can help me grow even more. And you can get some amazing things out of people when you just treat them with the respect. I assume that everyone I talk to, everyone I talk to is interesting, has seeds of greatness in them, even if they don't recognize necessarily where they are.

(00:40:08):
Someone described to me actually this morning in one of my little dirt clubs I run about they help facilitate about treat everybody like the Buddha. I think is I'm messing this up, but this notion of imagine everyone you talk to is the Buddha, in a Buddhist mindset, and how do you see and find those seeds of greatness and treat everyone with respect intrinsically as an end of themselves. This is one of those things that you do to be a compassionate human. It's also, I believe, a way to maximize the amount of value, direct and indirect value, that's created. So it's one of those win-win-win-win-wins where just it's the right thing to do as a person and a member of society, and it's also the thing that can create a lot of business value and create real value in the world.

Coming back to a phrase that you used earlier, slime molds, I want to spend a little time here. So interestingly enough, the first time I heard about you and what got me interested in your stuff is I did a newsletter post with the company Perplexity about how they build product. And as they were describing how they organized their team, the co-founders described they organized like slime mold, and he linked to your deck about slime molds and I was like, "What the heck is this?" Can you just briefly describe what you mean when you talk about slime molds and how slime molds are related to the way companies are organized and how they should think of the organization?

Alex Komoroske (00:42:32):
Yeah. The main thesis of the slime mold deck is that the core dynamic that makes organizations hard to navigate as they get larger, even if you assume everyone is actively good at what they do, actively collaborative and actively hardworking, is this emergent force or coordination of finding the subset of projects to work on when everyone's super busy that everyone agrees and commits to and actually works on together. And finding this coordination cost grows with the square of the number of people who are working on that thing. And so what companies typically try to do is fight this or ignore that it exists.

(00:43:06):
If you're going to fight it, the one way to look at this is think of a company like a vehicle. When the company is very small, you can drive it, you can steer it like a sports car. As a founder, you are allowed to steer. Everyone acknowledges you are allowed to steer. They're never, "Why is he steering it that way?" So you, a founder, can help navigate an organization around an obstacle the organization cannot see or comprehend itself. The problem is as you steer, as you grow into the size, your organization goes from a sports car and you grow into the size of a big rig, if you drive a big rig like a sports car, you're going to be a danger to yourself and others on the road and you're going to grind the engine. And so you got to drive the car that you actually have.

(00:43:41):
So what I see a lot of things happen in large organizations, that people are just trying to ignore this fact. And when you drive, by the way, a car, your vehicle, like a big rig, when it is a big rig, people go, "Oh, it means to go slow." No, no, no. It means pivot less. It means have a little bit more... Be more intentional about the times that you adjust the steering, invest more in program management, invest more in processes, give a little bit more slack in the planning process to absorb any kind of surprising things that you can still all reach the product launch at the same time.

(00:44:13):
The other option you can do is you can split your thing up into a series a swarm of sports cars, individual sports cars. And the downside of this, you'll get the autonomy and strengths of the bottom-up, the downside is other people will externally will look at it and go, "Well, that team and that team clearly didn't talk." You'll say, "Yep, yep." You have to decide how bad that is for you. Apple has chosen the former. It's very important to them to have the illusion of perfect coherence in their products. It worked very well for them. They executed marvelously. And if you also picked the exact opposite thing, everyone else is like, "Yeah. There are like 15 different ways of doing everything. They clearly don't talk to each other." But it allows the overall swarm of the AWS product suite to be very powerful and anti-fragile or whatever you want to say.

(00:44:52):
And so slime molds, I think, is acknowledging that organizations are, especially ones that focus on autonomy and agency of their individual employees, which is a lot of tech companies, they are more like slime molds than we realize. And if you fight that fact, you're going to have a bad time. And if you embrace it, then you can start realizing slime molds are actually kind of amazing. They can find solutions to problems you didn't even know you were searching for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
Alex, you have the best metaphors. I don't know how you do this, but they're so evocative and correct.

Alex Komoroske (00:45:21):
I can tell you that the process I do if you're into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):
Please. That would be incredible.

Alex Komoroske (00:45:25):
I think by talking, I'm an external processor, I literally can't think if I'm not talking. And so I make sure I have as many interesting meetings as I can, and that's where I discover what I think, by talking to people. And the test is if I say a frame, something that the person goes, "Ooh," or like, "Ooh," they go, "Aha," that's a win. That's a mark that's a good one. You're just randomly casting about. I find one. And then if a different person also has a similar response, if a person in sales and a person in engineering both find the same idea interesting, that's a very good sign that lots of people will find it interesting, how diverse in terms of background skill sets, perspectives are the people who resonate with the thing you're saying.

(00:46:08):
The intuition of this is if you find in a social network, you want to see what's going to go viral, if something is shared and it's shared within, so the people who are at the beginning are all highly densely interconnected in the social graph, then the implied ceiling is relatively small. You only know it works with that audience. But if it's people that are very different subclass and very little overlap, they both find it interesting, that implies a much larger max audience. So you're looking for ideas that resonate with the diversity of people. And then once you find them, each time you get something like that, you invest a little more time in it and you think a little bit more about framing it the next time.

(00:46:42):
I haven't done this during this chat, but in most conversations, you'll see me as I'm talking writing down stuff like, "Ooh, that was the best formulation of that one so far." And so you keep on coming back to it. You keep on tightening it and seeing how, watching how it's responding and referring with different people through like, "Where do you get these from?" It's like I got thousands and thousands and thousands of little examples or metaphors or whatever that's sick.

(00:47:03):
One of the benefits of metaphorical thinking is you connect nine of the 10 dots and you invite the listener to engage with the argument to connect that last dot. This allows you by the way to say very controversial things, because if you say connect all the 10 dots and it's like, "Oh, that's the official strategy," then you are instantly a dangerous thing. Whereas if you leave one dot unconnected, people can go connect the dot and go, "Oh my god, I think that applies to us." You're like, "Oh my god, what?" "Yes, that's why I picked that." But to counteract this because now it's less obvious to people that's correct, you have to make the metaphor evocative and interesting.

(00:47:39):
One of the reasons that slime mold deck got so much traction is partially because slime is gross, it's bad, and yet it's talking about why slime is good. And so that has this instantly subversive thing. I only know this after the fact of trying to figure out why did that deck get so much attention of all the things I've written.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
It also is all emojis basically, which is not how you often read a deck. It's very beautifully made. I love that you've been talking about the way you think and come up with ideas is by talking to people and having conversations. We also talked about how you write in this Bits and Bobs approach. I asked someone that you worked with at Stripe what to ask you, and she said to ask you about strategy salons, which feels like a good avenue for this sort of thing. Can you talk about what these are and how you set these up?

Alex Komoroske (00:48:26):
So these I also call now nerd clubs, and these are my secret weapon. And I have a blog post. I started writing right before my second kid was born, and then he was born three weeks early and I just lost the plot and now it's like a 40-page draft of a thing that I'll probably never finish. But I've used this tactic. I discovered it many years ago as they strengthen some of the techniques I'd used in open source community organizing. And the situation was I was just joining a new team at Google. I've been there for many years, and there was at the time 12 different groups working in different aspects of this overall problem domain. And in classic Google fashion, they added up to significantly less than the sum of their parts, as in not like, "Oh, we'll see which one works," but, "These two things directly undermine each other. If you execute both of these strategies, neither can work." And I knew that if you try to do pairwise executive reviews on this very complex, ambiguous, open-ended problem, you would get really expensive pageantry that would obscure more than clarified.

(00:49:17):
So what I did was I created a secret group that I called Navel Gazers was the original one, and I wanted people when they hear about it, I want people to go, "That will be a club for nerds." They're like, "Yeah, do you want in?" And so this means that only people who intrinsically want to be in it for its own sake come in. So you get only a positive "yes, and" kind of energy. So then within these groups, you say, you set the norms very explicitly and say, "This is a collaborative debate environment. This is only 'yes, and'." If somebody says a thing in this group that is optional and secret and completely off the side of anything that matters, if they say something that you think is an actively dumb idea, you are free to not engage. Just leave it. That's fine. Because nothing's going to happen. We're deciding anything interesting or important here.

(00:49:57):
And if you want to engage and you don't like it, a productive way of doing that is saying, "Oh, that's so interesting. I would never would've thought to apply that lens. I typically would apply this lens to that kind of problem. I wonder if that applies here." And by saying, "I wonder," you make it about you, not them. And so that person can choose if that's an interesting thing to build on or not. This sounds by the way very non-rigorous feel like, "Ah, how can you possibly get rigorous thinking in the 'yes, and'?" It turns out there's limited amounts of time and so people will choose to build on the things they find most interesting. This is interesting things are surprising and potentially valuable. And so if lots of different people in the group are building on the same idea, that's a good sign there is something very interesting going on.

(00:50:35):
The third thing you do is you dribble in new perspectives. Every one to three a week, if you put in lots of new perspectives, once the norms can all scramble, if you have one in five people who all have a very particular kind of personality can mess up the norms, and so you're trying to minimize the chance you add a jerk. It takes one person to poop a party and go, "What are we even doing here?" You want to minimize the chance that happens. But second or thirdly and more importantly, you want to have as people with as different perspective as possible added into the group. And so this is what Ken Stanley might call, for example, novelty search. You're novelty-searching through the different perspectives in the overall thing.

(00:51:10):
When you do this properly, you get something magical. You get a group that people find intrinsically valuable for its own sake and just enjoy participating in and find meaning in, that also stochastically spins off changing insights for the surrounding context because you're searching through these ideas in a low stakes environment where the ideas that lots people build on, they go, "Oh, you should write that down." And this is like an idea lab, what everyone will call an idea lab. And this creates amazingly interesting insights. You just can't force it to do anything. It has to be a bottom-up and emergent, which means if you try to steer it towards an outcome, it won't go. But if you do these, they are amazing places to riff and to share ideas and half-formed ideas. And this is anywhere I go, I terraform the culture around me and create these, because I need it as a place to experiment and try out different half-formed ideas and build on them and be inspired by other people.

(00:52:03):
And that is one of my secrets, strategy secrets that I've been doing now for probably 10 years ago is when the first one started. And there's now I can count eight or nine of I've started over the years. Some of them emerged. So many of them are still at Google. And I think it's like they're just wondrous environments that I think create a lot of value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:21):
And I love it's a perfect example of your approach of emergent properties, letting things emerge versus a top-down, "Here's what we're doing and here's what we're talking about here." If someone wanted to set this up within their company or within friends, any advice? What are some constraints and ways of setting it up for success?

Alex Komoroske (00:52:37):
Communities are all about momentum. You want to have a space too small, a time too short. If you have a big cabinet space of a lot of people in it and no one's talking, people go, "I guess this is the place where we don't talk," for whatever reason. So what you're doing is you want the smallest seed of people that you know are going to be actively engaged. So maybe there's four of you that already talk over lunch and you talk about whatever topic and it's always really interesting and generative. Cool, get that group together and do a thing. And then incrementally add people who you think are going to like that already as it currently exists. And then you need to feed it so you want to make sure that it never dies.

(00:53:09):
And a community with no people talking is definitely dead. A community with one person talking is already dead. You don't realize it yet. And so you're trying to maximize the chance that there's an interesting conversation even when you as the facilitator are not there. This takes some active policing by the... Like a garden has a gardener, there's somebody pruning back and saying, "Hey Jeff, just so you know, I think that came out a little bit strong to Sarah's idea and maybe next time add 'I wonder' to the front of that statement," or whatever.

(00:53:35):
The other thing that you do is when people reach out to you and ping you, they go, "Hey, let's think about this thing," and you go, "That's a really interesting idea. You should share that in the group." And then they do. And then you engage in the group and say, "That was really interesting," little emoji response. And people who didn't watch the interaction assume that Sarah just decided proactively to stick her neck out and share that and that it worked. And so this becomes a self-sustaining norm in the community. And it's not a secret. It's not if someone asks, "Yeah, I told Sarah to share that," but people watching don't realize that. And so it becomes a place that people do take risks and feel comfortable sharing.

(00:54:07):
The other thing you do is once a week or so, you want to make sure that you never propose something in the group that people go, "Eh." You always want to do a thing people go, "Yeah." So what you do is you see that if you're talking to other people, you say, "I wonder if we should have a live conversation every so often, right?" The chats were so fun, but it goes, "Would you come if I did one?" "Oh yeah, I would." "Okay, great." So now I say, "Hey, a few of us are talking. We're just going to do an experiment. We're going to have an hour-long conversation over lunch on Wednesday. Anyone in the group is free to come."

(00:54:33):
 And then what you do is you make sure it always has quorum because if it doesn't have quorum, then the thing, it looks like the community's dead. And then what you do is you send FOMO stuff afterwards. So you say, "Here's my notes from the thing," or, "Thanks Sarah, Jeff," blah, blah, blah, blah, "or an amazing conversation. I thought the insight about," blah blah blah, "was so ridiculously amazing." So you want people who were in the group who didn't come to feel like they missed out and to come to the next one.

(00:54:57):
And so you're constantly creating these kinds of vibes to how to do it. You can't do it if you don't have somebody with a lot of energy. I'm typically the seed crystal for a lot of the groups I'm in to start them off because I have a lot of energy, and I like, anything that people have to say that I think is open-minded or interesting, I like building on and "yes, and"-ing and that kind of gives the foundation that it can grow. But look for the people who already roughly want it. Don't try to convince somebody who doesn't want it to want it. They will not. They will ruin the whole thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:30):
I just love this playbook for starting to build a little bit of community within a company. Have you written about this by the way? And if not, you should write a whole post about this.

Alex Komoroske (00:55:37):
I have. It's a long essay and it's just not, you can see it in Bits and Bobs. If you gave the Bits and Bobs to Claude and said, "Please write a thing about nerd clubs and essay and the style," it would do it because there's a lot of the pieces are in there, it's just not factored out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:52):
I see you writing something down right now, which tells me you just articulated something in a new way that you want to say.

Alex Komoroske (00:55:52):
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:59):
You mentioned this idea of constraints of time, and it reminds me of something that you shared in one of your Bits and Bobs around productivity. You say that if you have two hours to do a five-minute task, the effort to do that is impossible and instead you should flip that. Can you talk about this insight and how to be a little more productive?

Alex Komoroske (00:56:15):
Yeah, I think a lot of the trick to productivity is to play yourself like a fiddle and figure out how you work and what gives you energy and set up your day to structure it that way. So I find every time you start a task, there's an activation energy, especially a task you don't really want to do. And then when you complete it, there's a boop. There's a little burst of energy. So if you do this properly, you can get small things that are extremely easy to knock out in 10 seconds of effort, and then you do one that takes 30 seconds of effort, and then you do one that takes a longer bit of effort. But if you give it too much space, it's harder to do. So you almost want to find, "Okay, listen, I got 10 minutes. I got to do this thing where I figure out how to add, do this thing in gusto that I've been putting off. Ten minutes should be enough time to do it and structure it. So okay, right now is the only time I have to do this, to do it."

(00:57:01):
And another trick is I use one of my original media messages actually, one of the original public ones is about always rules are better than sometimes rules for self-control. And so if you're going to diet, "I'm going to skip lunch every day." Like holy, you haven't full thought on that at some point like a day with a big executive review, "I really need to make sure I'm well-fed before I go into this review," or something. And now you've broken the streak and now it's over. Whereas if you say a thing you know can do, "I will not have a dessert unless it would be socially awkward for me to not eat it. For example, in a small environment where somebody made homemade dessert and all of us are eating it, I'm going to..." So very clear black and white rule that you can hold on forever.

(00:57:50):
So for example, since the pandemic started, I've done a Peloton workout every single day since the pandemic started.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:56):
Wow.

Alex Komoroske (00:57:56):
And now once I do start going back into the office, if I had to commute into the office, I would sometimes do a meditation to check the box for that. But if I'm not commuting and I'm not deathly sick, I've done a full workout since then. And the idea each day of is today the day of all the hundreds of days in this streak that is the worst or the hardest for me to do this thing? Is this the day? No, of course it's not. I will do it. And so that keeps you in this streak that makes it harder and harder to get out of it. And in some ways, of course you can torture yourself in an unproductive way like at a certain point maybe you should stop that streak, but I think those kinds of structuring help you get the things done you want to get done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):
It's like the Seinfeld trick of productivity where you just keep track of how many days in where you've done something essentially.

Alex Komoroske (00:58:45):
Yeah, exactly. And I think people don't give those kinds of tactics enough credit because there's lots of little social tricks to yourself and others. This is when you have other people who are depending on you for something and will know that you didn't do the thing, that were so much better. So just little tricks like this help you be wildly more productive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:02):
Actually, I want to go back a little bit. I'm curious what you wrote down when we were chatting earlier that you thought was a good articulation if you're able to share, if it's interesting,

Alex Komoroske (00:59:11):
I wrote down, and the reason I wrote it down is I've never... And by the way, I collect everything even once I think are maybe onto something. So I wrote down, "A community with zero people speaking is dead and a community with one person speaking doesn't yet realize it's dead," is what I wrote down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):
So fun. I love this practice that you have.

Alex Komoroske (00:59:28):
By the way, the reason I can do it, I can type insanely quickly. And in undergrad, I wrote my thesis on the emergent power dynamics in Wikipedia's user community and I did 150 hours of interviews with different editors in Wikipedia, and I transcribed them myself. And so I got really, really, really good at I can just pipe an idea straight into my fingertips and still listen to other stuff. So that's another superpower is I've just constantly, I'm able to capture it very, very quickly. I've written notes that are at least good enough for me to clean up within the next day or two into something that's more stable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):
Is there a way you built this other than... Was it just you did it and you had to do it and you just figured out how to move fast?

Alex Komoroske (01:00:08):
I just realized later that I could type really good, really fast. I could just pipe it straight through to my fingers and it worked. And, I don't know, I don't know if I hadn't written my thesis, would I have discovered that? I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):
I feel like everything you do is on super speed, the way you think, the write and get stuff done. There's a lot.

Alex Komoroske (01:00:30):
I just realized when-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:31):
... a lot of compute.

Alex Komoroske (01:00:32):
... when you're feeling productive, you're unstoppable. And so just how can you be in your flow state as much as possible? And there's things that absolutely completely grind me to a halt, and I just make sure I invest my time in situations that don't have that characteristic. So when I work on something that I believe could work and have a big impact, I can't stop. Sometimes I'll wake up at 4:00 in the morning as I'm typically an early riser and I'm just like, "I'll write this thing." The meeting starts at 7:00 and I just think there's an idea that's really cool here and I let myself lean into those kinds of when I have the moment.

(01:01:05):
I also find that often if I have an idea and I just have itching to write it down, if I can write down 30 minutes and get a very rough of it in one place, now it's easier to clean it up later. But that first act of creation, I do it whenever the muse hits because it's 10 million times if it's like, "Oh, write that idea down later," you keep on delaying it, delaying it, now it's a month later. "What was the idea? How did that work again?" It's gone. And so I just try to capture the interesting insights. It's like a butterfly collector. The butterflies are going by, I try to collect them and put them in my collection as quickly as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:38):
Or garden as one might describe it.

Alex Komoroske (01:01:40):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:43):
This touches on a quote I wanted to talk to you about. I think you described it as your life philosophy. "Do things that give you energy that you are proud of." Talk about that.

Alex Komoroske (01:01:54):
So to me, it's the combination of when you're doing something you believe in and that gives you energy, you are 10 times more productive. And you also, the effort that you are doing is its own reward. And so you are indefatigable on that topic and you go for much longer. So finding the substance of things that align with you that give you energy, then just it's like infinite energy. It's like they give an opportunity cost because it energizes you more than the opportunity cost of the time to go spend to other things.

(01:02:21):
And two, there are ways to give yourself energy, like for example, playing a video game, or there's any kind of mind-altering substance that might give you that like, "This gives me energy." Those are not things that I'm not saying do those. I'm saying what are the things that you'll look back and say, "I'm glad I did that. I'm proud that I did that." And if you take the perspective of a 10 years on looking back on each decision and thing that you're doing, and imagine seeing this decision played in front of 1,000 people whose opinion you care about, your family, your friends, your role models, would you be proud is a good sign of life that you're taking a broad enough perspective.

(01:02:55):
When you're busy and in the moment, it's so easy to say, "I just got to do this one thing that's probably not great to get this thing done. And once I do it, it's going to suck. But once I do it, it'll be fine." And then you find yourself doing it again and again and again and again and before you know it, you've lost who you want to be and you're now a husk of yourself. And so I think those two pieces lean into where you find energy, where you specifically find energy, your superpower, the thing that you intrinsically enjoy doing, and just make sure it's something that you are actively proud of and that helped make sure you don't take a bunch of shortcuts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):
Along those same lines, I think a lot of people have heard a version of this quote, which is, "New things that give you energy." So one, I love the additional piece of it is, "and that you're proud of." Two, you have another quote that I love that makes you think deeply about stuff, which is, "The secrets of life is things you've heard a million times already, you just weren't ready to hear them." Talk about that insight.

Alex Komoroske (01:03:53):
So this I call the Hallmark card fallacy, which is you discover at great effort some deep insight that resonates with you and makes you see the world differently, and you want to share it. Insights are naturally viral. You want to share them and you go tell someone, it's like, "Guys, guys, the point of life is the friends we made along the way." And people go, "That's from a Hallmark card, man." And to you, it is you now possess the knowledge, the emotional intelligence to understand why that phrase has been shared so many times. Before, you heard it when you weren't ready and now it becomes a trite, "Duh, everyone says that. That can't possibly be a meaningful statement."

(01:04:30):
The reason people keep on saying it is because it's meaningful. And so I think that having that space of recognizing it, that when you have these epiphanies that come from different leaps in vertical development or the ability to, when you stare into the abyss and make it through the other side, you realize and learn a bunch of amazing things that you want to pass on others, and it's just really hard to get them to find it.

(01:04:53):
I find that that's one of the reasons I try to write things that are or share ideas that are like little seeds that you can shoot into someone's brain even if the soil's not ready for it, it's rocky or craggy, at some point in the future, if something goes through there and opens up a crack, that's sitting there to grow into an idea. One of the things that makes me the happiest is when someone I've mentored years and the years in the past, they go search me out years later and say, "Alex, I just want to let you know, you probably don't even remember talking to me, but that Tuesday at the building, the no-name cafe or whatever, on Google campus, you said something I was frustrated to hear in the moment I didn't understand it. And I just want to tell you, thank you because I finally understand what you were trying to tell me. And I realized that that influenced me in the decisions." That to me is one of those meaningful things I can hear.

(01:05:41):
And so I just find that you can't force it before people are ready to hear certain topics.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:48):
Man, that must feel so good to hear those sorts of closing the loop on something long ago. The point you make about cliches that you've heard a million times actually finally feeling right and profound, I had this very experience. I did a psychedelic trip with some friends a while ago, and at the end of it I was just like, "Man, love is all you need. Love is all you need." I felt that so deeply through the experience and I was telling people, they're like, "Shut up."

Alex Komoroske (01:06:16):
You telling, oh, do you just do psychedelics? Yeah, it's funny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:19):
Yeah.

Alex Komoroske (01:06:19):
I have a lot of folks in my broader space who obviously have used it. So I never personally have myself, but I find there's various ways. The transcendent mindset is this feeling of being part of something much, much, much larger than yourself and losing your ego in this thing. There's different ways of doing it. Some people will find it in hiking and being out in the wilderness alone. Some people find it being at a concert and thousands of people perfectly in sync to this thing. Some people find it in religious experience. Some people find it using psychedelics and others to help get there. But a lot of it, it's that same just being willing to be in awe.

(01:06:53):
There's so many times that people feel the feeling of awe or wonder or curiosity is treated as a not very serious or childlike thing. And I just don't get that because that is how you are open to disconfirming evidence. It's how you see beyond the current limits of what you... Your ego gets hurt when you get disconfirming evidence. You don't want to hear it. And so you'll construct the world around yourself to not get that disconfirming evidence. But disconfirming evidence is what makes systems strong. It's what makes you strong. And so how do you put yourself in the situation to get that information and really receive it?

(01:07:28):
And part of it is just coming in terms of the fact of early in my career, someone called me kooky a bit. Oh, man. I must be embarrassed. I'm like, "Okay, fine. Yeah, I'm kooky, whatever." I'm totally at peace with the idea that some people track me as kooky and not particularly serious. I think people who watch the work that I do and the indirect impact it has realize that I'm doing something that is working even if they don't fully understand how it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:53):
To start to close our conversation, I want to throw out one more seed that might land with someone in the right time. You have this concept of the adjacent possible, which I think is a really powerful concept. And it's basically argues that a lot of people jump to big bold ideas, and instead the better approach is think about what's a constraint you have and lean into the constraints and use that as a guide. Can you just talk about this and how this might inform how people think about product and strategy?

Alex Komoroske (01:08:20):
Sure, yeah. The frame is the adjacent possible, which is I believe comes from design thinking. I've found it from designers in my life who are the ones who would just speak to it. And the adjacent possible is a set of actions that you do, that you can do. They are right in front of you that if you do them, they would work, almost certainly work. And in the tech industry in particular, we default assume that the adjacent possible is like this and then flying leap to something. And in reality, the adjacent possible is quite small. It's within arm's reach. And people will say, "Oh, you're being nihilist. You're limiting your potential. You're saying don't do big things." But when you recognize that your adjacent possible is relatively small, you realize that you actually have full agency to pick within the subset that is within your reach, and your actions matter because you take an action and now the world reconfigures and now you get a next set of actions and it's based partially on the action you just took.

(01:09:11):
And so if you slice this thing up and you have a coherent worldview and you have a principled approach, you can arc to wildly different outcomes than look like they were possible while at each point, each individual action is safe and reasonable. And so you can combine both of these things. I think so many times we try to jump and we jump to the end state of the thing. And actually you don't need to make that decision. If you can slice up your decisions into smaller and smaller decisions, I'm like, "This next step definitely makes sense." It will almost certainly pay for itself or the very least won't be too expensive. And then it might allow these other things to happen and you take it. And if those other things don't happen, okay, don't take another step on that path. That's fine. Go in other directions for a while. If it does, then take another step and another and another and another.

(01:09:50):
And this allows you to get rid of a lot of the risk and still be exposed to all the upside. And so the risk comes from trying to jump too far ahead in an unknown environment.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:02):
Is the general advice if someone's working on trying to figure out the roadmap, trying to think about what products to build is the advice, don't be scared to go a little incremental versus what people are always pushed, to do bigger.

Alex Komoroske (01:10:13):
You need both. So if you only do incremental, you will follow the shortest, the steepest gradient in front of you. So UXR says a user wants to do this and you'll do exactly that and you'll end up random walking through the thing. So you need coherence about where you're going and the way you get that is by creating a North Star for yourself. It should be in three to five years in the future, it should be very low resolution. It should describe a thing that every single person who reads it who has any kind of knowledge that might be useful or relevant agrees that it is plausible. If this happens, I would not say, "Well, a miracle happened." It'd say, "I could see how that could work." And lawyers say, "I could see how that could work." And someone who's worked on this 30 years ago at a similar product that Microsoft says, "I can see how that could work."

(01:10:51):
And that if you got to the end point, everyone would high five because if it's going to be a thing, they're like, "I guess that could work." At the end we'd be like, "Oh yeah, neat." That's not worth it. You want another story would be like, "Yeah, great. Wow, we kick off. We changed the way this entire industry works," or whatever. And now this is your North Star. North Star should update, but it's because it's far off in the distance. It will update. It will slide up across the sky a little bit. It won't be jerking around. You'll be arcing slightly differently. And then what you do is you look in your adjacent possible and you look for the thing that has the steepest gradient that pulls you towards your North Star. So you just want to go in that direction and you want to go in this direction. This one is second most in demand from what you think, but it's pulling you the direction that you believe will pull you there. Go in that one.

(01:11:31):
And then they keep on repeating. That's it. But you need both. Because if you only do incremental, then you'll end up random walking into a corner. And if you only do the long-term, you end up dreaming big and designing castles in the sky that are impossible to actually manifest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):
To give you a metaphor from an experience I had, I did this silent meditation retreat once, and a big part of Buddhism is to not cling to a specific outcome and not have a plan in mind and be sad if it doesn't work out. And so I asked them just how do you achieve success and want to be successful while not doing that? And their metaphor is point your card in a specific direction that you want to go. Just point your card in that direction, essentially in your example of North Star, and just start walking. Don't figure out this is exactly the path I'm going to take to get to this end destination.

Alex Komoroske (01:12:19):
Yeah. And you'll know after the fact, you'll say, "Oh, I curved a little bit or I had this little jog than there." And you'll say, "Ah, it would've been more efficient." But we're so focused on efficiency of not wasting effort that we ended up doing nothing at all or doing very dangerous things that don't work. So I'm much sure that I have a path that's slightly inefficient because we're navigating unknowns and we couldn't know no point. I think I've seen the number of times I find where people say, "I need to know for this strategy," that someone was trying to get me to look at and then say, "is this number in five years, is it going to be 93 or 95?" And it's like, I don't know. And it doesn't matter either if it's going to be that order of magnitude.

(01:12:56):
It doesn't matter, and we don't have to do that analysis if we believe that the order of magnitude is of that thing. It'd actually be we had spent all the time to get the illusion of precision, which at great expense, and then it's the people say, "Oh, I'm data-driven. I want to really run the analysis to ground." There's tons of stuff you can't know ahead of time. So if you're getting a false precision at the beginner, that's a comfort blanket. That's just helping you feel like there isn't uncertainty. There's uncertainty everywhere all the time. And trying to ignore it by trying to pin it down with fake numbers that you just made up for yourself at great expense is a really bad idea. And that's why if the ideas are strong enough, things that have a compounding return don't give you, "Oh, we'll either get 93 or 95." It's like, "We'll either get zero or we'll get 1,000." Great. It doesn't really matter if it's 1,000 or 1,001, who cares? It orders a magnitude larger than the alternative, and so it is better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:48):
That's really freeing. I noticed again, you were writing something. I'm again curious which you wrote down that you thought was insightful.

Alex Komoroske (01:13:54):
I actually this time I was not writing did something down. I was checking a thing I thought you might say that was going to reference was Tim Urban's, "Happiness is the reality minus expectations." I always get that backwards, but have you heard this frame, that happiness-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:07):
Let's get into it. Yeah, we're not going to get this. This is great.

Alex Komoroske (01:14:09):
"Happiness is reality minus expectations," and this is Tim Urban. It was from Wait But Why. And I think it's a very simple distillation of it, of if you set your expectations super high and it comes in and it's amazing, but it's below it, then it's a net negative. So the easiest thing, reality is hard to change. It's not impossible. It's hard to change. Your expectations are super easy. So just change your expectations. Hold it lightly and don't say, "Oh my gosh, this is going to be my kid's birthday. She's going to remember it. It's going to be the best birthday that she ever had and we're all it's going to be perfect." Because then when it doesn't go perfect and it starts raining that day, you're like, "Gosh." You get all worked up. Just say, "No, I want spend this day in a way that I can look back on and remember fondly." And that will include, yeah, it changed.

(01:14:54):
One other piece of advice someone gave me that I really like is try to feel the emotion about the story that'll make you feel in 10 years. So if it's funny in 10 years, try to see the humor in it now. And this one in particular was a friend, their newborn would, every time you changed her diaper, would poop. That was only... And when they did it, it would often be projectile. And so it was like a trap. You change the diaper. And it was like, what are you going to do in that situation? And then they're just like, "It's going to be a funny story in a few years, so let's see the humor in it now." Even though, God, I really wish this year-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
That's funny.

Alex Komoroske (01:15:29):
... you're not spraying poop on her. And I think that that kind of perspective is really, people sometimes hear this as, "Oh, you're saying don't dream big. Don't set high expectations. Don't expect more and be okay with mediocrity." That is not what I'm saying. I'm saying hold those expectations lightly. Allow them to change. Be willing to be convinced by different things, and seek something great. Seek something that you can be truly proud of and that feel very authentic to yourself if you achieved.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):
Alex, I feel like I could talk to you for hours. I can't believe it's already been almost an hour and a half. So just to wrap things up, is there anything else that you thought would be fun to share or maybe a piece of wisdom you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Alex Komoroske (01:16:13):
I think we covered it. I think we covered a lot of that. And again, we could go on for hours and hours and hours and hours. I could just do a random... I can feature The Compendium where I can pull up a random idea, and let's not do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:24):
Okay, amazing. Well, Alex, with that, we've reached the very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Alex Komoroske (01:16:28):
I am ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):
First question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Alex Komoroske (01:16:33):
Origin of Wealth by Eric Beinhocker, which is great. It's about a complexity economics, why the traditional economic model doesn't work, and also why it takes an evolutionary lens on what kinds of business plans work and how companies execute them. That I found my entree into a lot of the systems thinking and I thought it was just absolutely brilliant. And the other one is The Elements of Thinking in Systems, which is short, easy to read, very approachable. In fact, if anything, people think of it as not serious enough because it's too easy to read. It's one of those books that when you read at the beginning you'll say, "This sounds right." And then later, years later, if you read it again you'll go, "Oh my God, that was so... I wasn't ready for that yet, but that is totally the way." So she's one of the people who talks about dancing the systems. Let go and dance with the system is one of her lines, and I think it's just a phenomenal book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:21):
Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Alex Komoroske (01:17:24):
For me, I was thinking about this, it's The Green Knight, which I watched I think a few years old. It's about the Arthurian legend. It's a challenging movie. In fact, when I watched it, I was like, "I dislike this. I do not find this interesting." And then I couldn't stop thinking about it and it helped me. I think this is one of the reasons I like to write in parable is a parable is open-ended. It encourages and requires the listener to engage into the idea and play with it and see how it affects them and how they affect it. And so for me, The Green Knight, again, I'm not excited to watch it again, but I found it to be the most impactful movie I've seen in the last couple of years in terms of amount of thinking that it caused me to do afterwards.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):
Wow, that says a lot. Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Alex Komoroske (01:18:10):
To me, I think the answer for me is WebSim. It's the one that I like playing around with a lot. And I've said it before, I use Claude 20 times a day. I find that it's almost impossible for me to imagine doing work. I mean of course now I've got to use Strawberry and see how that feels, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:28):
One use case of WebSim that I found really fun that I used with Dylan is if you do Gmail, if you give it gmail.com/someone's name, it just comes up with what their email looks like. And could do it for famous people, like for Patrick Allison or whoever, and it's like, "Wow, that's really good."

Alex Komoroske (01:18:45):
The elements are really good. One of the things we played around with is having a thing that generates fake data of arbitrary schemas, and I just write a short backstory of a person and then have it generate data that fits in this fictional user person's world. And it's just amazing the kinds of stuff, the coherence it has with, it's weird and it's very specific to that story, but elements are just so, they're like these little holograms of all this information of humanity is interesting informational package, this little thing. And all kinds, it's like a mirror that different things reflect back out of it at you. And it's shocking sometimes to see humanity reflected back at you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):
It's like a zip file of all human knowledge.

Alex Komoroske (01:19:31):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):
Amazing. And it's because it's trained on all the things we've written, right?

Alex Komoroske (01:19:35):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:36):
All right, two more questions. You have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?

Alex Komoroske (01:19:43):
I guess I've said too, this is cheating, but I said too, the do things that give you energy that you're proud of, and the happiness is reality minus expectations I think are really simple clarifying words to look like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:56):
All right. Final question. You can go in one of two directions. One is what's something that you are going to add to this week's Bits and Bobs that you're thinking about right now that we haven't talked about? Or just go to your Compendium and pick a random thing and see what comes up and share.

Alex Komoroske (01:20:11):
Okay, so this is the... I'll just read this off.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:14):
Great.

Alex Komoroske (01:20:16):
This is written a year ago.

(01:20:18):
"We've forgotten a world without aggregators. Non-aggregator ecosystems make it so participants don't have to fear empowering their overlord, where that you have to worry about each bit of action you're doing, the aggregator is getting it more and more powerful. MySpace was the Wild West. Facebook made it so you can't change the CSS, which was better for users, containing some freedom. Aggregators make sense in the late stage of an era. At the beginning, they curtail too much exploration."

(01:20:42):
That's just my random reflections. I don't even remember what conversation that came from originally, but of the power of... I am just so obsessed with the idea that we are in the late stage of this current technical paradigm that we're in and so many things we feel like we figured them all out and nothing can be any different, and I don't love this outcome that we're in, the idea of you're... Just one quick framing. To me, if you ask somebody on the street to tell you what the canonical piece of software is, the answer they'll give you is something like Instagram, which is to say an app, which I think is a shame because an app is monolithic. It's one size fits all. It's not decomposable. It doesn't meaningfully interact with anything else in the broader ecosystem. And it's also only allowed to exist if some of the largest companies in the world say it may exist, which is insane to me.

(01:21:26):
To me, software is alchemy. It's the ability to extend human agency beyond ourselves to create something that can then combine with what others have created in unexpected and unforeseen ways to create this commentary of possibility of human agency. And somehow in the past decade, we've become convinced that all of this potential should be squeezed into about a dozen little boxes on your phone. And now with the power of AI, everyone just is default assuming that what's going to happen is we're all going to be locked inside of a box with a super God AI Clippy. And the only thing that people disagree about is which Clippy is it going to be? Whose Clippy is it going to be?

(01:21:57):
That to me is bonkers. I don't want that world at all. I want a world where we use this magical duct tape to escape the box, to allow software and humans using it to lean into their agency. And I think aggregators are amazing in an environment where you have a safe environment to have all kinds of interesting stuff that can't be fully open-ended because the aggregator can't allow it to escape the possibility of that ecosystem. And so for me, one of the reasons I'm excited about LLMs being a disruptive technology is I think that it allows us to get out of this monolithic sense of whatever. We're all just beholden to a decreasing number, very powerful organizations, and lean into everybody being able to be creative and collaborative and exercise their agency in a pro-social way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):
Wow. Well, you blew our mind as a final element of this conversation. Alex, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online? Where do they find stuff you're working on if they want to read more and follow the stuff you're thinking about? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Alex Komoroske (01:22:58):
Komoroske.com is where. My husband gives me so much shit for it because it looks like it was designed in the early 2000s, which it was. I link to all the different posts there. If you click, there's a Google group, but now where you can subscribe to my updates whenever I post in the Bits and Bobs or any medium article, that's a good way of taking touch as I publish stuff.

(01:23:16):
And then the way that Google can be useful to me is I have office hours on my site that are open to anybody to join in. I am continually, they're booked off in a few weeks in advance, but if you find something that resonated with you or that didn't, or you think is interesting or, "Oh, here's a parallel. I don't know if you've thought of it before," just reach out to me. And I love, love, love talking to people, interesting people especially who have life experiences and backgrounds that are different from mine. At one point, a magician showed up in my office hours and described and said, "Hey, this tactic you're talking about in your Bits and Bobs, that's actually cold reading. That's what psychics use." And I would find all these crazy connections they'd never occurred to me before. And so people just reaching out and sharing ideas and I love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):
Alex, you're awesome. This conversation was exactly what I was hoping it'd be. My brain is buzzing as I expected. Thank you so much for being here. I'm excited for folks to listen to this and to learn from you.

Alex Komoroske (01:24:10):
Thank you so much for having me.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You lead work on Codex.

Alexander Embiricos (00:00:01):
Codex is OpenAI's coding agent. We think of Codex as just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. It's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack, doesn't check Datadog unless you ask it to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
I remember Karpathy tweeted the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it.

Alexander Embiricos (00:00:21):
Starting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex be on call for its own training. Codex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training run, the key infrastructure. So we have a Codex code review that's catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually caught some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. One of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, the Sora Android app, like a fully new app, we built it in 18 days and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to the public.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
How do you think you win in this space?

Alexander Embiricos (00:00:47):
One of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity. If we're going to build a super system, has to be able to do things. One of the learnings over the past year is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer. It turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. And so we're kind of getting to this idea where if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
When you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks.

Alexander Embiricos (00:01:10):
A few of us are constantly on Reddit. There's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints. What we can do is as a product team just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):
Being at OpenAI, I can't not ask about how far you think we are from AGI.

Alexander Embiricos (00:01:28):
The current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Today, my guest is Alexander Embiricos, product lead for Codex, OpenAI's incredibly popular and powerful coding agent. In the words of Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT and former podcast guest, "Alex is one of my all time favorite humans I've ever worked with, and bringing him and his company into OpenAI ended up being one of the best decisions we've ever made." Similarly, Kevin Weil, OpenAI's CPO, said, "Alex is simply the best."

(00:01:59):
In our conversation, we chat about what it's truly like to build product at OpenAI, how Codex allowed the Sora team to ship the Sora app, which became the number one app in the app store in under one month. Also, the 20x growth Codex is seeing right now and what they did to make it so good at coding, why his team is now focused on making it easier to review code, not just write code, his AGI timelines, his thoughts on when AI agents will actually be really useful, and so much more. A huge thank you to Ed Bayes, Nick Turley, and Dennis Yang for suggesting topics for this conversation.

(00:05:14):
Alexander, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Alexander Embiricos (00:05:18):
Thank you so much. I've been following for ages and I'm excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):
I'm even more excited. I really appreciate that. I want to start with your time at OpenAI. So you joined OpenAI about a year ago. Before that, you had your own startup for about five years. Before that, you were a product manager at Dropbox. I imagine OpenAI is very different from every other place you've worked. Let me just ask you this, what is most different about how OpenAI operates and what's something that you've learned there that you think you're going to take with you wherever you go, assuming you ever leave?

Alexander Embiricos (00:05:49):
By far, I would say the speed and ambition of working at OpenAI are just dramatically more than what I can imagine. And I guess it's kind of an embarrassing thing to say because everyone who's a startup founder thinks like, "Oh yeah, my startup moves super fast and the talent bar is super high and we're super ambitious." But I have to say, working in OpenAI just made me reimagine what that even means.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):
We hear this a lot about feels like every AI company is just like, "Oh my God, I can't believe how fast they're moving." Is there an example of just like, "Wow, that wouldn't have happened this quickly anywhere else"?

Alexander Embiricos (00:06:20):
The most obvious thing that comes to mind is just the explosive growth of Codex itself. I think it's a while since we bumped our external number, but it's like the 10x-ing of Codex's scale was just super fast in a matter of months and it's well more since then. And once you've lived through that, or at least speaking for myself, having lived through that now, I feel like anytime I'm going to spend my time on building tech product, there's that speed and scale that I now need to meet.

(00:06:52):
If I think of what I was doing in my startup, it moved way slower and there's always this balance with startups of how much do you commit to an idea that you have versus find out that it's not working and then pivot. But I think one thing I've realized at OpenAI is the amount of impact that we can have and, in fact, need to have to do a good job is so high that I have to be way more ruthless with how I spend my time now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:15):
Before we get to Codex, is there a way that they've structured the org or, I don't know, the way that OpenAI operates that allows the team to move this quickly? Because everyone wants to move super fast. I imagine there's a structural approach to allowing this to happen.

Alexander Embiricos (00:07:29):
I mean, so one thing is just the technology that we're building with has just transformed so many things from both how we build, but also what kinds of things we can enable for users. And we spend most of our time talking about the sort of improvements within the foundation models, but I believe that even if we had no more progress today with models, which is absolutely not the case, but even if we had no more progress, we are way behind on product. There's so much more product to build. So I think just the moment is ripe, if that makes sense.

(00:08:01):
But I think there's a lot of counterintuitive things that surprised me when I arrived as far as how things are structured. One example that comes to mind is when I was working on my startup and before that, when I was at Dropbox, it was very important, especially as a PM to always rally the ship and it was like make sure you're pointed in the right direction and then you can accelerate in that direction. But here, I think because we don't exactly know what capabilities will even come up soon and we don't know what's going to work technically, and then we also don't know what's going to land even if it works technically, it's much more important for us to be very humble and learn a lot more empirically and just try things quickly. And the org is set up in that way to be incredibly bottoms up.

(00:08:45):
This is, again, one of those things that, as you were saying, everyone wants to move fast. I think everyone likes to say that they're bottoms up, or at least a lot of people do, but OpenAI is truly, truly bottoms up. And that's been a learning experience for me that now it'll be interesting if I ever work at... I don't think it'll even make sense to work at a non-AI company in the future. I don't even know what that means. But if I were to imagine it or go back in time, I think I would run things totally new.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):
What I'm hearing is this ready, fire, aim is the approach more than ready, aim, fire. And there's something, and as you process that, because that may not come across well, but I actually have heard this a lot at AI companies is because you don't know, and Nick Turley shared I think the same sentiment, because you don't know how people will use it it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time making it perfect. It's better to just get it out there in a primordial way, see how people use it, and then go big on that use case.

Alexander Embiricos (00:09:39):
Yeah. Okay, to use this analogy a little bit, I feel like there is an aim component, but the aim component is much fuzzier. It's kind of like, roughly what do we think can happen? Someone I've learned a ton from working here is a research lead, and he likes to say that at OpenAI, we can have really good conversations about something that's a year plus from now, and there's a lot of ambiguity in what will happen, but that's a right sort of timeline. And then we can have really good conversations about what's happening in low months or weeks. But there's this awkward middle ground, which was as you start approaching a year, but you're not at a year where it's very difficult to reason about, right?

(00:10:18):
And so as far as aiming, I think we want to know, "Okay, what are some of the futures that we're trying to build towards?" And a lot of the problems we're dealing with in AI, such as alignment are problems you need to be thinking out really far out into the future. So we're kind of aiming fuzzily there, but when it comes down to the more tactically like, "Oh yeah, what product will we build and therefore how will people use that product?" That's the place where we're much more like, "Let's find out empirically."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:41):
That's a good way of putting it. Something else that when people hear this, people sometimes hear companies like yours saying, "Okay, we're going to be bottoms up. We're going to try a bunch of stuff. We're not going to have exactly a plan of where it's going in the next few months." The key is you all hire the best people in the world. And so that feels like a really key ingredient in order to be this successful at bottoms up work.

Alexander Embiricos (00:11:02):
It just super resonates with me. I was just, again, surprised or even shocked when I arrived at the level of individual drive and autonomy that everyone here has. So I think the way that OpenAI runs, you can't read this or listen to a podcast and be like, "I'm just going to deploy this to my company." Maybe this is a harsh thing to say, but I think very few companies have the talent caliber to be able to do that. So it might need to be adjusted if you were going to implement this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):
Okay. So let's talk Codex. You lead work on Codex. How's Codex going? What numbers can you share? Is there anything you can share there? Also, just not everyone knows exactly what Codex is, explain what Codex is.

Alexander Embiricos (00:11:45):
Totally, yeah. So I had the very lucky job of living in the future and leading products on Codex. And Codex is OpenAI's coding agent. So super concretely, that means it's an IDE extension, a VS code extension that you can install or a terminal tool that you can install. And when you do so, you can then basically pair with Codex to answer questions about code, write code, run tests, execute code, and do a bunch of the work in that thick middle section of the software development lifecycle, which is all about writing code that you're going to get into production.

(00:12:21):
More broadly, we think of Codex as what it currently is just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. So when we use a big word like teammate, some of the things we're imagining are that it's not only able to write code, but actually it participates early on in the ideation and planning phases of writing software and then further downstream in terms of validation, deploying and maintaining code.

(00:12:46):
To make that a little more fun, one thing I like to imagine is if you think of what Codex is today, it's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack and doesn't check Datadog or Century unless you ask it to. And so no matter how smart it is, how much are you going to trust it to write code without you also working with it? So that's how people use it mostly today is they pair with it. But we want to get to the point where it can work just like a new intern that you hire, you don't only ask them to write code, but you ask them to participate across the cycle. So you know that even if they don't get something right the first try, they're eventually going to be able to iterate their rate there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:21):
I thought the point about not reading Slack and Datadog was it's just not distracted, it's just constantly focused and is always in flow. But I get what you're saying there is it doesn't have all the context on everything that's going on.

Alexander Embiricos (00:13:31):
Yeah. And that's not only true when it's performing a task, but again, if you think of the best team and teammates, you don't tell them what to do. Maybe when you first hire them, you have a couple meetings and you're like, "Hey," you learn, "Okay, these prompts work for this teammate, these prompts don't. This is how to communicate with this person." Then eventually you give them some starter tasks, you delegate a few tasks. But then eventually you just say like, "Hey, great. Okay, you're working with this set of people in this area of the code base. Feel free to work with other people on other parts of the code base too, even. And yeah, you tell me what you think makes sense to be done." And so we think of this as proactivity and one of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity.

(00:14:09):
I think this is critically important to achieve the mission of OpenAI, which is to deliver the benefits of AGI to all humanity. I like to joke today that AI products, and it's a half joke, they're actually really hard to use because you have to be very thoughtful about when it could help you. And if you're not prompting a model to help you, it's probably not helping you at that time. And if you think of how many times the average user is prompting AI today, it's probably tens of times. But if you think of how many times people could actually get benefit from a really intelligent entity, it's thousands of times per day. And so a large part of our goal with Codex is to figure out what is the shape of an actual teammate agent that is helpful by default.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:54):
When people think about Cursor and even Cloud Code, it's like a IDE that helps you code and auto completes code and maybe does some agentic work. What I'm hearing here is the vision is different, which is it's a teammate. It's like a remote teammate, a building code for you that you talk to and ask to do things. And that also does IDE, auto complete and things like that. Is that a kind of a differentiator in the way you think about Codex?

Alexander Embiricos (00:15:18):
It's basically this idea that if you're a developer and you're trying to get something done, we want you to just feel like you have superpowers and you're able to move much, much faster. But we don't think that in order for you to reap those benefits, you need to be sitting there constantly thinking about, "How can I invoke AI at this point to do this thing?" We want you to be able to plug it in to the way that you work and have it just start to do stuff without you having to think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:44):
Okay. I have a lot of questions along those lines, but just how's it going? Is there any stats, any numbers you can share about how Codex is doing?

Alexander Embiricos (00:15:49):
Yeah, Codex has been growing absolutely explosively since the launch of GPT-5 back in August. There's definitely some interesting product insights to talk about as to how we unlock that growth, if you're interested. But again, the last stat we shared there was we were well over 10x since August. In fact, it's been 20x since then. Also, the Codex models are serving many trillions of tokens a week now, and it's basically our most served coding model. One of the really cool things that we've seen is that the way that we decided to set up the Codex team was to build a really tightly integrated product and research team that are iterating on the model and the harness together. And it turns out that lets you just do a lot more and try many more experiments as to how these things will work together.

(00:16:35):
And so we were just training these models for use in our first party harness that we were very opinionated about. And then what we've started to see more recently actually is that other major API coding customers are now starting to adopt these models as well. And so we've reached a point where actually the Codex model is the most served coding model in the API as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:55):
You hinted at this, what unlocked this growth, I'm extremely interested in hearing that. It felt like before, I don't know, maybe this was before you joined the team, it just felt like Cloud Code was killing it. Just everyone was sitting on top of Cloud Code. It was by far the best way to code. And then all of a sudden Codex comes around. I remember Karpathy tweeted that he just has never seen a model like this. I think the tweet was the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it. What'd you guys do?

Alexander Embiricos (00:17:30):
We have this strong sort of mission here at OpenAI basically to build AGI. And so we think a lot about how can we shape the product so that it can scale. Earlier I was mentioning like, "Hey, if you're an engineer, you should be getting help from AI thousands of times per day," and so we thought a lot about the primitives for that when we launched our first version of Codex, which was Codex Cloud. And that was basically a product that had its own computer, lived in the cloud, you could delegate to it. And the coolest part about that is you could run many, many tasks in parallel. But some of the challenges that we saw are that it's a little bit harder to set that up, both in terms of environment configuration, like giving the model the tools it needs to validate its changes and to learn how to prompt in that way.

(00:18:20):
My analogy for this is, going back to this teammate analogy, it's like if you hired a teammate, but you're never allowed to get on a call with them and you can only go back and forth asynchronously over time. That works for some teammates and eventually that's actually how you want to spend most of your time. So that's still the future, but it's hard to initially adopt. And so we still have that vision of like, that's what we're trying to get you to, a teammate that you delegate to and then is proactive, and we're seeing that growing. But the key unlock is actually first you need to land with users in a way that's much more intuitive and trivial to get value from.

(00:18:54):
So the way that most people discover, the vast majority of users discover Codex today is either they download an IDE extension or they run it in their CLI and the agent works there with you on your computer interactively. And it works within a sandbox, which is actually a really cool piece of tech to help that be safe and secure, but it has access to all those dependencies. So if the agent needs to do something, it needs to run a command, it can do so within the sandbox. We don't have to set up any environment. And if it's a command that doesn't work in the sandbox, it can just ask you. And so you can get into this really strong feedback loop using the model. And then over time, our team's job is to help turn that feedback loop into you as a byproduct of using the product, configuring it so that you can then be delegating to it down the line.

(00:19:38):
And again, analogy, keep coming back to it, but if you hire a teammate and you ask them to do work, but you just give them a fresh computer from the store, it's going to be hard for them to do their job. But if as you work with them side by side, you could be like, "Oh, you don't have a password for this service we use, here's the password for this service. Yeah, don't worry, feel free to run this command," then it's much easier for them to then go off and do work for hours without you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
So what I'm hearing is the initial version of Codex was almost too far in the future. It's like a remote in the cloud agent that's coding for you asynchronously. And what you did is, "Okay, let's actually come back a little bit, let's integrate into the way engineers already integrate into IDs and locally and help them on ramp to this new world,"

Alexander Embiricos (00:20:21):
Totally. And it was quite interesting because we dogfood product a ton at OpenAI. So dogfood as in we use our own product. And so Codex has been accelerating OpenAI over the course of the entire year, and the cloud product was a massive accelerant to the company as well. It just turns out that this was one of those places where the signal we got from dogfooding is a little bit different from the signal you get from the general market because at OpenAI, we train reasoning models all day and so we're very used to this kind of prompting and think upfront, run things massively in parallel and it would take some time and then come back to it later asynchronously. And so now when we build, we still get a ton of signal from dogfooding internally, but we're also very cognizant of the different ways that different audiences use the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
That's really funny. It's like live in the future, but maybe not too far in the future. And I could see how everyone at OpenAI is living very far in the future, and sometimes that won't work for everyone.

Alexander Embiricos (00:21:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):
What about just intelligence training data? I don't know, is there something else that helped Codex accelerate its ability to actually code? Is it better, cleaner data? Is it more just models advancing? Is there anything else that really helped accelerate?

Alexander Embiricos (00:21:38):
Yeah, so there's a few components here. I guess you were mentioning models and the models have improved a ton. In fact, just last Wednesday, we shipped GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, a very accurately named model, that is awesome. It is awesome both because it is for any given task that you were using GPT-5.1-Codex for, it's roughly 30% faster at accomplishing that task. But also it unlocks a ton of intelligence. So if you use it at our higher reasoning levels, it's just even smarter. And that tweet you were saying Karpathy made about, "Hey, give this your gnarliest bugs," obviously there's a ton going on in the market right now, but Codex-Max is definitely carrying that mantle of us tackling the hardest bugs. So that is super cool.

(00:22:28):
But I will say it's like some of how we're thinking about this is evolving a little bit from being like, "Yeah, we're just going to think about the model and let's just train the best model," to really thinking about what is an agent actually overall? And I'm not going to try to define agent exactly, but at least the stack that we think of it as having is it's like you have this model, really smart reasoning model that knows how to do a specific kind of task really well, so we can talk about how we make that possible. But then actually we need to serve that model through an API into a harness, and both of those things also have a really big role here.

(00:23:02):
So for instance, one of the things that we're really proud of is you can have GPT-5.1-Codex-Max work for really long periods of time. That's not normal, but you can set it up to do that or that might happen. But now routinely we'll hear about people saying, "Yeah, it ran overnight or it ran for 24 hours." And so for a model to work continuously for that amount of time, it's going to exceed its context window. And so we have a solution for that, which we call compaction.

(00:23:28):
But compaction is actually a feature that uses all three layers of that stack. So you need to have a model that has a concept of compaction and knows like, "Okay, as I start to approach this context window, I might be asked to prepare to be run in a new context window." And then at the API layer, you need an API that understands this concept and has an endpoint that you can hit to do this change. And at the harness layer, you need a harness that can prepare the payload for this to be done. So shipping this compaction feature that now just made this behavior possible to anyone using Codex actually meant working across all three things. And I think that's increasingly going to be true.

(00:24:02):
Another maybe underappreciated version of this is if you think about all the different coding products out there, they all have very different tool harnesses with very different opinions on how the model should work. So if you want to train a model to be good at all the different ways it could work, maybe you have a strong opinion that it should work using semantic search. Maybe you have a strong opinion that it should call bespoke tools or maybe you have, in our case, a strong opinion that it should just use the shell and work in the terminal, you can move much faster if you're just optimizing for one of those worlds. So the way that we built Codex is that it just uses the shell, but in order to make that safer and secure, we have a sandbox that the model is used to operating in.

(00:24:45):
So I think one of the biggest accelerants, to go all the way back to answer to your question, is just we're building all three things in parallel and tuning each one and constantly experimenting with how those things work with a tightly integrated product and research team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):
Do you think you win in this space? Do you think it'll always be this kind of race with other models constantly leapfrogging each other? Do you think there's a world where someone just runs away with it and no one else can ever catch up? Is there a path to just, "We win"?

Alexander Embiricos (00:25:15):
Again, comes back to this idea of building a teammate, and not just a teammate that participates in team planning and prioritization, not just a teammate that really tests its code and helps you maintain and deploy it. But even a teammate... If you think, again, an engineering teammate, they can also schedule a calendar invite or move standup or do whatever, right? And so in my mind, if we just imagine that every day or every week some crazy new capability is just going to be deployed by a research lab, it's just impossible for us as humans to keep up and use all this technology. So I think we need to get to this world where you kind of just have an AI teammate or super assistant that you just talk to and it just knows how to be helpful on its own. So you don't have to be reading the latest tips for how to use it, you've plugged it in and it just provides help.

(00:26:10):
So that's kind of the shape of what I think we're building. And I think that will be a very sticky winning product if we can do so. So the shape that in my head, at least I have, is that we build... Maybe a fun topic is like, "Is Chat the right interface for AI?" I actually think Chat is a very good interface when you don't know what you're supposed to use it for. In the same way that if I think of I'm on MS Teams or in Slack with a teammate, Chat is pretty good. I can ask for whatever I want. It's kind of the common denominator for everything. So you can chat with a super assistant about whatever topic you want, whether it be coding or not. And then if you are a functional expert in a specific domain such as coding, there's a GUI that you can pull up to go really deep and look at the code and work with the code.

(00:26:54):
So I think what we need to build as OpenAI is basically this idea of you have Chat, ChatGPT and not as a tool that's ubiquitously available to everyone, you start using it even outside of work to just help you. You become very comfortable with the idea of being accelerated with AI. So then you get to work and you just can naturally just, "Yeah, I'm just going to ask it for this and I don't need to know about all the connectors or all the different features. I'm just going to ask it for help and it'll surface to me the best way that it can help at this point in time and maybe even chime in when I didn't ask it for help." So in my mind, if we can get to that, I think that's how we really build the winning product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
This is so interesting because with my chat with Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, I think he shared that the original name for ChatGPT was Super Assistant or something like that. And it's interesting that there's that approach to the super assistant and then there's this Codex approach. It's almost like the B2C version and the B2B version. And what I'm hearing is the idea here is, okay, you start with coding and building and then it's doing all this other stuff for you, scheduling meetings, I don't know, probably posting in Slack, I don't know, shipping designs. I don't know, is the idea that this is the business version of ChatGPT in a sense, or is there something else there?

Alexander Embiricos (00:28:08):
Yeah. So we're getting to the one-year time horizon conversation. A lot of this might happen sooner, but in terms of fuzziness, I think we're at the one year. So I'll give you a contention and a plausible way we get there, but as for how it happens, who knows? So basically, if we're going to build a super assistant, it has to be able to do things. So we're going to have a model and it's going to be able to do stuff affecting your world. And one of the learnings I think we've seen over the past year or so is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer.

(00:28:41):
Right, okay, so now we're like, okay, we need the super assistant that can use a computer, or many computers. And now the question is, okay, well, how should it use the computer? And there's lots of ways to use a computer. You could try to hack the OS and use accessibility APIs, maybe a bit easier as you could point and click. That's a little slow and unpredictable sometimes. And another way, it turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. So we're kind of getting to this idea where, well, if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent and maybe to the user, a non-technical user, they won't even know they're using a coding agent, the same way that no one thinks about are they using the internet or not, which is they're more just like, "Is WiFi on?"

(00:29:23):
So I think that what we're doing with Codex is we're building a software engineering teammate, and as part of that, we're kind of building an agent that can use a computer by writing code. And so we're already seeing some pull for this. It's quite early, but we're starting to see people who are using Codex for coding adjacent product purposes. And so as that develops, I think we'll just naturally see that, oh, it turns out we should just always have the agent write code if there is a coding way to solve a problem instead of... Even if you're doing a financial analysis, maybe write some code for that.

(00:29:55):
So basically like you were like, "Hey, is this the two ends of this product for the super assistant of ChatGPT?" In my mind, just coding is a core competency of any agent including ChatGPT. And so really what we think we're building is that competency. So here's the really cool thing about agents writing code is that you can import code. Code is composable, interoperable. Because one very reductive view we could have for an agent is it's just going to be given a computer and it's just going to point and click and go around. But that is the future. And then how we get there is difficult to chart a path because a lot of the questions around building agents aren't like, "Can the agent do it?" But it's more about, "Well, how can we help the agent understand the context that it's working in?" And the team that's using it probably has a way that they like to do things. They have guidelines. They probably want certain deterministic guarantees about what the agent can or cannot do. Or they want to know that the agent understands this detail.

(00:30:57):
An example would be if we're looking at a crash reporting tool, hitting a connector for it, every sub-team probably has a different meta prompt for how they want the crashes to be analyzed. And so we start to get to this thing where, yeah, we have this agent sitting in front of a computer, but we need to make that configurable for the team or for the user and let them... Stuff that the agent does often, we probably just want to build in as a competency that this agent has that it can do.

(00:31:24):
So I think we end up with this generalizable thing, that you were saying, of an agent that can just write its own scripts for whatever it wants to do. But I think that the really key part here is can we make it so that everything that the agent has to do often or that it does well, we can just remember and store so that the agent doesn't have to write a script for that again? Or maybe if I just joined a team and you are already on the same team as me, I can just use all those scripts that the agents had written already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
Yeah, it's like if this is our teammate, they can share things that it's learned from working with other people at the company. It just makes sense as a metaphor.

Alexander Embiricos (00:32:01):
Right. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
It feels like you're in the Karpathy camp of, "Agents today are not that great and mostly slop and maybe in the future they'll be awesome." Does that resonate?

Alexander Embiricos (00:32:11):
So I think coding agents are pretty great. I think we're seeing a ton of value there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):
Yeah, that feels right. That feels right, yeah.

Alexander Embiricos (00:32:17):
And then I think agents outside of coding, it's still very early. And this is just my opinion, but I think they're going to get a whole lot better once they can use coding too in a composable way. It's kind of the fun part of when you're building for software engineers, at my startup, we were building for software engineers too for a lot of that journey, and they're just such a fun audience to build for because they also like building for themselves and are often even more creative than we are in thinking about how to use the technology. So by building for software engineers, you get to just observe a ton of emergent behaviors and things that you should do and build into the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:54):
I love how you say that because a lot of people building for engineers get really annoyed because the engineers they're just always complaining about stuff. They're like, "Ah, that sucks. Why'd you build it this way?" I love that you enjoy it, but I think it's probably because you're building such an amazing tool for engineers that can actually solve problems and just code for them.

(00:33:12):
Kind of along those lines, there's always this talk of what will happen with jobs, engineers, coding, do you have to learn coding? All these things. Clearly the way you're describing it is it's a teammate, it's going to work with you, make you more superhuman, it's not going to replace you. What's the way you just think about the impact on the field of engineering, having this super intelligent engineering teammate?

Alexander Embiricos (00:33:33):
I think there's two sides to it, but the one we were just talking about is this idea that maybe every agent should actually use code and be a coding agent. And in my mind, that's just a small part of this broader idea that, hey, as we make code even more ubiquitous... I mean, you could probably claim it's ubiquitous today, even pre AI, right? But as we make code even more ubiquitous, it's actually just going to be used for many more purposes. And so there's just going to be a ton more need for humans with this competency.

(00:34:01):
So that's my view. I think this is quite a complex topic. So it's something we talk about a lot and we have to see how it pans out. But I think what we can do basically as a product team building in the space is just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?

(00:34:27):
I think, to give an example right now, nowadays when you work with a coding agent, it writes a ton of code, but it turns out writing code is actually one of the most fun parts of software engineering for many software engineers. So then you end up reviewing AI code. And that's often a less fun part of the job for many software engineers. So I actually think we see that this plays out all the time in a ton of micro decisions. So we as a product team, we're always thinking about, "Okay, how do we make this more fun? How do we make you feel more empowered? Where is this not working?" And I would argue that reviewing agent written code is a place that today is less fun.

(00:35:04):
So then I think, "Okay, what can we do about that?" Well, we can ship a code review feature that helps you build confidence in the AI written code. Okay, cool. Another thing we could do is we can make it so that the agent's better able to validate its work. And it gets all the way down into micro decisions. If you're going to have an agent capability to validate work, and let's say you have... I'm thinking of Codex Web right now, you have a pain that sort of reflects the work the agent did, what do you see first? Do you see the diff or do you see the image preview of the code it wrote? And I think if you're thinking about this from perspective, "How do I empower the human? How do I make them feel as accelerated as possible?" You obviously see the image first. You shouldn't be reviewing the code unless first you've seen the image, unless maybe it's been reviewed by an AI and now it's time for you to take a look.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):
When I had Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor on the podcast, he had this kind of vision of us moving to something beyond code. And I've seen this rise of something called spec-driven development where you just write the spec and then the AI writes code for you. So you start working at this higher abstraction level. Is that something you see where we're going, just like engineers not having to actually write code or look at code and there's going to be this higher level of abstraction that we focus on?

Alexander Embiricos (00:36:16):
Yeah. I mean, I think there's constantly these levels of abstraction and they're actually already played out today. Today, coding agents, mostly it's prompt to patch. We're starting to see people doing spec-driven development or planned and driven development. That's actually one of the ways when people ask, "Hey, how do you run Codex on a really long task?" Well, it's like often collaborate with it first to write a plan.md, like a markdown file that's your plan. And once you're happy with that, then you ask it to go off and do work. And if that plan has verifiable steps, it'll work for much longer. So we're totally seeing that.

(00:36:50):
I think spec-driven development is an interesting idea. It's not clear to me that it'll work out that way because a lot of people don't like writing specs either, but it seems plausible that some people will work that way. A bit of a joke idea though is if you think of the way that many teams work today, they often don't necessarily have specs, but the team is just really self-driven and so stuff just gets done. And so almost that it's like, I'm coming up with this on the spot, so it's not a good name, but chatter-driven development where it's just like stuff is happening on social media and in your team communications tools. And then as a result, code gets written and deployed.

(00:37:29):
So yeah, I think I'm a little bit more oriented in that way of I don't even necessarily want to have to write a spec. Sometimes I want to, only if I like writing specs. Other times I might just want to say like, "Hey, here's the customer service channel and tell me what's interesting to know, but if it's a small bug, just fix it." I don't want to have to write a spec for that, right?

(00:37:51):
I have this sort of hypothetical future that I like to share sometimes with people as a provocation, which is in a world where we have truly amazing agents, what does it look like to be a solopreneur? And one terrible idea for how it could look is that actually there's a mobile app and every idea that the agent has to do is just vertical video on your phone and then you can swipe left if you think it's a bad idea and you can swipe right if it's a good idea. And you can press and hold and speak to your phone if you want to give feedback on the idea before you swipe. And in this world, basically what your job is is just to plug in this app into every single signal system or system of record, and then you just sit back and swipe. I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:39):
I love this. So this is like Tinder meets TikTok meets Codex.

Alexander Embiricos (00:38:42):
It's pretty terrible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:43):
No, this is great. So the idea here is this agent is watching and listening to you, paying attention to the market, your users, and it's like, "Cool, here's something I should do." It's like a proactive engineer just like, "Here, we should build this feature, fix this thing."

Alexander Embiricos (00:38:56):
Exactly. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
I think it's a really good idea.

Alexander Embiricos (00:39:00):
Communicating with you in the lowest effort way for your consumers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:02):
Yeah, yeah, the modern way we communicate, swipe left to right and vertical feed. And then the Sora video, okay, so I see how this all connects now. I see.

Alexander Embiricos (00:39:11):
Yeah. To be clear, we're not building that, but it's a fun idea. I mean, in this example though, one of the things that it's doing is it's consuming external signals, right? I think the other really interesting thing is if we think about what is the most successful AI product to date, I would argue, it's funny actually not to confuse things at all, but the first time we used the brand Codex at OpenAI was actually the model powering GitHub Copilot. This is way back in the day, years ago. And so we decided to reuse that brand recently because it's just so good, Codex, code execution.

(00:39:46):
But I think actually auto completion and IDEs is one of the most successful AI products today. And part of what's so magical about it is that when it can surface ideas for helping you really rapidly, when it's right, you're accelerated. When it's wrong, it's not that annoying. It can be annoying, but it's not that annoying. So you can create this mixed initiative system that's contextually responding to what you're attempting to do.So in my mind, this is a really interesting thing for us as OpenAI as we're building.

(00:40:22):
So for instance, when I think about launching a browser, which we did with Atlas, in my mind, one of the really interesting things we can then do is we can then contextually surface ways that we can help you as you're going about your day. And so we break out of this, we're just looking at code or we're just in your terminal into this idea that, "Hey, a real teammate is dealing with a lot more than just code. They're dealing with a lot of things that are web content. So how can we help you with that?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:51):
Man, there's so much there. I love this. Okay, so auto complete on web with the browser. That's so interesting. Just like, "Here's all the things that we can help you with as you're browsing and going about your day."

(00:41:01):
I want to talk about Atlas. I'll come back to that. Codex, code execution, did not know that. That's really clever. I get it now. Okay, and then this chatter, what is a chatter-driven development? No, this is a really good idea, but it reminds me, I had Dhanji on the podcast, CTO of Block, and they have this product called Goose, which is their own internal agent thing. And he talked about an engineer at Block just has Goose watch him with his screen and listens to every meeting and proactively does work that he should probably want to do. So ships to PR, sends an email, drafts a Slack message. So he's doing exactly what you're describing in kind of a very early way.

Alexander Embiricos (00:41:45):
Yeah, that's super interesting. And I bet you, so if we went and asked them what the bottleneck to that productivity is, did they share what it is?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:54):
Probably looking at it and just making sure this is the right thing to do, yeah.

Alexander Embiricos (00:41:58):
Yeah. So we see this now. We have a Slack integration for Codex. People love if there's something that you need to do quickly, people will just @ mention Codex, "Why do you think this bug is happening?" It doesn't have to be an engineer. Even maybe data scientists often here are using Codex a ton to just answer questions like, "Why do you think this metric moved? What happened?" So questions, you get the answer right back in Slack. It's amazing, super useful. But as for when it's writing code, then you have to go back and look at the code.

(00:42:25):
So the real, I think, bottleneck right now is validating that the code worked and writing code review. So in my mind, if we wanted to get to something like the friend you were talking about's world, I think we really need to figure out how to get people to configure their coding agents to be much more autonomous on those later stages of the work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):
It makes sense. Like you said, writing code, I used to be an engineer, I was an engineer for 10 years, really fun to write code, really fun to just get in the flow, build architect, test. Not so fun to look at everyone else's code and just have to go through and be on the hook if it's doing something dumb that's going to take down production. And now that building has become easier, what I've always heard from companies that are really at the cutting edge of this is the bottleneck is now figuring out what to build. And then it's at the end of like, "Okay, we have all this, all 100 PRs to review. Who's going to go through all that?"

Alexander Embiricos (00:43:14):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:15):
Yeah.

(00:43:17):
This episode is brought to you by Jira Product Discovery. The hardest part of building products isn't actually building products. It's everything else.

(00:44:08):
What has the impact of Codex been on the way you operate as a product person as a PM? It's clear how engineering is impacted, code is written for you. What has it done to the way you operate and the way PMs operate at OpenAI?

Alexander Embiricos (00:44:24):
Yeah, I mean, I think mostly I just feel much more empowered. I've always been sort of more technical leaning PM, and especially when I'm working on products for engineers, I feel like it's necessary to dogfood the product. But even beyond that, I just feel like I can do much, much more as a PM. And Scott Belsky talks about this idea of compressing the talent stack. I'm not sure if I've phrased that right. But it's basically this idea that maybe the boundaries between these roles are a little bit less needed than before because people can just do much more. And every time someone can do more, you can skip one communication boundary and make the team that much more efficient.

(00:45:03):
So I think we see it in a bunch of functions now, but I guess since you asked about products specifically, now answering questions much, much easier. You can just ask Codex for thoughts on that. A lot of PM type work, understanding what's changing. Again, just ask Codex for help with that. Prototyping is often faster than writing specs. This is something that a lot of people have talked about.

(00:45:29):
I think something that, I don't think it's super surprising, but something that's slightly surprising is we see... We're mostly building Codex to write code that's going to be deployed to production, but actually we see a lot of throwaway code written with Codex now. It's kind of going back to this idea of ubiquitous code. So you'll see someone wants to do an analysis. If I want to understand something, it's like, okay, just give Codex a bunch of data, but then ask it to build an interactive data viewer for this data. That's just too annoying to do in the past, but now it's just totally worth the time of just getting an agent to go do something.

(00:46:02):
Similarly, I've seen some pretty cool prototypes on our design team about if you want to... Well, a designer basically wanted to build an animation, and this is the Coin Animation Codex, and it was like normally it'd be too annoying to program this animation. So they just vibe coded a animation editor and then they use the animation editor to build the animation, which they then check into their repo.

(00:46:24):
Actually, our designers, there's a ton of acceleration there. And speaking of compressing the talent stack, I think our designers are very PME. So they do a ton of product work and they actually have an entire vibe coded side prototype of the Codex app. And so a lot of how we talk about things is we'll have a really quick jam because there's 10,000 things going on, and then the designer will go think about how this should work. But instead of talking about it again, they'll just vibe code a prototype of that in their standalone prototype. We'll play with it. If we like it, they'll vibe engineer that prototype into an actual PR to land. And then depending on their comfort with the code base, like Codex utilizing Rust is a little harder, maybe they'll land it themselves or they'll get close and then an engineer can help them land the PR.

(00:47:11):
We recently shipped the Sora Android app, and that was one of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, actually, because usage of Codex internally at OpenAI is obviously really, really high, but it's been growing over the course of the year, both in terms of now it's basically all technical staff use it, but even the intensity and know how of how to make the most of coding agents has gone up by a ton. And so the Sora Android app, a fully new app, we built it in 18 days. It went from zero to launch to employees, and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to just GA, to the public, and that was done just with the help of Codex. So pretty insane velocity.

(00:47:55):
I would say it was a little bit... I don't want to say easy mode, but there is one thing that Codex is really good at if you're a company that's building software on multiple platforms, so you've already figured out some of the underlying APIs or systems, asking Codex to port things over is really effective because it has something you can go look at. And so the engineers on that team were basically having Codex go look at the iOS app, produce plans of work that needed to be done, and then go implement those. And it was looking at iOS and Android at the same time. And so basically it was two weeks to launch to employees, four weeks total. Insanely fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:31):
What makes that even more insane is it became the number one app in the app store. This just boggles the mind. Okay, so 28 days?

Alexander Embiricos (00:48:39):
Yeah, so imagine number one app in the app store with a handful of engineers. I think it was two or three possibly in a handful of weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):
Yeah, this is absurd. Wow.

Alexander Embiricos (00:48:56):
Yeah, so that's a really fun example of acceleration. And then Atlas was the other one that I think Ben did a podcast, the engine lead on Atlas, sharing a little bit about how we built there. Atlas is actually... I mean, it's a browser, and building a browser is really hard. So we had to build a lot of difficult systems in order to do that. And basically we got to the point where that team has a ton of power users of Codex right now, and it got to the point they where basically... We were talking to them about it, because a lot of those engineers are people I used to work with before at my startup. And so they'd say, "Before this would've taken us two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week." So massive acceleration there as well.

(00:49:49):
And what's quite cool is that we shipped Atlas on Mac first, but now we're working on the Windows version. So the team now is ramping up on Windows and they're helping us make Codex better on Windows too, which is admittedly earlier, just the model we shipped last week is the first model that natively understands PowerShell. So PowerShell being the native Shell language on Windows. So yeah, it's been really awesome to see the whole company getting accelerated by Codex from... And most obviously, also research and improving how quickly we train models and how well we do it. And then even design, as we talked about, and marketing. Actually, we're at this point now where my product marketer is often also making string changes just directly from Slack or updating docs directly from Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
These are amazing examples. You guys are living at the bleeding edge of what is possible, and this is how other companies are going to work. Just shipping, again, what became the number one app in the app store and just beloved all over the... It just took over, I don't know, the world for at least a week. Built, you said, in 28 days and I don't know, 10 days, 18 days just to get the core of it working.

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:00):
Yeah, so it was like 18 days we had a thing that employees were playing with, and then 10 days later we were out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:05):
And you said just a couple engineers.

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:07):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):
Two or three. Okay. And then Atlas you said took a week to build?

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:12):
No, no, no. So Atlas, not the whole week, but Atlas was a really meaty project. And so I was talking to one of the engineers on Atlas about just what they use Codex for. And it's basically like, "We use Codex for absolutely everything." And I was like, "Okay, well, how would you measure the acceleration?" And so basically the answer I got back was, "Previously would've taken two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):
Do you think this eventually moves to non-engineers doing this sort of thing? Does it have to be an engineer building this thing? Could Sora have been built by, I don't know, a PM or designer?

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:45):
I think we will very much get to the point, well, basically where the boundaries are a little bit blurred. I think you're going to want someone who understands the details of what they're building, but what details those are will evolve. Kind of like how now if you're writing Swift, you don't have to speak assembly. There's a handful of people in the world, and it's really important that they exist and speak assembly, maybe more than a handful, but that's a specialized function that most companies don't need to have.

(00:52:14):
So I think we're just going to naturally see an increase in layers of abstraction. And then the cool thing is now we're entering the language layer of abstraction, like natural language, and then natural language itself is really flexible. You could have engineers talking about a plan and then you could have engineers talking about a spec, and then you could have engineers talking about just a product or an idea. So I think we can also start moving up those layers of abstraction as well.

(00:52:39):
But I do think this is going to be gradual. I don't think it's going to go off to all of a sudden nobody ever writes anything, any code and it's just specs. I think it's going to be much more like, "Okay, we've set up our coding agent to be really good at previewing the build or at running tests," maybe that's the first part that most people have set up. And it's like, "Okay, now we've set it up so they can execute the build and it can see the results of its own changes, but we haven't yet built a good integration harness so that it can," in the case of Atlas... By the way, I don't know if they've done any of this or not. I think they've done a lot of this. But maybe the next stage is enable it to load a few sample pages to see how well those work. So then, okay, now we're going to set it up to do that.

(00:53:18):
And I think for some time at least, we're going to have humans curating which of these connectors or systems or components that the agent needs to be good at talking to. And then in the future, there will be an even greater unlock where Codex tells you how to set it up or maybe sets itself up in a repo.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):
What a wild time to be alive. Wow. I'm curious just the second order effects of this sort of thing, just how quickly it is to build stuff. What does that do? Does that mean distribution becomes much, much more important? Does it mean ideas are just worth a lot more? It's interesting to think about how quick how that changes.

Alexander Embiricos (00:53:51):
I'm curious what you think. I still don't think ideas are worth as much as maybe a lot of people think. I still think execution is really hard. You can build something fast, but you still need to execute well on it, still needs to make sense and be a coherent thing overall, yeah, and distribution is massive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
Yeah. Just feels like everything else is now more important. Everything that isn't the building piece, which is coming up with an idea, getting to market, profit, all that kind of stuff.

Alexander Embiricos (00:54:18):
Yeah. I think we might've been in this weird temporary phase where, for a while, it was so hard to build product that you mostly just had to be really good at building product and it maybe didn't matter if you had an intimate understanding of a specific customer. But now I think we're getting to this point where actually if I could only choose one thing to understand, it would be really meaningful understanding of the problems that a certain customer has. If I could only go in with one core competency.

(00:54:52):
So I think that's ultimately still what's going to matter most. If you're starting a new company today and you have a really good understanding and network of customers that are currently underserved by AI tools, I think you're set. Whereas if you're good at building websites, but you don't have any specific customer to build for, I think you're in for a much harder time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:14):
Bullish on vertical AI startups is what I'm hearing. Yeah, I completely agree. There's the general thing that can solve a lot of problems and then there's like, "We're going to solve presentations incredibly well and we're going to understand the presentation problem better than anyone and we're going to plug into your workflows and all these other things that matter for a very specific problem." Okay, incredible.

(00:55:36):
When you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks. What's something you look at to tell you, "Okay, we're making really good progress," I imagine it's not going to be the one thing, but what do you focus on? What's something you're trying to push? What's a KPI or two?

Alexander Embiricos (00:55:51):
One of the things that I'm constantly reminding myself of is that a tool like Codex naturally is a tool that you would become a power user of. So we can accidentally spend a lot of our time thinking about features that are very deep in the user adoption journey. And so we can kind of end up oversolving for that. And so I think it's just critically important to go look at your D7 retention. Just go try the product, sign up from scratch again. I have a few too many ChatGPT Pro accounts that I've, in order to maximally correctly dogfood, signed up for on my Gmail and they charge me 200 bucks a month. I need to expense those. But I think just the feeling of being end user and the early retention stats are still super important for us because as much as this category is taking off, I think we're still in the very early days of people using them.

(00:56:44):
Another thing that we do that I think we might be the most user feedback/social media pilled team out there in this space is like a few of us are constantly on Reddit and Twitter, and there's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints, but we take the complaints very seriously and look at them. And I think that, again, because you can use a coding agent for so many different things, it often is kind of broken in many sort of ways for specific behaviors. So we actually monitor a lot just what the vibes are on social media pretty often, especially I think for Twitter/X, it's a little bit more hypey and then Reddit is a little more negative but real actually. So I've started increasingly paying attention to how people are talking about using Codex on Reddit actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
This is important for people to know. Which of the subreddits do you check most? Is there like an r/Codex or?

Alexander Embiricos (00:57:44):
I mean, the algorithm's pretty good at surfacing stuff, but r/Codex is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):
Okay. I'll take. Very interesting. And then if people tag you on Twitter, you still see that, but maybe not as powerful as seeing it on Reddit.

Alexander Embiricos (00:57:56):
Well, yeah. Well, the thing with Twitter is it's a little bit more one-to-one, even if it's in public. Whereas with Reddit, those are really good upvoting mechanics and maybe most people are still not bots, unclear. So you get good signal on what matters and what other people think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):
So interestingly, Atlas, I want to talk about that briefly. You guys launched Atlas. I tweeted actually that I tried Atlas and then I don't love the AI only search experience. I was just like, "I just want Google sometimes," or whatever. Just waiting for AI to give me an answer, I'm like, "I don't want to... " And there was no way to switch. I just tweeted, "Hey, I'm switching back. It's not great." And I feel like I made some PMs at OpenAI sad. And I saw someone tweet, "Okay, we have Atlas now," which I imagine was always part of the plan. It's probably an example of just, "We got to ship stuff, see how people use it and then we figure it out." So I guess one is that, I don't know, is there anything there? And two, I'm just curious, why are you guys building a web browser?

Alexander Embiricos (00:58:48):
So I worked on Atlas for a bit. I don't work on it now. But a bit of the narrative here for me just to tell my story a bit was I was working on this screen sharing, pair programming startup, and then we joined OpenAI. And so the idea was really to build a contextual desktop assistant. And the reason I believe that's so important is because I think that it's really annoying to have to give all your context to an assistant and then to figure out how it can help you. So if it could just understand what you are trying to do, then it could maximally accelerate you. So I still think of Codex actually as a contextual assistant from a little bit of a different angle, starting with coding tasks.

(00:59:30):
But some of the thinking, at least for me personally, I can't speak for the whole project, was that a lot of work is done in the web. And if we could build a browser, then we could be contextual for you, but in a much more first class way. We weren't hacking other desktop software which have very varied support for what content they're rendering to the accessibility tree. We wouldn't be relying on screenshots, which are a little bit slower and unreliable. Instead, we could be In the rendering engine and extract whatever we needed to help you. And also I like to think of video games, I don't know if you've played, I don't know, say Halo, you walk up to an object, I mean, this is true for many games, you press... Man, it's been a long time, this is embarrassing. Press X and it just does the right thing. And I was one of those guys who always read the instruction manual for every video game that I bought.

(01:00:24):
And I remember the first time I read about a contextual action and I just thought it was this really cool idea. And the thing about a contextual action is we need to know what you are attempting to do. We have a little bit of context and then we can help. And I think this is critically important because imagine this world that we reach where we have agents that are helping you thousands of times per day.

(01:00:49):
Imagine if the only way we could tell you that we helped you was if we could push notify you. So you get a thousand push notifications a day of an AI saying like, "Hey, I did this thing. Do you like it? " It'd be super annoying, right? Whereas imagine, going back to software engineering, I was looking at a dashboard and I noticed some key metric had gone down. And at that point in time, an AI could maybe go take a look and then surface the fact that it has an opinion on why this metric went down and maybe a fix right there right when I'm looking at the dashboard. That would much more keep me in flow and enable the agent to take action on many more things.

(01:01:26):
So in my mind, part of why I'm excited for us to have a browser is that I think we have then much more context around what we should help with. Users have much more control over what they want us to look at. It's like, "Hey, if you want us to take action on something, you can open it in your AI browser. If you don't, then you can open it in your other browser." So really clear control and boundaries. And then we have the ability to build UX that's mixed initiatives so that we can surface contextual actions to you at the time that they're helpful as opposed to just randomly notifying you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):
Hearing the vision for Codex being the super assistant, it's not just there to code for you. It's trying to do a lot for you as a teammate, as this kind of super teammate, and that makes you awesome at work. So I get this. Speaking of that, are there other non-engineering common use cases for Codex? Just ways that non-engineers... We talked about designers prototyping and building stuff, are there any fun or unexpected ways people are using Codex that aren't engineers?

Alexander Embiricos (01:02:24):
I mean, there's a load of unexpected ways, but I think most of where we're seeing real traction with people using things are still for now very, I would say, coding adjacent or tech-oriented, places where there's a mature ecosystem or maybe you're doing data analysis or something like that. I personally am expecting that we're going to see a lot more of that over time. But for now, we're keeping the team very focused on just coding for now because there's so much more work to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):
For people that are thinking about trying out Codex, does it work for all kinds of code bases? What code does it support? If you're like, I don't know, SAP, can you add Codex and start building things? What's the sweet spot? Where does it start to not be amazing yet?

Alexander Embiricos (01:03:11):
I'm really glad you asked this question actually because the best way to try Codex is to give it your hardest tasks, which is a little different than some of the other coding agents. Some tools you might think, "Okay, let me start easy or just vibe code something random and decide if I like the tool." Whereas we're really building Codex to be the professional tool that you can give your hardest problems to. And that writes high quality code in your enormous code base that is in fact not perfect right now. So yeah, I think if you're going to try Codex, you want to try it on a real task that you have and not necessarily dumb that task down to something that's trivial, but actually a good one would be you have a hard bug and you don't know what's causing that bug and you ask Codex to help figure that out or to implement that the fix.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:00):
I love that answer. Just give it to your hardest problem.

Alexander Embiricos (01:04:03):
I will say if you're like, "Hey, okay, well, the hardest problem I have is that I need to build a new unicorn business," obviously that's not going to work. Not yet. So I think it's like give it the hardest problem, but something that is still one question or one task to start. That's if you're testing and then over time you can learn how to use it for bigger things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):
Yeah. What languages does it support?

Alexander Embiricos (01:04:27):
Basically, the way we've trained Codex is there's a distribution of languages that we support and it's fairly aligned with the frequency of these languages in the world. So unless you're writing some very esoteric language or some private language, it should do fine in your language.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:41):
If someone was just getting started, is there a tip you could share to help them be successful? If you could just whisper a little tip into someone just setting up Codex for the first time to help them have a really good time, what's something you would whisper?

Alexander Embiricos (01:04:54):
I might say try a few things in parallel. So you could try giving it a hard task, maybe ask it to understand the code base, formulate a plan with it around an idea that you have and kind of build your way up from there. And the meta idea here is, again, it's like you're building trust with a new teammate. And so you wouldn't go to a new teammate and just give them like, "Hey, do this thing. Here's zero context." You would start by first making sure they understand the code base and then you would maybe align on an approach and then you would have them go off and do bit by bit. And I think if you use Codex in that way, you'll just naturally start to understand the different ways of prompting it because it's a super powerful agent and model, but it is a little bit different to prompt Codex than other models.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):
Just a couple more questions. One, we touched on this a little bit, as AI does more and more coding, there's always this question of, "Should I learn to code and why should I spend time doing this sort of thing?" For people that are trying to figure out what to do with their career, especially if they're into software engineering computer science, do you think there's specific elements of computer science that are more and more important to lean into, maybe things they don't need to worry about? What do you think people should be leaning into skill-wise as this becomes more and more of a thing in our workplace?

Alexander Embiricos (01:06:11):
I think there's a couple angles you could go at this from. Well, the easiest one to think of at least is just be a doer of things. I think that with coding agents getting better and better over time, it's just what you can do as even someone in college or a new grad is just so much more than what that was before. And so I think you just want to be taking advantage of that. And definitely when I'm looking at hiring folks who are earlier career, it's definitely something that I think about is how productive are they using the latest tools? They should be super productive. And if you think of it in that way, they actually have less of a handicap than before versus a more senior career person because the divide is actually getting smaller because they've got these amazing coding agents now. So that's one thing, which is, I guess the advice is just learn about whatever you want, but just make sure you spend time doing things, not just fulfilling homework assignments, I guess.

(01:07:11):
I think the other side of it though is that it's still deeply worth understanding what makes a good overall software system. So I still think that skills, like really strong systems engineering skills, or even really effective communication and collaboration with your team, skills like that I think are important or are going to continue to matter for quite some time. I don't think it's going to be all of a sudden the AI coding agents are just able to build perfect systems without your help. I think it's going to look much more gradual where it's like, okay, we have these AI coding agents, they're able to validate their work. It's still important.

(01:07:51):
For example, I'm thinking of an engineer who was working on Atlas, since we were talking about it, he set up Codex so that it can verify its own work, which is a little bit non-trivial because of the nature of the Atlas project. So the way that he did that was he actually prompted Codex like, "Hey, why can't you verify your work? Fix it," and did that on a loop. And so you still, at various phases, are going to want a human in the loop to help configure the coding agent to be effective. So I think you still want to be able to reason about that. So maybe it's less important that you can type really fast and you understand exactly how to write... Not that anyone writes a 4H loop or something, or you don't need to know how to implement a specific algorithm. But I think you need to be able to reason about the different systems and what makes a software engineering team effective. So I think that's the other really important thing.

(01:08:40):
Then maybe the last angle that you could take is, I think if you're on the frontier of knowledge for a given thing, I still think that's deeply interesting to go down, partially because that knowledge is still going to be... Agents aren't going to be as good at that, but also partially because I think that by trying to advance the frontier of a specific thing, you'll actually end up being forced to take advantage of coding agents and using them to accelerate your own workflow as you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):
What's an example that when you talk about being at the frontier of something?

Alexander Embiricos (01:09:12):
Codex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training runs, the key infrastructure. We move pretty fast and so we have a Codex code review is catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually cause some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. And we're starting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex even be on call for its own training, which is pretty interesting. So there's lots there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:38):
Wait, what does that mean to be on call for its own training? So it's running, it's training and it's like, "Oh, something broke, someone needs..." And does it alert people or it's like, "Here, I'm going to fix the problem and restart"?

Alexander Embiricos (01:09:47):
This is an early idea that we're figuring out. But the basic idea is that during a training run, there's a bunch of graphs that today humans are looking at and it's really important to look at those. We call this babysitting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):
Because it's very expensive to train, I imagine, and very important to move fast and-

Alexander Embiricos (01:10:03):
Exactly. And there's a lot of systems underlying the training run. And so a system could go down or there could be an error somewhere that gets introduced. And so we might need to fix it or pause things or, I don't know, there's lots of actions we might need to take. And so basically having Codex run on a loop to evaluate how those charts are moving over time is this idea that we have to how to enable us to train way more efficiently.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:26):
I love that. And this is very much along the lines of this is the future of agents. Codex isn't just for building code, it's a lot more than that.

Alexander Embiricos (01:10:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
Okay, last question. Being at OpenAI, I can't not ask about your AGI timeline and how far you think we are from AGI. I know this isn't what you work on, but there's a lot of opinions, a lot of, I don't know, timelines. How far do you think we are from a humanly human version of AI, whatever that means to you?

Alexander Embiricos (01:10:56):
For me, I think that it's a little bit about when do we see the acceleration curves go like this? Or I don't know which way I'm mirrored here. When do we see the hockey stick? And I think that the current limiting factor, I mean, there's many, but I think a current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed on writing prompts. And like you were talking about, it's like you can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on can you go review all that code?

(01:11:29):
So my view is that we need to unblock those productivity loops from humans having to prompt and humans having to manually validate all the work. So if we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be binary. I think it's going to be very dependent on what you're building. So I would imagine that next year, if you're a startup and you're building new pieces, like some new app or something, it'll be possible for you to set it up on a stack where agents are much more self-sufficient than not. But now let's say, I don't know, you mentioned SAP, let's say you work in SAP, they have many complex systems and they're not going to be able to just get the agent to be self-sufficient overnight in those systems. So they're going to have to slowly maybe replace systems or update systems to allow the agent to handle more of the work end to end.

(01:12:22):
So basically my long answer to your question, maybe boring answer is that I think starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity. And then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies like hockey stick that productivity. And then somewhere in that fuzzy middle is when that hockey sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI tier.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
I love this answer. It's very practical and it's something that comes up a lot on this podcast. Just like the time to reveal all the things AI is doing is really annoying and a big bottleneck. I love that you're working on this because it's one thing to just make coding much more efficient and do that for people. It's another to take care of that final step of, "Okay, is this actually great?" And that's so interesting that your sense is that's the limiting factor. It comes back to your earlier point of even if AI did not advance anymore, we have so much more potential to unlock as we learn to use it more effectively. So that is a really unique answer. I haven't heard that perspective on what is the big unlock. Human typing speed to review basically what AI is doing for us. So good.

(01:13:31):
Okay, Alexander, we covered a lot of ground. Is there anything that we haven't covered? Is there anything you wanted to share, maybe double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Alexander Embiricos (01:13:43):
I think one thing is that the Codex team is growing. And as I was just saying, we're still somewhat limited by human thinking speed and human typing speed. We're working on it. So if you're an engineer or a salesperson, or I'm hiring a product person, please hit us up. I'm not sure the best way to give contact info, but I guess you can go to our jobs page, or do they have contact for you actually? Do listeners have contact for you?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:10):
Where they send me like, "Hey, I want to apply to Codex"? I do have a contact form at lennyrachitsky.com. I'm afraid of all the amazing people that are going to ping me. But there we go, we could try that. Let's see how that goes.

Alexander Embiricos (01:14:20):
Okay. Or maybe an easier version, we can edit all that out or up to you. Yeah, or I would just say you can drop us a DM. For example, I'm Embirico on Twitter, and hit me up if you're interested in joining the team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):
What a dream job for so many people. What's a sign they... I don't know, what's a way to filter people a little bit so they're not flooding your inbox?

Alexander Embiricos (01:14:42):
So specifically if you want to join the Codex team, then you need to be a technical person who uses these tools. And I think I would just ask yourself the question, "Hey, let's say I were to join OpenAI and work on Codex over the next six months and crush it, what does the life of a software engineer look like then?" And I think if you have an opinion on that, you should apply. And if you don't have an opinion on that and have to think about it first, depending on how long you have to think about it, I guess that would be the filter. I think there's a lot of people thinking about this space. So we're very interested in folks who have already been thinking about what the future should look like with agents. And we don't have to agree on where we're going, but I think we want people who are very passionate about the topic, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
It's very rare to be working on a product that has this much impact and is at such a bleeding edge of where it's possible. What a cool role for the right person. So it's awesome that you have an opening and this audience is a really good fit potentially for that role. So I hope we find someone, that would be incredible. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, Alexander. Are you ready?

Alexander Embiricos (01:15:54):
I don't know what these are, but I'm excited. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):
They're the same questions I ask everyone except for the last one. So probably not a surprise. I should probably make them more often a surprise. Okay, first question, what are a couple of books that you recommend most to other people, two or three books that come to mind?

Alexander Embiricos (01:16:12):
I have been reading a lot of science fiction recently, and I'm sure this has been recommended before, but The Culture, I think it's Ian Banks is the name of the author. Part of why I love it is because it's basically relatively recent writing about a future with AI, but it's an optimistic future with AI. And I think a lot of sci-fi is fairly dystopian. But the joke, at least on The Culture subreddit is that, let me see if I can get this right, it is a space communist utopia, or I think it's a gay space communist utopia. And I just think it's really fun to think about, to use The Culture as a way to think about what kind of world can we usher in and what decisions can we make today to help usher in that world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):
Wow. I don't think anyone's recommended that. I know you're reading, you've mentioned before I start recording, Lord of the Rings right now. If you want another AI-ish sci-fi book, have you read Fire Upon the Deep?

Alexander Embiricos (01:17:15):
No, I haven't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):
Okay, it's incredibly good. It's like a sci-fi space opera sort of epic tale with super intelligence.

Alexander Embiricos (01:17:25):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:25):
Yeah. Mostly not optimistic, but somewhat optimistic.

(01:17:30):
Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Alexander Embiricos (01:17:36):
Yeah, there's an anime called Jujutsu Kaisen, which I really like. Again, it's got a slightly dark topic of demons. But what I love about it is that the hero is really nice. And I think there's this new wave of anime and cartoons where the protagonists are really friendly and people who care about the world rather than being sort of, if you look at some older anime that started the genre, there's Evangelion or Akita and those characters, the protagonists are deeply flawed, quite unhappy. They didn't start the genre, but it was a trend for a while to poke fun at the idea that in these cartoons the protagonist was very young, but being given a ridiculous amount of responsibility to save the world. So there was kind of a wave of content that was critiquing this by making the character basically go through serious mental issues in the middle of the show. And I'm not saying this is better, but at least it's quite fun to have these really positive protagonists are just trying to help everyone around them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:43):
I love how much we're learning about your personality hearing these recommendations. Nice protagonists, optimistic futures. I like the [inaudible 01:18:53].

Alexander Embiricos (01:18:53):
I think if you don't believe it, you can't will it into existence. So you need a balance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:57):
This is your training data.

(01:18:59):
Is there a product you recently discovered you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be some kitchen gadget, tech gadget, a hat.

Alexander Embiricos (01:19:09):
Yeah, so I have been quite into combustion engines and cars. Actually, the reason I came to America initially was because I wanted to work on US aircraft, but now I work in software. And so for the longest time, I've basically only had quite old sports cars, old just because they were more affordable. And then recently we got a Tesla instead. And I have to say that I find the Tesla software quite inspiring. In particular, it has the self-driving feature. And I've mentioned a few times today, I think it's really interesting to think about how to build mixed initiative software that makes you feel maximally empowered as a human, maximally in control, but yet you're getting a lot of help. And I think they did a really good job with enabling the car to drive itself, but all these different ways that you can adjust what it's doing without turning off the self-driving. So you can accelerate, it'll listen to that. You can turn a knob to change its speed. You can steer slightly. I think it's actually a masterclass in building an agent that still leaves the human in control.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):
This reminds me Nick Turley's whole mantra is, "Are we maximally accelerated?"

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Feels like it's completely infiltrated everything at OpenAI, which makes sense, that tracks.

(01:20:32):
Two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often think about and come back to in work or in life that's been helpful?

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:39):
I don't know if I have a life motto, but maybe I can tell you about the number one company value from my startup.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):
Love it.

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:46):
Which is still something that sticks with me, which is to be kind and candid.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:51):
That tracks. Kind and candid. Wow, that's a great combo.

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:54):
Yeah. And we had to put them together because we, as founders, realized that we often would be nice and it wasn't actually the right thing to do. We would delay the difficult conversations and we were not candid. And so every time we would remind ourselves of this motto and then we would become more candid. And then six months later, we would realize that we were in fact not candid six months ago and we needed to be even more candid. So then the question is like, "Okay, how should we be candid?" It's like, "Okay, well, let's think of being candid as an act of kindness," but also think of that both in terms of doing it and willing ourselves to do it, but also in terms of how we frame it as people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:32):
That is a beautiful way of summarizing how to lead well. What's the book about challenge directly but care deeply? Radical Candor.

Alexander Embiricos (01:21:43):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):
So it's like another way of thinking about Radical Candor.

(01:21:46):
Okay, last question. I was looking up your last name just like, "Hey, what's the story here?" So your last name is Embiricos, and I was talking at ChatGPT and it told me the most famous individuals with the surname are the influential Greek poet and psychoanalyst Andreas Embiricos and his relative, the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector, George Embiricos. So the question is, which of these two do you most identify with, the Greek poet and psychoanalyst or the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector?

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:19):
I think it's going to have to be the poet because he loved the island that our family's from.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):
Wait, you know those people? Okay, this is not news to you. Okay.

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:30):
Well, I mean, it's an enormous family. But it's like Greek, so these big families, everyone's your uncle.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):
Love this. Okay.

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:36):
You know what I mean? My mother's Malaysian and also everyone is my uncle or aunt in Malaysia too, if that makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
Yeah.

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:43):
But yeah, he loved this island that the family initiated from. I believe, I don't actually know where that's shipping magnate lived, I think it was New York or something. But anyway, we all came from this island called Andros, which is a really beautiful place. And it's like there's more livestock there than humans. Not too many tourists go there. But I think part of what I think is really cool is he published a lot and a lot of his writing is about the beauty of that island, which I think is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:12):
Wow, that was an amazing answer.

(01:23:14):
Two more questions, where can folks find you if they want to follow you online and maybe reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Alexander Embiricos (01:23:20):
I'm one of those people who has social media only for the purposes of having work. My phone turns black and white at 9:00 PM at night. But yeah, so Twitter or X, @Embirico. And yeah, if you post in r/Codex, I'll probably see it. So you can go there.

(01:23:40):
How can listeners be useful? I would say please try Codex, please share feedback, let us know what to improve. We pay a ton of attention to feedback. I think, honestly, the growth has been amazing, but it's still very early times, so we still pay a lot of attention and hope to do so forever. And also, I would say if you're interested in working on the future of coding agents and then agents generally, then please apply to our job site and/or message me in those social media places.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:10):
Alexander, this was awesome. I always love meeting people working on AI because it always feels like this very, I don't know, sterile, scary, mysterious thing. And then you meet the people building these tools and they're always just so awesome, and you especially, just so nice. And like the examples you shared, optimism and kindness, this is what we want to be. These are the kinds of people we want to be building these tools that are going to drive the future. So I'm really thankful that you did this. I'm grateful to have met you, and thank you so much for being here.

Alexander Embiricos (01:24:45):
Yeah, thanks so much for having me. This was fun.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Boz, the CTO of Meta, said something about you. "Working with Ami, she could have the most profound disagreement in the world and she would respond, fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that."

Ami Vora (00:00:09):
I really enjoy being right and then it turns out in the working world, that did not serve me so great. I think the hard part is sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
I love this very tactical piece of advice when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product.

Ami Vora (00:00:27):
If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday, then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
There's also this metaphor about the hill climb.

Ami Vora (00:00:38):
For me, the hill climb is all about the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever, but then, way off in the distance you can see a mountain. And the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Today, my guest is Ami Vora. Ami is Chief Product Officer at Faire, which connects independent retailers and brands around the world, and I believe is the most successful and biggest B2B marketplace startup out there. Prior to Faire, Ami was employee 150 at Facebook, where she launched the first Facebook developer platform and was later head of product for the $55 billion global Facebook ads business. She also oversaw the introduction of ads on the Instagram platform and most recently, she led product and design for the largest messaging app in the world, WhatsApp.

(00:01:34):
In our conversation we cover a lot of ground, including building your strategy skills, how to disagree with people skillfully, being a successful woman in tech, using metaphors and imagery to rally your team and get your point across, setting up effective goals, plus a bunch of jokes in the lightning round that you don't want to miss. This was a really special and authentic conversation that I'm very excited to bring to you. With that, I bring you, Ami Vora.

(00:02:03):
Ami, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Ami Vora (00:02:06):
Oh, thank you. I'm so happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):
So, when I asked you about your goal for our conversation today, you said the most amazing thing, which I love. You said that your goal is to be as authentic as possible and to show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I love that so much. Let's definitely try to do this. Is there anything else you want to add on that?

Ami Vora (00:02:28):
Yeah, I mean, maybe I'll just say a couple more words on that. Actually, I feel like when I was coming up, when I looked at people who were successful, they seemed to have everything figured out, especially the women. They were all super women, where they respond to every email in 10 seconds, they didn't seem to sleep, they always wore high heels. They were just perfect and I was just like, oh, I guess I'm never going to be successful. That is not me. I love to sleep, I waste time doing absurd things all the time.

(00:03:00):
And I'll tell you how glamorous my lifestyle is, I'm currently working out of my bathroom. I'm talking to you from my bathroom, which is where I work from because I love my house, it's a great house, wasn't meant for work from home, three kids, two parents remote work, and it was just the place with the most closing doors between me and my children when the pandemic started. And so it just took me a while to realize that actually, it's all fine. No one's got it fully figured out, you never know how someone else is living. Most of us are winging it and learning as we're going and learning through trial and error and it's all normal. It's all fine and I can do it and you can do it, and everyone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):
I so love hearing this. This is something people often want to hear more of on this podcast, because there's all these stories of here's all these successes, here's all these things I did and everything, it just always seems to work out. And we try to, we have this failure corner on the podcast where people share story failure. So I love just setting that frame for this conversation of just super being real and being clear that there's a lot of things that go wrong behind the scenes that people often don't hear about.

Ami Vora (00:04:08):
I for a long time felt like I was held back because I don't have a plan, but I realized that probably the most important thing is to just acknowledge that that is true for me. That I'm not going to be a person with a plan, and actually the thing that has consistently served me is to do the thing that feels right, go to the place that feels like home, work with the people who feel like my friends. Just work where when I put on the code of the job, I feel like, oh, this is a place where I could really be lucky, I could be creative, I'm in the right spot, as opposed to feeling like, oh, there is an end state that I know of and I'm just going to have to work my way to that end state. Whenever I get in that zone of, there's only one outcome and I just have to get there, I'm not my best. I'm not bringing the creativity and the luck and the excitement in the same way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:03):

This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents, fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams, and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.

(00:07:00):
Most product managers will tell you, paperwork sucks. Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature.

(00:07:29):
The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides.

(00:07:55):
Let's actually spend some more time here. I wasn't planning to go here yet, but this is really great and important advice. I've just, basically you're saying that a lot of your success has come from following people that are awesome. Can you just talk more about that, just what it is you've followed and seen that has helped you land in places that have worked out so well, because clearly you've done incredibly well.

Ami Vora (00:08:14):
I mean, I think a lot of us are just like, you have a spreadsheet in your head of the axes and certainly when you're choosing between jobs, for me it feels like, oh man, the rest of my career hangs in the balance of making the exact right decision and getting the exact right job. And you work through all of this spreadsheet mass of, if I took this job, here's what it would do for me, here's where I'd be in five years, etc. And I have that engine in my head also, but what I try to do is work through the spreadsheets and then tear it up because none of that stuff is actually going to determine how good I am at the job. The thing that'll determine... In my track record, the thing that has determined it is when I walk through the doors, do I feel like I'm lucky to be there?

(00:09:03):
So for me, it's actually a lot more emotional. I try to just put on the coat of the job. When I wake up in the morning, I'm like, what would it be like if I were doing this job? What would I think about on my commute? Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them? What problems am I going to solve today? And that gives me an emotional response, which is just much more telling than the spreadsheets of, here's where I'm going to be in five years.

(00:09:31):
And for me, the thing that has led me to the places where I do my best work is a feeling of being at home, which is all about trust and trust with the people around me. Can I walk through and feel like these people are going to have my back, they're going to let me take risks, I'm going to enjoy spending time with them? And that's where I feel like I've always just been able to try more things and do better because a big, trust is a big unlock for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):
I love this metaphor of putting on the coat of the job, of just feeling out what it would be to work there. I imagine that was something that you did before you joined Faire, which I want to talk about, but let me transition a bit to talking about Meta and specifically, Boz. The CTO of Meta was on this podcast a few months ago and he said something about you that I want to read.

Ami Vora (00:10:17):
Oh, kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):
Okay, so you've heard what he said about you?

Ami Vora (00:10:21):
[inaudible 00:10:21].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:20):
Okay, cool. So let me read this and then I want to learn from you how to do this. So here's what he said. "Working with Ami, it was like watching an alien because she could have the most profound disagreement in the world with somebody and they would say something that she thought was not just wrong, but crazy wrong, and she would respond, 'Fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.' And she meant it from the core of her being. She saw this schism and rather than reacting as if it was a threat, she reacted with the most genuine and profound curiosity. I just watched it absolutely tear down walls between points of view. Embracing curiosity in those moments of challenges completely changed my life and I owe that to Ami Vora."

Ami Vora (00:10:58):
Oh man, I love Boz, what a great guy, and so kind of him to say that. I mean, I will say that this did not come naturally to me. I really enjoy being right, I love to be right. I think most of us love being right, and at least in my childhood, part of my identity was built on being the person who was right and being the person who knew everything.

(00:11:22):
And then it turns out that in the working world, that did not serve me so great, it wasn't great to walk into things and be like, all y'all are wrong, I am the only answer, everyone please to listen to me and stop talking. And what really happened was that someone pointed out to me that not only... One of my old managers pointed out to me that not only was I spending a lot of energy trying to think through every possible thing by myself so I could be totally right, I was often not really coming to the right answer. Other people have a bunch of information that I do not have. And so I'm just ignoring that, I was letting my ego overtake my desire to get to the best outcome, which is just, that's a silly trade off and an unnecessary one.

(00:12:12):
The thing that changed there is me just saying it's more important for us to get to the outcome and I very selfishly just like to learn more things. And so by deciding that I already knew everything, I was cutting myself off from learning the things that other people were really good at and it's so easy to just open the door instead and say like, hey, you seem to know something that I don't know yet. Why not tell me about it? I'm going to get better. We'll probably come to the right outcome. Maybe you'll have a better time. Why not?

(00:12:45):
And so it was a little bit just accidental evolution in that direction. But it's made work and life so much more interesting to just be like, hey, what does this person know that I don't know yet? It means that every meeting you walk into, you're probably not going to get bored and I get bored a lot, but if you assume that every person there knows something that you don't know, then it's not just wait to get to the right answer, it's like, discover the thing that they know that you don't know and it becomes just a little bit of uncovering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
For people that want to learn to be good at this the way you are, a couple things that I take away from the historian and the way you're talking about this is, one is there's an enthusiasm of, I disagree with you, but I want you to know I really care about what you think. So there's an energy of like, please tell me what I'm missing. There's also this assumption that a lot of disagreement is rooted in, we just have different information, so tell me what I'm missing. Can you talk a bit about just how to, what you've learned about actually do this well?

Ami Vora (00:13:45):
Yeah, I mean, I think the hard part is just sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right. And I think all of growth is a battle with yourself, but this is one of the hardest ones because we all want to be right, we all want to protect ourselves and it served us, many of us for so long to be right. I just try to think about the feedback loop of, I think all of life is feedback loops, so I just started to think about the feedback loop I'm creating of like, I was curious about something. I learned something new, we got for a better outcome. Probably the other person felt better as well as I felt better. It's all positive feedback and you do that a couple of times and the positive feedback far outweighs the desire to be right because now we're more right, we're more right together. And so just building that as a practice of just noticing how much better things can get when you can be open to them, has been really fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:43):
What do you think of this phrase that he used that he remembers? Is that a phrase that you find useful? Just fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.

Ami Vora (00:14:52):
I do think that is a word that I say a lot. I do say that a lot, because it's true, it's fascinating that someone to look at the same movie that I was looking at and come away with a totally different understanding of the plot. I could sit in the same meeting as other people and they would leave with just a different retelling of what happened, and that to me is fascinating. Isn't that surprising, that we can all see the same, what we think are the same facts and walk away with a totally different narrative? And when you really go deep into that and you just understand how people see the world, and that is helpful. I'm curious about things, I like to know more things, and so that just helps me know more things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:36):
I feel like the hardest part of this for people is you hear someone say something, say, okay, so our mutual friend, Dan Hockenmaier, he's in a meeting and he just says something that you are just like, no, because he's got influence. He's a big deal at Faire. Most people have this visceral reaction of like, oh no, I really don't think that's a good idea. Is there something you've learned about controlling that bodily reaction of like, oh, and then just being positive about it?

Ami Vora (00:16:00):
Yeah, I do think it is just that feedback loop. It's not like I don't have the visceral reaction, it's just that instead of interpreting it as this is a visceral reaction, I got to shut something down, it's like, this is a visceral reaction and it's a chance to learn more. Just reinterpreting some of the feelings in ways that are more about opening than about closing stuff down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):
Got it, so it's kind of like a thinking you do of like, okay, hey, let me frame this and think about this [inaudible 00:16:28].

Ami Vora (00:16:28):
For me the most important thing is just taking a pause. I think when you just take a pause, your body calms down, your mind gets a chance to breathe a little bit, and then your response is going to be better, but you got to take the pause because the immediate visceral reaction, is not always... It's going to be primal, it's going to be protective. It's just when you take a pause you're like, this is all fine, let's just learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:52):
I feel like more people are going to start using this phrase, fascinating.

Ami Vora (00:16:55):
Fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:56):
When they hear something [inaudible 00:16:58].

Ami Vora (00:16:57):
It's kind of my tagline. There were a few years where I had to be careful about not saying it because whenever I said it, people would be like, she disagrees. So I've had to use a thesaurus and expand my words I use.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):
No, that's such a good word. Maybe we'll make that the title of this episode.

Ami Vora (00:17:12):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:16):
What a great title that would be. So we've been talking a bit about the bodily reaction to stuff and our lizard brain almost, reacting to things. It reminds me of this metaphor that you called the dinosaur brain and how it applies to product reviews. Talk about what that is.

Ami Vora (00:17:31):
Okay, so a lot of people on my team, they're coming in to do product reviews and they're worried about it. They're stressed out, they don't exactly know what to show, and the normal temptation is just to show as much information as possible because that way you come in and you think, hey, the people in this room are super smart. I'll show them the information, they will come to the right conclusions. They'll probably make a better decision than I'm going to make. So my job is to catalog the information and present it.

(00:17:59):
And one of the first things that I talk to people about is, okay, for the purposes of this conversation, I'm going to put myself in the capitally executive bucket because that makes what I'm about to say less offensive. Assume that executives have a little tiny dinosaur brain. We all have a little brontosaurus brain and we can really only hold three facts at the same time. We will never be able to go deep in the way that you are able to do on everything that crosses our desk. And so the best service you can do is actually do the work of making a recommendation. That's the way we're going to be complimentary. The breadth that I normally have to look across means that I'm going to be better at things like pattern matching or giving you more context or telling you stuff that's happening in the company or the industry. But what I'm not going to be better at is looking at all the information that you looked at and coming up with a meaningful outcome. That's what you're going to do and my little dinosaur brain is going to be like, okay, that sounds like a very reasonable pattern, I've seen other patterns that look like this. Okay, that sounds like an outcome, however, it conflicts with this outcome over here. I can tell you about that. Does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:17):
Yeah, and I love that you put yourself in that bucket. You have a dinosaur brain also, it's not other people.

Ami Vora (00:19:22):
It's a pretty bad, bad look, but it's really true. As you get more breadth, you are less and less able to go deep on everything that deserves going deep and you just end up doing a different service than the people on your team, and recognizing that as complimentary has been really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):
You have this phrase, my manager owns context, I own the recommendation. Kind of along the same lines?

Ami Vora (00:19:42):
Exactly, very similar. And I think the thing that was helpful for me there is that really unlocked what I was looking for from my managers because otherwise I wanted them to be exactly like me. If I assume that I need to bring them information and then they would come to the same conclusion that I would come to, that's very narrow. They have to be able to look at the exact same information and process it in the same way and come out with the same idea. Whereas if what they're doing is complimentary to me, then I can learn from everyone. They're going to just have a different view, they're going to have new information that I don't have, and it gives me a lot more space to take accountability.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):
Is there any other advice that you could share along these lines of just product reviews? So, the big takeaway here is just keep it simple and have a recommendation.

Ami Vora (00:20:30):
Keep it simple, have a recommendation. I also think that, I think we misuse product reviews sometimes as ways to get decisions and actually, they should be ways to calibrate on principles. So what you don't want is to come to a product review for every single that you want to make. Instead, what you want is to come to a product review with one decision, but the goal of that decision is to walk out with principles about how to make these decisions in the future so that you don't have to come to product review, but you still have this consistent and coherent product that you're building.

(00:21:04):
And so I think when you flip the frame of reviews to being less about, okay, I'm going to bring this information to an exec, my manager, whoever, and they're going to decide every piece, you're not actually building that much more capacity in the system. You're getting fast decision making, but you're not changing who can make really good decisions. And I think you always want to change the org to constantly make better decisions, and a way to do that is when you bring these sorts of questions, what you talk about is, why did you make this decision? What are the trade-offs you have in mind? Who are you optimizing for? What timeline are you thinking about? What's the risk level we're willing to tolerate? And then you don't have to come back. You have enough information that you can take those principles and run with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
Is there a framework or a process you use for product reviews that might be helpful for people to hear? Just like a agenda or a way of thinking about just how to set up a product review for success? Because a lot of people are trying to set these up at their companies and they're like, I don't know if we're doing this optimally.

Ami Vora (00:22:05):
Yeah, I think everyone's got... I think there's so many different takes on frameworks. I don't have a single system. I mean, actually I think Boz has written about a bunch of this, and I probably most agree with him. Where there's different kinds of product reviews, it's like, what are you trying to solve? What's the timeline on which you're thinking about for these? Is it a philosophy? Is it a strategic shift? Is it a day-to-day product decision? And then keeping it extremely short and pointed and then making sure you walk away with principles, not answers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:36):
I think there's a lot of nuance and importance there of what you just said, which is start with the problem you're solving. What are we trying to do here? And the timeline, I think that's also really useful and important for people to hear.

Ami Vora (00:22:47):
I think the temptation is always to err toward writing more, and what I always really recommend people do is write whatever you need to write and then cut out almost all of it. What you really want to bring to any forum, whether it's a product review or a written inform or anything else, is the minimal amount of information that you need to make a clean recommendation because then you are forced to be opinionated. Otherwise, the opinion can get lost in all of this information. You can hide behind, well, all of these analyses seem to suggest, and instead you should probably just say, looked at all the data, there's three analyses that suggest this. There's one that suggests that, we think that one is inaccurate or worth taking the risk on. Let's go. Any objections? Let me know. Any new context? Let me know. That really forces you to deeply understand and take an opinion on the material.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):
Final question, who do you like to invite to these product reviews and your thoughts, rules, policy?

Ami Vora (00:23:50):
Yeah, I mean I do think that usually fewer people is better. It leads to a sense of being informal and that is really useful because it lowers the bar on how complete or strong these conversations are and I'd rather have a less formal conversation faster than a formal conversation and lose three weeks in the process when we could have been building. I think it needs to be cross-functional. I think one of the things you want is cross-functional accountability. So we want it cross-functional at the leadership level and cross-functional at the team presenting level. And I think those are normally the groups.

(00:24:25):
I think the thing that gets hard is you often cut out the middle, where if it's a working team presenting to the senior leaders on something important, it's really hard because it means people's managers are not in the room and can't help the conversation or other things. And so in order to do that, you have to really have a bunch of implicit trust inside the team that everyone will get the context later, that everyone's going to be kind to everyone else and you don't need a ton of air cover, and that the managers trust their team to present in the best possible way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
That is always a stressful place for a manager to be, where their success is riding in that meeting and they're not there and they-

Ami Vora (00:25:07):
It's so stressful, it's so stressful. I think anything you do to make it less stressful is useful. But then there've also been times in my career where I would keep the room itself small, but because we were all trying to calibrate on specific principles, I would record or broadcast the reading to anyone who wanted to see it, just so they could all see the principles by which we were decision-making and get calibrated on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):
So through your career you've transitioned from being the person pitching the products and being reviewed to the person reviewing and being on the other side. Is there anything being on this side of it that you think is helpful for people earlier in their career to know about that experience, from your angle now?

Ami Vora (00:25:53):
I mean, I think for what it's worth, I think I still do a fair amount of product pitching in the past few years because there's always someone else to convince.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
That's true.

Ami Vora (00:26:01):
Especially if you want to do something dramatically different. Really, I think the biggest service for people who are starting out a little earlier is that point around bringing the recommendation, really having the opinion and standing behind it with conviction and doing what they need to do to build that conviction for themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
Awesome. You've done this a number of times already in this conversation, and so I want to spend a little time here, which is using metaphors and imagery to make your point and get people to understand what you're trying to say. So you have this code of putting on the coat of the job and this dinosaur brain, and so someone told me that this is just a skill you have where you use metaphor and imagery to rally a team, get your point across, get people to understand what you're trying to say. There's also this metaphor, someone told me I need to ask you about the hill climb metaphor. Does that ring a bell?

Ami Vora (00:26:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:53):
Okay, what is that all about?

Ami Vora (00:26:55):
For me, the hill climb is all about the difference between the local optimum and a global optimum. That sounds very abstract, but I think a lot of the time when we're doing our job, when we're doing life stuff, whatever you're doing, you try to just get better and better and you optimize your current system and then you feel really good about it, and that is great. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see the, I don't know, rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever. But then way off from the distance you can see a mountain, one that's even higher than you can't even see the top of it, and you have to decide, are you going to take the risk of climbing down your hill, crossing an unknown chasm, and then climbing back up, just to get to the same level you started at with more climbing to do to get to that summit? And that is really hard.

(00:27:51):
I'm thinking of things like, maybe the first time I saw this was like a lot of companies were really good at desktop and you could see the mobile mountain way out over there, but to get there you had to really make a lot of trade-offs in your core desktop business that you were not totally sure were going to pay off when you made it to the mobile mountain, and you had to do a ton of work. You had to fundamentally rewire a lot of what you're doing without a guarantee that you're going to get there. I mean, you can see it in life when you think about new jobs or new moves or new relationships, anything that you think about. You are giving up something that is working pretty well without knowing whether you're going to make it to the top of that next mountain. And that's been really helpful to me just to place where I am on different things, where you get the inkling that there is a much better way to do this, there really is.

(00:28:48):
Is it going to be worth going down into the valley, climbing up, keeping climbing? Is that going to be worth it? Most of the time the answer is yes, but it's helpful for me to know, boy, this feels like a slog. It is supposed to? Because I'm still in the valley and the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like. When you're on top of it and you're like, this is great, it was absolutely worth it. My life is better in these ways, we're able to solve these problems in these ways. It was worth it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:19):
I love that. It feels like a big value of the metaphor, which I love is that to set expectations, it's going to be really hard for a little bit or we will slow down what we're trying to do now, but the idea is there's a bigger hill and a bigger mountain.

Ami Vora (00:29:32):
It's a bigger hill and it's worth it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):
On this kind of broader idea of metaphors and imagery, is there something there that you've learned of just like, this works really well, I'm going to invest in becoming better at this, or is this something that's come natural to you? Anything you can share about that skill and approach?

Ami Vora (00:29:46):
I think this one came from, I worked for a manager, his name was Eric Antino, and he was just a master of the metaphor and analogies. And so whenever I would bring him something, he would be like, how is this product going to make you feel, and when is the last time that you felt this way? And you can say, oh, I felt this way when I was hanging with my friends in Dolores Park and he'd be like, cool, tell me what it feels like, why that's the analogy, what ramifications come out of that?

(00:30:18):
And one thing I like to do is try to build an emulator for different people in my head, because I've just had the good fortune of working with an amazing number of very different leaders, and so he's one of the people I tried to build an emulator for where I'd be like, okay, I see this thing. I don't know how to solve this problem. How would Eric describe this? I've tried to build one for Boz, which is all about principle of decision making and principle of trade-offs. There's a few other people where I'm like, I don't know how to solve this problem. Can I load this other person into my head and how would they approach it? And that gives me a fresh lens on it.

(00:30:55):
And I really like metaphors and analogies because I think especially as you scale a team, narrative becomes increasingly important. Narrative can carry so much weight and water where otherwise it's similar to the product review point, where either you can tell everybody exactly what to do at every point or you can create a story that we all agree on. And when we all agree on that story, people just know better what to do. If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday. You know what the iconography, the designers know what iconography should look like. You know what the communication and join pattern should look like. You're not going to build something cold and corporate, you're not going to build something strobe light, you're not going to build something flashy, but you don't have to go and make all those individual decisions. You can buy into the same story and then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):
This is such a powerful and important skill. Is there an example that comes to mind where you did this really well, say at WhatsApp or Facebook of the story that carried a lot of water for you and the team?

Ami Vora (00:32:08):
Yeah, I mean I think the product metaphor we arrived at for WhatsApp was face-to-face communication. Our goal there was to make it so that every person in the world could feel connected to the people they cared most about, even when they were separate, even they're distant geographically for whatever reason, we were always going to be apart from the people you cared about. And we really had to build something that would work for literally everyone in the world. People who are carrying these high-end devices in western markets who are very tech comfortable and savvy, and people in the low end markets who were carrying these low end devices, they weren't that familiar with technology, it was maybe their first time online. We had to build something that worked for everyone.

(00:32:57):
And the most universal form of communication is face-to-face. When you talk to someone face-to-face, you're not thinking, how do I present? What tool do I have to learn? You just open your mouth and words come out, and that's the feeling that we wanted to create. And that involved a lot of the app stepping back from communication, creating spaces that felt really intimate so people wouldn't have to think to themselves, what kind of space am I in? They could immediately map where they were in the app to the, okay, I'm sitting around in my kitchen table and people are joining and leaving calls just like they're walking in and out of my living room, but it is a family space and the family is there. Or, in one-on-one disappearing messages, you're like, cool, this is my close friend. We don't need to keep track of everything that we're saying. We're here for a little bit of banter, a little bit of relationship, a little bit of quick, what's your wifi password and stuff, and whatever's really important, that's what we'll hold onto and the rest is just day-to-day, normal intimacy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):
That is super interesting. WhatsApp, one of the main differentiators and benefits is it's super fast. And I see completely how it connects this idea of you're just like, ideas, we want you to feel like you're talking to someone.

Ami Vora (00:34:09):
And it's all really a small thing. It's like a typing indicator is like someone who's about to take a breath, give them a second to talk, the two check marks lighting up or someone's face lighting up when they hear you, it's just a recognition of being heard. These are all super small things, but I think they add up to a feeling of being there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
That is super interesting. So I love this very tactical piece of advice that you just shared of just when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product and when else have they felt that same feeling? So interesting. And then this other point you made of making this emulator of a person in your head.

Ami Vora (00:34:49):
I mean, it sounds a little wild now that I think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):
No.

Ami Vora (00:34:51):
That's robotic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:52):
It makes total sense.

Ami Vora (00:34:55):
I get very bored a lot. It's another way to make sure meetings are really interesting where you're like, okay, let me see what that person is going to say next. Let me put myself in their shoes. Let me think about what they're reacting to and why they're going to think that and how they're going to see the world. And again, it just gives me more toolkits because it means when I'm stumped on something, I can be like, what would Rob Goldman say? He'd say, look at the dashboard. Have I looked at the dashboard? No. Okay, let me go look at the dashboard. You can load up these different skillsets that people have been so generous with sharing with me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:28):
What would be the Ami emulator? What are people thinking when they loaded it?

Ami Vora (00:35:33):
Fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:33):
Fascinating?

Ami Vora (00:35:35):
Fascinating, probably the number one, no joke.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:37):
Is there an emulator you most often come back to that you find most useful in just in your day-to-day? Who's the person that like, oh yeah-

Ami Vora (00:35:44):
I think those are the three. I think it is like Antino's story. Story, metaphor, analogy creation. I think it's like Boz's, if we played this out, what principles are we using? And if we kept on using those principles, what would happen? And it is Rob Goldman, who's an amazing metrics growth product leader being like, look at the dashboard. I mean, look at the dashboard, which is a great central rooting part of my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:16):
This was so fascinating, fascinating.

Ami Vora (00:36:19):
It revs up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):
I love this topic of just metaphors and stories and visions and things like that. It's something that a lot of people are wanting to get better at. Is there another example, per chance, that you could share of maybe using a metaphor to rally team, get things done?

Ami Vora (00:36:34):
I mean, I think taking a sub part of WhatsApp or when we talk about video calling. I really, one the metaphors was sitting around in your family room when you think about how to make calls work, where when you're sitting in a family room, you're not scheduling it, you're not, I don't know, having this cold corporate feeling, the way you do with a conference where there's heavyweight interactions, and instead there's just, you can join and leave. It feels lightweight, it feels like the space exists even when you're not there. And so just creating things like joinable calls, like that feeling of people popping in and just paying attention to whoever's there and letting them leave, but the call can flow on without a super heavyweight action that everyone needs to take. I think that was another one where we were just able to agree on the feeling and then you know what to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
I was just using WhatsApp to do video call with my mom. They were traveling to Italy and so-

Ami Vora (00:37:30):
That's great, that's exactly [inaudible 00:37:33].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:32):
I experienced it, it felt great.

(00:37:35):
Let me go in a slightly different direction. One of my favorite posts of yours is called execution beats strategy every time, and I think another way you phrase it is, execution eats strategy for breakfast. I think you put that somewhere. I'd love to hear about this because I completely agree. I think a lot of people obsess with strategy and vision and got to get this right and forget that most of the work is execution. So yeah, I'd love to hear just your take and insight here.

Ami Vora (00:37:58):
Yeah, I don't know if I coined execution eats strategy for breakfast, I think a lot of things eat other things for breakfast, but I'm a believer. I do think execution eats strategy for breakfast and that's something we used to say a lot at Meta. It was just the most important part and I was well-trained in that. That was one of the key lessons that I learned there, and it's because when you have... Look, strategy is super fun. You get to think about all this pie in the sky stuff. You get to think about if the world operated in rational patterns and you could predict the future, what is going to be the second and third order effect? You get to use your brain in a really fun, philosophical way, but customers don't care. Customers don't care about your fancy strategies and your five-year plan. They care about the product that's in their hands. And so anything that distracts you from thinking about the product in your hands I think, or maybe worse, takes you away from solving customer's problems today, I think is a distraction.

(00:39:03):
And I think one of the things that you learn is if you have great strategy, perfect strategy but poor execution, you don't win because your strategy never makes it to the market. And what's even worse is that you have learned nothing. You don't know whether it was your strategy that was wrong or whether it was your execution that was wrong, all you know is you didn't win. Whereas when you have a pretty good strategy, a good enough strategy, you're in the right direction and you have perfect execution, you still don't win immediately, but you know your execution was great. So then you learn, what do you need to do to improve your strategy? You've got the execution machine, you go back, you update your strategy, you relaunch, and you keep on doing it until your strategy is perfect and then you do win. And that's the lesson I repeatedly learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:50):
Is this advice a reaction to what you said, where people, PMs let's say, are just like, I want to work on strategy, we got to spend all this time, get the strategy nailed, and it's just like, okay, we also need to execute and that's maybe even more important.

Ami Vora (00:40:02):
Yeah, I do think it's very glamorous to work on strategy. It's so fun. It's so fun to have the word strategy in your [inaudible 00:40:11]. I don't know, we've built a mythology around strategy being the most important thing. And execution is not glamorous, it is not like white-boarding by yourself and pointing to things and coming out with the grand vision. It is the nuts and bolts and sometimes boring, sometimes grind it out work of like, you got to bring the donuts, you got to look at the dashboards, you got to rewrite the spec. You got to just do a bunch of the grinding, but that is what leads to the customer's outcomes. That is what the customer is eventually going to feel. They're never going to see the whiteboard, they're going to see that someone took the time to fix this bug.

Is this advice you give to your PMs on your teams? I guess, how do you think about this when they're trying to move up the ranks, become better product managers? Is this just a common thing that you often share, like yeah, strategy is going to be amazing, important. You got to get good at it, but also make sure this is going great.

Ami Vora (00:41:57):
Yeah, I think about it a little bit in terms of proportion of time you should expect to spend. So I mean, there's no point next being on that strategy, you can't have a bad strategy. So you should spend some time, maybe it's like 20% of your time, but the bulk of your time should be confirming that strategy actually makes sense for the customers. Getting it out there, building the machine to constantly make it better, as opposed to a perfect strategy. You go away, you build it for a year, you ship it, the market has changed. Customers have changed, their needs have changed, competition, just the whole landscape has changed and you probably could have solved those problems more easily had you headed in the right direction, but done it with more ongoing customer feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:39):
In terms of this proportion, I imagine what you see is as you get more senior, more of your time spent on strategy, less time on execution, right?

Ami Vora (00:42:46):
I don't 100% know that that's true. I think again, even at high levels, maybe the strategic directions become more important to get mostly right, but I think still most of your time is making sure they can make it to market. I think you should still be spending your time understanding what's slowing people down and unblocking it. Understanding, how is the market changing? Understanding what the broad customer feedback is, just constantly improving the system that you are building. I think that's, I mean, how much time can you spend thinking about the future, as opposed to actually trying to create it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:29):
That is really interesting advice because I think most people imagine as you get more senior, I'm going to have more time thinking about vision and strategy, not have to be in the weeds building things. And I love this point you're making of even as a senior exec, you're still, it's executing in a different way, but it's still execution.

Ami Vora (00:43:44):
A different way, yeah. You're focusing on the execution of the system a little bit more, but you got to stay connected, I think, to the customer and to what you're bringing to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:54):
I love that. Obviously, strategy is also very important. You have this great quote that I'm going to read here. "For strategy to be useful, it actually has to change our behavior as a team to create better customer outcomes." Can you talk about that?

Ami Vora (00:44:08):
Yeah. I mean, I think again, some of the joy of strategy is the philosophy and excitement of thinking about all the long-term stuff that will happen, but I try to always come back to, what's going to change for the customer? If we have all of these conversations and we come out with this shiny five-year plan, but then we change nothing about the products that we're building or how we are building, what was the point of that exercise? It made us feel good, and there's something to making us feel good. That is good, it's important for teams to feel good and connected and this is a good exercise for that, but it's so much more powerful when it's an exercise that translates into us doing something differently, whether that's prioritizing different products, whether that's changing our portfolio allocation, like moving people to the things we think are most important now versus things that are going to be less important right now. What's the change, or coming out with a strategy that'll align people because we have the story, we have the narrative, we have the sequence. What's going to change for our customers as a result of this strategy exercise?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):
Many people want to get better at strategy. Often their performance feedback is become more strategic, think better about strategy. What has helped you become a better strategic thinker? Is it just doing it? Is it a person that influenced you heavily? Is it a book? What has helped you and what do you often recommend to people to get better at this skill?

Ami Vora (00:45:30):
I think I got that same feedback quite a lot, actually, of needing to think bigger and be more visionary, etc. And I still do, frankly, actually, there's moments where I retrench way too far into execution and worry a little less about long-term strategy. So it's definitely my bias still.

(00:45:49):
The biggest thing that held me back from talking about strategy was I didn't feel confident that I knew enough to declare a strategy. It was actually almost like a self-confidence, imposter syndrome thing, where there were people who could just say, I know how the world is going to develop in the next five years, and let me tell you, here's where we're going to be, this is the dot on the map. And I was always like, how could anything could happen? Who would I be to say I know how the world's going to develop and here's where we're heading?

(00:46:21):
And so for me, a lot of it was actually learning the things that made me feel confident in my own opinion. And there's a bunch of things that do make me feel confident in my opinion. When I talk to specific customers and I feel like I can build an emulator for them, like a customer on my shoulder where I can say, oh, I talked to this person working in this job, here's what they would say if I showed them this product or this strategy. So, I think talking to customers is a big unlock for me and feeling like I have unique knowledge of the customer. I think working through different product iterations of, if we thought this was the right outcome, what would it really look like from a product perspective or a product portfolio in three to five years? And which of those seems right or rational or it will go the way I think the world goes. I think asking for other opinions. Sometimes I run surveys to the leadership team where I'm just like, what percentage of our revenue is going to come from small businesses versus big businesses in three years? And if we all agree on that topic, we should just take it as the truth and we should just fill it. If we disagree, then we should talk about it and we should talk about the strategic ramifications if we chose one path or the other path.

(00:47:35):
So for me, it was getting more comfortable having an opinion, honestly, about how the world was going to go, and also feeling comfortable that we would be able to change it when we learned that maybe that wasn't exactly right. We would have the machine, the execution machine behind it to try it out and then change and iterate and improve with customer feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):
At which point in your career was this overcoming this fear and uncertainty? Was it sometime within Facebook?

Ami Vora (00:48:07):
It was sometime within Facebook. It was really when I was stepping into the bigger ads jobs, getting to be Head of Product for Facebook ads. I got feedback, I got a lot of feedback over the course of my career and some of the stacking of feedback was basically like, you could be the smartest person in the room, but it doesn't matter if people don't like you, which is very complicated feedback and I wouldn't give that feedback to anyone else, but I took it very seriously. It was coming from so many different places, it was coming from people I'm really trusted. And so I went out of my way to be more likable, which for me ended up being shrinking myself a little bit and not being so aggressive and not being so opinionated, being more unobjectionable.

(00:49:07):
And the weird part is that it worked for a long time. People were more likely to work with me, they were more likely to say nice things. I mean, I take this to extremes. I wore earth tones for two years because I was just like, I got to fade back a little bit. And then at some point I actually had to do a leadership job and my team was like, well, what do you think? What's your opinion? And I was like, you've been telling me not to have an opinion for so long. And so it took a little bit of work to get back to, oh yeah, I have a lot of opinions, I have a lot of thoughts. It is okay for me to express. It is needed, my team needs me to have these opinions and thoughts and be a leader who can take ownership and be visible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Thanks for sharing that. Do you think that was the right approach, going and indexing far to the other end and then realizing that maybe that's too far, or do you think you would've done things differently looking back?

Ami Vora (00:50:05):
Yeah, it's one of my Roman empires. I think about this every so often, way too much, I think. Especially because I talked to other senior women who received similar feedback and chose not to act on it or did act on it, and what happened to their paths were different. I think where I landed is I wouldn't give that feedback to someone else. And the way I do give that feedback, actually, because I think there is a lot of really useful information in that. The way I do give that feedback is, you do need to be able to work with a broader range of people and the way to do that is to expand your tool sets. You're not going to make yourself smaller, you're not going to be any less of who you are, but you are going to build new tools, new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors. And that is only going to make you bigger and more powerful and more expansive. But the end outcome is the same, is that you can work with more different styles of people, more different styles of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):
I love that framing. There's an episode that's going to come out before this episode with this professor from Stanford, Jeffrey Pfeffer, who teaches a class called The Path to Power, which is how to become powerful in the world. And he actually has a big lesson that many people hate hearing, which is, you don't need to be authentic in the workplace, what you're trying to achieve, you're trying to achieve stuff and you can do... You need to use tools that you need to use to achieve the thing you want to achieve. So sometimes don't be exactly who you are and act in a slightly different way, which is basically what you're describing.

Ami Vora (00:51:42):
More tools. I think that's a theme that's coming up, is just like, I'm all about more lenses, more keys, more tools in general because why not? Why not have access to more different styles of things?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:54):
Something that you were talking about subtly is the being a woman in tech and being a female leader. I imagine you've gone through some stuff that isn't what something men would've gone through. Is there anything there that you want to share or anything you've learned about just being really successful as a woman in tech?

Ami Vora (00:52:13):
I think we've talked through some of them. I think one, you get a different style of feedback and a lot of the ways to interpret that feedback. I think to this day, I get feedback that is about walking a very narrow tightrope where not only do you have to change a bunch of things and do a bunch of things that are important, you have to make people feel a certain way about how you do them and the ways that they want you to make you feel are diametrically opposite. Some people are going to be like, be more directive so that way everyone knows your thing. Some people are going to say be less directive so people can come to their own conclusions. Some people are going to say move faster because there's always more you can do. Some people are going to say move less fast because otherwise you're going to end up steamrolling people.

(00:52:57):
And a lot of it is personal, there's a bunch research about how women get a lot more personal feedback that is less about the content of their role and more about their style, I think that is still true and there's often a kernel of truth in it. For me, this is forever work. I do have biases toward execution and being directive and things like that, but I think learning how to interpret and respond to feedback has been a really important point for me and making my choices of, just because I'm getting feedback doesn't mean I immediately need to respond to all of it. There's a step in between where I can choose, is this feedback I want to take action on in this exact way? Am I going to look for more themes, take action in a different way, or am I going to say this is who I am and I understand the trade-offs, I'm going to do a better job of giving people context on the decisions I'm making and why I'm choosing these trade-offs. But actually this is part of how I want to operate and I'm going to keep on operating.

(00:54:01):
And then I think we just give women weird advice. Here's a hot take. I think we tell women things like, you need to find a mentor and you need to find a sponsor, and that's just another set of hoops that we have that we tell women to jump through that I don't think we tell other parts of the population to jump through. I think we tell women to unlock your future success, you've got to find somebody who has made all the same life decisions you have and who you look up to and relate to, but who also had an hour every month to be an oracle to tell you all the things you do in your life. And it feels like yet another burden where you're like, I don't know how to do that.

(00:54:45):
I had the extreme generosity of so many wonderful leaders who helped me on my way, but I didn't feel like I had this mentor and for a while it was just like, oh man, if I only had a mentor, I would know how to do all of this stuff and it felt like another weight that I needed to carry, which I didn't. I had everything I needed, people were so kind and generous, but I didn't recognize it that way because we talk about it differently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):
Thank you for sharing all that. I wasn't planning on going in this direction, but this is such important advice for say, young women that are just getting started in the same product. Is there any advice you'd want to share to help them get to be the next Ami?

Ami Vora (00:55:23):
Oh, I mean number one, no next Ami, they're going to be their next themselves. That is maybe the most important thing, is everyone will only tell you their own story. That's all anyone can do, but the thing that I tell people is, don't dampen who you are and your strengths, just continue expanding. Whenever you run into a problem, just add more to the things that you can do, the tools that you have, the way you can express yourself. Just keep on adding and growing and don't shrink yourself, ever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):
I love that. I want to move to a different topic. There's a few things I definitely wanted to touch on while we had our time together. One is that I hear, now this is going to be a total tangent, but I think it's really important and I'm excited to talk about it. I hear you're really good at setting goals and aligning incentives really well for teams. One of your colleagues told me you're best in class at building product orgs and figuring out how product orgs can best work with other teams. I'm curious if there's any tricks or lessons you can share here about what you've learned about how to do this well.

Ami Vora (00:56:27):
Yeah, I mean I think one thing is to try to decouple all the things we're trying to do. Sometimes when you give people direction, you're like, okay, everybody just go get revenue or everybody just go get GMV. And it seems obvious because that's the thing you have to do as a company, but there's only a few places where you are guaranteed to get that and it's measurable and you can do it. And that leads to what I call toddler soccer, where everybody just runs to the same surface or the same customer set or the same exact product where you can do this and it's measurable and you end up, everyone's tripping on each other, everyone's trying, nobody really gets contact on the ball, there's no coordination. I have three kids, I've watched a lot of toddlers play soccer. [inaudible 00:57:18], it's a very fresh, very fresh metaphor.

(00:57:20):
And instead, one of the things I like to do is just detangle, okay, as a company, let's think about our customers. Let's think about all the things they're going to need in their journey. Let's think about how we will know how we will match our own metrics to customer success. Let's play the entire field. What would it look like if we could detangle it so that every team we had internally had a different goal that ladders into a goal framework that's actually the thing that we need to do to solve the full customer impact? And then you don't have the same swim lanes problem. You have plenty of room for people to make progress on their lanes. They all know how they fit into the bigger picture, and it just opens up a lot more growth for every team and it makes sure that we're solving the customer problem end to end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):
Is there an example that you could share to make this even more concrete from say, WhatsApp or Facebook or Instagram or anything like that, where you can share some of these goals that you've like, oh, this worked out really well? I know it's probably private information and partly-

Ami Vora (00:58:25):
It might be trickier. I mean, maybe going back to the GMV example. Maybe instead of motivating everyone on GMV, you motivate them on GMV per surface and you divide up the surfaces, or maybe you motivate them on actually different goals that underlie. When you think about GMV, what are all the various engagements, customer engagements that lead to GMV? Can you goal on those input metrics, can you goal on number of people who visit, number of people who convert, number of people who reorder, number, etc? Rather than going strictly on the output.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):
So the core advice here is each team should have different goals that are part of this metrics tree that ladder up to revenue, GMV, something like that?

Ami Vora (00:59:07):
Whatever, yeah. The thing that best matches the overall customer outcome that mirrors the company outcome as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
Got it. And there's always this balance between it's actually the best metric versus it's something they can move and understand and it's easy to watch and it's movable and things like that, right?

Ami Vora (00:59:24):
Yeah, and you have to have faith that it is actually connected to that output metric. You don't want to create a metric that's disconnected just to make a team feel good. It really does need to solve the customer problem and that's reflected in company's performance, but you can usually break it down into smaller pieces and I think that breaking down into smaller pieces and assigning those out to teams, that's really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
Is there anything else along these lines of things you've learned about helping teams work together and not play toddler soccer, beyond having different goals that all ladder up to the one that really matters?

Ami Vora (00:59:58):
I think there's value in also acknowledging that teams are going to have different incentives. Even inside a team like cross-functional teams on the same pod or whatever, are going to have different incentives, they're going to come in with different information, they're going to have disagreements. And certainly, different teams inside a company or different pillars inside a company, different products inside, they're all going to have different incentives, and I think sometimes that feels like something is going wrong when people disagree, but actually, that's just a sign of healthy tension and knowledge.

(01:00:34):
I think the thing that makes tension healthy is one, when you can acknowledge it and say, yeah, of course there's tension. You're bringing different information than I'm bringing. We should be disagreeing. No one's a bad person, no one is coming in with poor intent. Everyone's doing the thing they are supposed to do and that is a useful thing to do. And then you have to agree on an outcome that you're aiming for. If you disagree on what the company outcome is or what the customer outcome is, then you've got some structural stuff you need to work out and normally you just have to escalate it, but if you agree on like, we're all trying to move this metric by changing this customer experience, then all you're doing is having a conversation about the best way to do that using the different information that everyone is bringing. And I think that's super important to just have as a rational, open, explicit discussion, as opposed to trying to hide it or pocket vetoing or something else. Because you assume that when someone disagrees with you that, I don't know, there's something emotional or wrong about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):
But it's fascinating.

Ami Vora (01:01:40):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):
There's a piece of advice I once heard from the Head of Product at Airbnb once where we were trying to find, reorg the business and try to figure out the best org and his advice and something he realized is, there's never the best org, there's just the best idea we have at the time with the here's the things we know are not going to be optimal about it and let's build processes around that.

Ami Vora (01:01:59):
I think that's my take on leadership in general. Especially as you get more senior, you can only make bad decisions. At some point someone can bring you a problem, you can recognize a problem and you can solve it, and there's so much happiness in solving that and tying a bow around it. But as you get senior, the only problems you'll see are ones that are fundamentally unsolvable because otherwise, someone would've solved it before they got to you. And so all you're doing is choosing which branch of suboptimal you're going to put your name on and describing the principles you're using and the context and the fact that it's suboptimal, but it's still the best thing. I think that's a really hard thing, is just to recognize and acknowledge that increasingly people only see you do, make suboptimal decisions and from a distance they're just like, why is that person only making bad decisions? And it's because those are your only options. All you can do is choose the least bad, the best possible for the time, for the problem that's consistent that makes sense with the framework, and that's been a tough thing to learn too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):
You said somewhere that as you get more senior, you get worse at everything because the problems get harder.

Ami Vora (01:03:14):
Yes, exactly. I mean, it's a kind of dark view of leadership where yeah, you can't fully solve problems, you have to say no a lot people are unhappy with you. I thought as you get more senior, everyone listens to you and they like you and you could just say a thing and then it happens and that is not at all accurate. It really is, most of the decisions you make are not going to be perfect.

(01:03:42):
And I think I'm all about just normalizing and acknowledging those hard truths because otherwise, I feel like I'm failing. And if I just know that something is normal that it's part of the job, then it's not me. It's just like, okay, this is a fact of the job that I have to get accustomed to if I want to have this kind of impact. And there's something about having the impact, being able to serve the customer, being able to be part of this team, there's something about it that is so worthwhile that it's worth being terrible at everything and being visibly terrible at everything because that is the best way that I have to have that kind of impact in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:21):
I think this is really important for early ICPMs to hear because they see their CPO and founders making all these decisions and they're like, what the hell? That's a terrible idea, why are they doing this? What you're saying is just like it's the best... Options are limited and then-

Ami Vora (01:04:38):
[inaudible 01:04:38].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:38):
... nothing's going to be optimal.

Ami Vora (01:04:39):
Yeah, no org is optimal. It's definitely not. You can optimize for the people you have and you can optimize for the products you have, can optimize for the customers you have and you can optimize for the technology you have. Those are the options that you have, and in every one of those you trade off everything else. And so you just have to know, there's not going to be a perfect where all of it works and that's okay. That is part of the fun of it. That's part of getting to do this work, is continuing to improve, but it's hard. It's hard when people, it's hard, especially when you want everyone to think you're so great at everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):
This idea you mentioned of as a senior person solving people's problems, feeling really good, reminds me. Rolling to this, there's this Harvard Business Review article from the '70s or '80s or something about monkeys on your back. Have you read this or heard of this?

Ami Vora (01:05:24):
Oh yeah, yeah, I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:26):
Where it's basically like as a manager, [inaudible 01:05:28]-

Ami Vora (01:05:28):
You're trying to get monkey off of your back on people's backs?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:28):
Exactly.

Ami Vora (01:05:28):
Right, right, right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:32):
People come to you, Ami, here's my monkey, please take it for me and feed it for me and take care of it. And your job as a leader is to keep the monkeys on people's backs and help them figure out how to feed this monkey themself.

Ami Vora (01:05:43):
It's a weird one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):
To get it off their back. It's very visceral. I want to talk about Faire and your current role as a final section of our chat. First of all, what was it like starting something completely new after 15 years at Meta at the various properties of Meta?

Ami Vora (01:06:00):
Yeah, I mean, I was so lucky. I had such an amazing run at Meta. I got to work with amazing leaders, truly great products. And I came to Faire for the same reason that I've been anywhere, because I believe in the people and I believe in the mission. A lot of my family in India is in wholesale and local retail, which is what Faire does, and so it was also a very personal thing for me too. I felt like I knew those customers. I'm a huge fan of small businesses, I got to work with a bunch of them in previous jobs as well.

(01:06:30):
I would say coming to Faire, I mean, one of the things I always think about is that especially as you are more senior, ramping on anywhere feels terrible because you expect to be as good at your new job as you were when you left your last job, but you forget that at your last job, you were there for years, you had years to build up the vocabulary and the cultural context and the network and the product knowledge, and then you're stepping in somewhere where you know none of that, but you have the same expectations of yourself of being able to have an impact and improve things and help your team. And so I always just try to remind myself, it's going to take time and what's most important is not for me to try to come in and change everything immediately, but to learn enough to be able to change things like 60 or 90 or 120 days in the future. And so that breathing helps a little bit.

(01:07:29):
It was also really interesting because Faire was entirely new to me. It was a new business model, it was a whole new set of people. It was a whole new set of customer problems. And so every interaction I just had to learn so much. I had to learn, who is this person? How do they see the world? What's the problem they're talking to me about? What's the customer impact, I think? So it was just a dramatic learning curve, which I always really love.

(01:07:54):
Maybe the last thing I'd say is, again, I was super lucky at Meta. I think I always had this maybe deep-seated insecurity that maybe I was only good at Meta. Maybe there was something about that network of people and how great they were and how well I knew those products, and maybe I wouldn't be that successful somewhere without that scaffolding. And so leaving and being able to go somewhere else and lead through change and a new place, a new customer set, a new business model, that's also been really, really affirming for me, honestly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:34):
Well, you have a lot of fans at Faire from the people I know there.

Ami Vora (01:08:36):
[inaudible 01:08:36].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):
And so clearly, things are going well, at least as far as I can tell. Something that I think is, Faire definitely has, and a lot of companies have, is a very product minded visionary founder. And CPOs classically last a year or two, and then they're like, ah, this sucks. The founder just tells me what to do and what's the point of this role? And it's so frustrating. I'm curious just what you've learned about, at least so far, about working with someone like that as a CPO and not just being this middle person between what the founder wants to do with the team, this building.

Ami Vora (01:09:09):
Yeah, I mean, this is going to sound so naive, but I literally didn't know how important it was for me to have such a great relationship with the CEO, because I always had great relation, I was lucky, I had great relationships with a lot of people at my previous jobs. I was like, oh, of course it's going to be fine, everyone's going to let me do what I want, whatever. And I think I just got really lucky because Max is an amazing CEO, who's also super growth mindset and super open to talking over ideas, even when they involve a lot of change.

(01:09:42):
So when I was onboarding, one of the things I always like to do is write a list of observations. I go out and talk to, I have one-on-ones with a lot of people, and I write, here's the themes that I'm hearing. Here's what's going well, here's what's not going well. And that's a way for me to both share what I'm seeing and build some credibility and trust that way, but also for people to give me feedback and be like, oh, you're wrong about this, just so I can correct my starting point of knowledge.

(01:10:10):
And with Max, I also wrote a parallel document of hot takes. So once a quarter or so for the first year, I'd write a document that was just like, hey, for sake of provocation, if we wanted to fundamentally change a few things, here's ideas on what we could fundamentally change. And Max, very, very well could have just been like, hey, can you please just run product? That's you're job, can you please do that? And instead, he and the entire rest of the executive team were like, yeah, let's step through these. Let's talk about which of these we should try, let's talk about maybe context you don't have for why these don't make sense or why we don't do these. And that was such a gift because I was able to build such a great relationship, a trusting and complimentary relationship with Max and the rest of the exec team, and also that he took seriously things that he really didn't have to that I have so much respect for that, and I think I got really lucky in just finding a great CEO and exec team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):
Is there anything you learned about this vetting process? Say you're a founder looking for a head of product, A CPO, any advice for how they might vet this person to make sure they are good fit and will last?

Ami Vora (01:11:32):
What I'd say to everyone else is, make sure you just have a mind meld with a CEO. Before you decide to take the job, spend a day together, understand how they think and how they operate, and whether you're going to work together in a way that feels really high fidelity and high trust and you're going to have room. I mean, I'm not a founder by any stretch and so when founders ask me what should I look for in a head of product or CPO, I say something a little bit different, which is, make sure that you really need the level of seniority that you are hiring. I think that a lot of founders think, I need a CPO, I need a VP of product, I need someone who's really senior, when often the founder has a bunch of the vision and knowledge, and what they really need is somebody to build the product. They don't need somebody who's going to scale the team or build systems like they've got enough of that. And so that to me is part of building that complimentary relationship where the founder and CEO know what they need and on the CPO side, they know that they can mind meld enough with the CEO to actually have an impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:41):
Last question. You started as an intern in the PR department, I think, at Meta?

Ami Vora (01:12:47):
Oh, I started as a temp, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):
At temp, okay, amazing. And then you ended up leading Facebook ads and then WhatsApp and many other things. Can you share that story of just how you joined and how that happened?

Ami Vora (01:12:59):
Well, I had quit my last job. I knew that what I wanted to do was be involved in all the wild stuff happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 2000s. So I'd quit my last job, I was traveling around the world a little bit. I was living in New York, an extremely blissful lifestyle. I was unemployed, I was doing whatever I wanted. It was some of the best time I've had in my life, and eventually I needed a job, like you do. But it was 2007 and the only place I wanted to work was Facebook. You could hear the way people talked about these products. People would say Facebook is more important than than my car. It's like how I connect with the world. It was such a magical product, and you could hear that.

(01:13:51):
And I knew some people at the company and I convinced one of them to introduce me to everyone at the office. I'd made a trade, I said, I'll buy you a fancy coffee at Coupa Cafe in downtown Palo Alto, and in exchange just introduced me to everyone, everyone you know, take me around the office. So everyone I met, I said, "Hey, I'm Ami, I really want to work here. I'll do whatever you need." And the only call I got back was from the Head of PR, Brandy Barker, who said, "Look, we can't hire you. We didn't interview you. We don't have headcount. You're not really qualified." It was just like 10 reasons. I was like, okay, thank you for calling me. And she said, "But we need a temp to review our press releases, so if you want to come join a temp agency, we'll tell them to send you here." And that's what I did, I moved out to California and I slept on people's couches and eventually they hired me full time and I didn't look back.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:50):
And now you're on Lenny's podcast, what a run. It's interesting, this reminds me of another path to power rule from the Jeffrey PFeffer podcast, of networking is one of the best ways to acquire power in the world. So it's interesting that now that seed has planted in my head. Anyway, just A plug for that other episode also.

(01:15:06):
Ami, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Ami Vora (01:15:13):
Sometimes people ask me who are working in product, what's the one thing they should do to be successful at product? And maybe the thing I would say is, especially as an org scale or a company scales, there's just a lot of distractions that get between you and the customer. And so the one thing that I would just advise everyone to do is just think about the customer, talk to the customer, be an advocate for them. It's such a shortcut to everything else you need to do in order to be successful, but it's so easy for that to get lost when you're thinking about, okay, how do I get alignment on my team? How do I figure out my roadmap? How do I convince people to join the company? There's all these different things, but fundamentally, we're here to create value for the customer. And the closer you can get to that, I always found myself the happiest because I'm building that feedback loop with the customer, but also more successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):
Well, let me actually follow up on this because this is really important and interesting. There's a PM part of my brain of like, okay, but we also got to move some metrics and sometimes that metric isn't going to be moved by, we need to do something specifically for the customer, but it's something that will help the business. Is there anything there of just that balance of like, we need to move over this conversion metric, versus, let's focus fully on what does the customer want and need? Any thoughts there?

Ami Vora (01:16:34):
Yeah, I think we often make things adversarial that are not actually adversarial. It is very rare for customer value to be different than a company value on a long enough time horizon. There might be short-term divergences, but really, to solve, to create value for the customer, you got to be around as a business, otherwise you are creating zero value for the customer. And so I think really, just starting with the, what are the end goals and where does stuff diverge in the very short term versus the medium term versus in the long term? It shouldn't, and really thinking about where you are in the journey and how to place that. That always helps me because our metrics should absolutely be about long-term customer impact. It's very rare if those aren't, and then you're still able to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:26):
It comes back to our chat about metrics and how to do those well.

(01:17:29):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Ami Vora (01:17:32):
Cool, I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:34):
Here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Ami Vora (01:17:39):
The Year of Yes, by Shonda Rhimes. I almost never read nonfiction. I love Shonda Rhimes, made an exception for this one. It's about just saying yes to things and finding your voice when you do feel like you're sometimes the first or the only or the different, and what that feels like. And it was very life-changing for me, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:00):
That's an awesome pick. No one has recommended that one yet. Reminds me of an episode of Matthew Dicks, who has a Ted Talk about saying yes to everything.

Ami Vora (01:18:00):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:07):
He just says, Chris, to say yes to everything and his life is incredibly interesting as a result. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Ami Vora (01:18:17):
I watch a lot of witty workplace comedies from the mid 2000s. So I watch a lot of The Office or 30 Rock reruns. Things are just very comfortable that I already know everything, there's no surprises. I'm not great with new stuff right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:33):
I heard they're bringing back The Office. There's a reboot happening.

Ami Vora (01:18:36):
Oh really? Let's see.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):
Yeah, exactly. Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love, either digital, physical, anything?

Ami Vora (01:18:47):
Maybe a physical product that I really like. I drink a lot of coffee and tea through the day and it's just, I don't know, a calming ritual. And so I have a Fellow's electric kettle, that was my big work from home upgrade. So I have this life for kettle, I have a pour over kit. I have these lovely colorful mugs that I like, that has actually just made my day-to-day a lot better, is just a little feeling of luxury.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):
I love that. I think we have that same kettle. I also drink tea during every episode I have here.

Ami Vora (01:19:19):
Oh, yeah. You know it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):
So we're on the same page. Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family, in work or in life?

Ami Vora (01:19:30):
It is definitely not a motto. I feel like I know people have mottos and I'm so impressed. I'm like, you know what you are, you know what you need. I am not that person, but I have a piece of advice that someone gave me very early in my career. Actually, it was Chamath, he said, "You can either have more energy or less ambition." And I was like, oh, that's a little harsh, but also really true. And I think about that, it's another of my Roman empires. I think about it all the time where I'm like, okay, if I want to have this kind of impact, I'm going to have to do the work, I'm going to have to try new things, I'm going to have to feel uncomfortable, and sometimes I don't want to do those things. I don't want to do all of that work, and then I can't be mad if I'm not having the impact. Those two just have to go together. I also have to get lucky in all these different ways, but the two have to go together and that's been just a good governor, a little bit, of how I think about what I'm putting in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
I love that quote. By the way, if people don't know what you're talking about when you talk about the Roman Empires, there's a meme on TikTok where somebody said that every man thinks about the Roman Empire at least once a week. Right?

Ami Vora (01:20:39):
It's made me think about, what are all the things I think about repeatedly without really having trigger or reason? And there's still a lot. I don't think about the Roman Empire though. That is not one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):
I also don't think about the Roman Empires, something's wrong with me. Okay, final question. You can blame your colleague Barr for this question. He tells me that you are very good at jokes, you tell very good jokes. Do you have a joke that you want to share by any chance?

Ami Vora (01:21:06):
I love jokes. There was a year at Facebook where I posted a joke of the week to the company and they're all terrible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:15):
To the company.

Ami Vora (01:21:19):
Yeah, exactly. All right. Here's my favorite joke.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:22):
Great.

Ami Vora (01:21:24):
Why don't sharks eat clowns?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:26):
Why?

Ami Vora (01:21:27):
Because they taste funny. I'll tell you one more and you can choose one, you can choose which one. All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
No, we're not cutting anything.

Ami Vora (01:21:36):
What did the zero say to the eight?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:38):
What did the zero say to the eight? Something like us. Okay, no, I don't know.

Ami Vora (01:21:43):
Nice belt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):
Nice what?

Ami Vora (01:21:45):
Belt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:46):
Belt. Oh, I got it.

Ami Vora (01:21:51):
[inaudible 01:21:51].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):
I get it, I get it. I'm going to tell you a joke. I just heard a standup share. How do you turn an egg into a vegetable?

Ami Vora (01:22:02):
I feel like if you put a letter on it'll turn into a vegetable name, but I can't think of the letter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):
I love that you're really trying to analyze it and get there because I don't know if it's ever possible to actually get the answer. Okay, so how do you turn an egg into a vegetable? Squash.

Ami Vora (01:22:17):
That is definitely my level of joke, definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
They're like, this is for your kid. Go home and do this joke.

(01:22:24):
Ami, this was everything I hoped it would be. I'm going to read again the goal you had for this podcast, I 100% think we achieved it. To be as authentic as possible and show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I think exactly what this podcast ended up being. Thank you so much for being here.

(01:22:40):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Ami Vora (01:22:46):
Oh, thank you, Lenny. It's been such a pleasure. I write a blog on Substack at amiboard@substack.com. It's called The Hard Parts of Growth, it's just about how even when you're working in great places with great people at great companies, sometimes things are hard and that's normal. And so you can find me there. I do the same, I crosspost to LinkedIn so you can find me there. And how can people be helpful to me? I don't know, just by being great, by being kind and nice and making the world slightly better. Yeah, I think that's what we can all do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):
I love that, and I will link to your Substack in the show notes, so if where people want to check it out, and I'll recommend it. I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to recommend it for my Substack.

Ami Vora (01:23:25):
Thank you, Lenny, so much. This was such a fun conversation. I've really enjoyed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:29):
I loved it. Ami, thank you so much for being here. Bye, everyone.

# I’ve run 75+ businesses. Here’s why you’re probably chasing the wrong idea. | Andrew Wilkinson

## Transcript

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:00):
You don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, "I'm going to make the next great AI company," I think that is the equivalent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than maybe anyone else in the world. What is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:20):
Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote.

Speaker 3 (00:00:24):
Fish where the fish are.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:26):
The biggest mistakes I've made have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:34):
It's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:38):
It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7. So many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively. I think the fundamental question is, do all jobs just become a single prompt?

Today, my guest is Andrew Wilkinson. Andrew is the co-founder and CEO of Tiny, a holding company that's often called the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet. They own over 40 businesses ranging from Dribble to WeCommerce to the AeroPress coffee maker, and they focused on buying profitable businesses from founders and holding them for the long term. Andrew and his co-founder bootstrapped the business from zero to hundreds of millions of dollars in value, and Andrew personally was worth over $1 billion at one point. In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover a bunch of strategies for coming up with a good business idea, what common business ideas you should avoid, his experience automating much of his work and life using AI, and what that means for employment in the near future. Also, what he's learned about happiness and money and how they're not directly related, and also how getting diagnosed with ADHD and then taking SSRIs was the thing that most impacted his happiness in life.

(00:01:46):

(00:04:12):
Andrew, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:04:15):
Oh, thanks man, great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):
I've been wanting to chat with you for so long. There's so much that I want to talk about and I want to start with a topic that I know that you think a lot about and that it's also in the minds of a lot of people, which is coming up with a great startup idea and this is something that a lot of people are thinking about right now because AI makes it so easy to actually build your idea into something real, and I feel like this is something you spent a lot of time thinking about. I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than, I don't know, maybe anyone else in the world. I feel like you're in the top a hundred, top 10, something like that. I don't know. Does that feel right?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:04:51):
I've definitely had a lot of experiences and I've probably started or been involved with 75 different projects or businesses where I've been a primary contributor and I wouldn't say that's anything to brag about because I've been an inch deep in a mile wide. So that's been in a lot of ways kind of my Achilles heel is I get too excited about ideas and I start too many businesses, but as a result I've seen almost every business model under the sun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:18):
Amazing. Okay. Yeah, I think the benefit is for us is we get to learn from your experience. Let me just ask you this question, what is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:05:28):
Ultimately the best thing is something you're going to be interested in, but I think a mistake a lot of people make is they choose something that everybody is interested in. So for example, they say I don't know anyone that has hadn't had the thought, man, I would love to start a really cool restaurant or I want to have a cool cafe or something. And in reality, what they think about is how cool would it be to come up with an amazing logo or all fun stuff, design the menu and stuff. But in reality, operating those businesses is miserable and it's also a very hard business because every morning millions of people wake up and they go, I should start a cafe. But on the flip side, almost nobody wakes up every morning and says, "You know what? I'd love to start a funeral home," or "I would like to start a pest control business," or "I should start software that helps people fill out forms for the government."

(00:06:26):
And Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote. He says, "Fish where the fish are." And he gives this example, he says, "If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen and they're all elbowing each other out of the way. They're all using the best lures, the best fishing line, they all have amazing strategy. You actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition. And I think that's probably the most important thing in business is actually to find those niches where you can actually make real money because competition equals lower margin. The more competitors there are, the lower your prices have to be and the more competitive the business is ultimately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:19):
It doesn't feel intuitive to go after small markets and to find niches. So let's just follow that thread. Well, why is that actually a source of some of the best ideas starting really small and niche?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:07:30):
I don't necessarily think it has to be something that is small forever, but it has to be something that like I think about if you're a first time entrepreneur or a student or something, you don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, "I'm going to make the next great AI company," or "I'm going to launch a new bank," or something like that, something that is very, very rigorous and complicated and highly competitive and regulated, I think that is the equivalent. I think you really want to take the baby weights and start slowly building your muscle. And I think about my own experience starting a business, I was so lucky because the first business I ever started my web design agency, which became Metalab, that was so easy and it worked immediately because all I had to do was know how to build websites and be able to talk to potential customers.

(00:08:33):
And then once they said, "Yes, I will pay you $5,000," I just had to send them an invoice, do the work, and that was it. It was a very simple business. And because of that, I got immediate positive feedback and I built my own narrative. And my narrative was, "I'm good at business, I can do this, keep going." And then I went off and I started taking my money that I made from that original business and that's when I fucked up. So I went out and I started a pizzeria and I lost all my money. I started a designer cat furniture business, a online DJ school, a skin cream business, all of these things. I've just lost all my money almost immediately, but because I had that first win I kept on going. And I just think it's so critical that people choose a business where they get that initial win.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:22):
Okay, this is a great topic. This is just like how do you avoid creating a job for yourself that you hate? There's a lot of business opportunities and ideas that like, "Yeah, you can make this work," and then it works, and then you're stuck doing this thing running a restaurant. My wife tells a story where a friend started a coffee shop and then he's like, "I thought I was starting a coffee shop, but I'm just replacing milk and buying milk all day. That's my job now." So just kind of along those lines to help people avoid creating a beast that they didn't expect any advice for Just how to know this is maybe even though this may work and make money, you probably don't want to be spending your life doing this sort of business.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:09:59):
So I just started a pressure washing business. I was speaking at a local business school and after I spoke, one of the kids walked up to me and he said, "Hey, I'm an entrepreneur. I've started two or three businesses in the past doing landscaping and I'm not enjoying school." And so just on the spot, I said to him, "Why don't you drop out and we'll start a business together?" And I'd been cooking on this idea of a pressure washing business because I'd studied that industry a little bit and I knew a few friends who'd done it in other cities. And I had this unfair advantage, which is I owned a whole bunch of media properties where I could advertise it for free basically. And so we started this business and I think for him, he kind of had this moment of, do I really want to be washing people's driveways for the rest of my life?

(00:10:47):
And what I said to him is, "Look, if this gets to scale, you'll never touch a pressure washer unless you want to." If the business can get big enough where you can have employees, he can just focus on sales or digital marketing or whatever aspect of the business that he really loves. And I think that's the biggest thing that a lot of entrepreneurs miss. They say, "I don't want to do that for the rest of my life. I don't want to be in the back of a dry cleaner dry cleaning clothes." And to me it's just a question of scale. I think the cafe is a great example because a cafe, if it doesn't get to a reasonable scale is just a job.

(00:11:26):
There's a big difference between a business and a job. I think if you could start a pressure washing business where you're the only employee, yeah, that's a job, but if you can get to a scale where you can drive 10 leads a day, then you don't have to do any of the pressure washing and you just do what you love. So I think a lot of people have this kind of Protestant work ethic where they think, well, I've got to be the person to do everything. And I think they really need to lean into what I call lazy leadership, which is how do I get away from the things I hate as quickly as humanly possible? How do I be Teflon for tasks?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
It's interesting that this business is non-software related at all, this pressure washing business. So I guess just for folks that are coming up with ideas, and I imagine most ideas are there's a pull to make it software oriented, something AI is going to help build for you and help you run. What's your calculus on just going down a direction of real world physical business, like a restaurant power washing business versus a software just like what are the benefits of that direction when should someone actually seriously think about doing a business like a power washing business?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:12:30):
I think if someone's listening to this podcast, odds are they're someone who's kind of a digital native. And I think the question is, what's your unfair advantage and what are you great at? So for me, I think I have reasonably good taste. And so what I could do is I identify and I knew enough to identify great design and development talent, but mostly I was lucky because I was a talker. I was good at meeting with clients and selling myself. And so ultimately my highest and best use my superpower was sales. And so that can be applied to anything, anything where you need to go out and you need to sell a customer. And so really it just comes down to what do you get drawn to and then how do you find the profitable business within that? So here's an example. A friend of mine, he owns a restaurant and he said, "Oh, I love it. I'm so passionate about it. It's this stunning beautiful restaurant in my hometown."

(00:13:32):
And he said, "But it's really just a job for a few different people and we can't make any money at it, but I've been noticing that there's all these vendors that service the restaurant and those guys are making a killing." And so he told me about a business that cleans grease traps, another one that cleans exhaust vents for kitchens. So I think looking around and seeing where your passion is and then sniffing around within it, probably somewhere within your passion, there's an opportunity. So for example, I love movies. My happy place is a dark theater. That's the best way for me to de-stress is go to a dark theater and watch a movie and get lost in it. And probably about four or five years ago, I was like, "Man, how cool would it be to invest in movies in some way to be a part of that creative world?"

(00:14:26):
And so I started looking into funding movies and I realized that when you fund movies, like 90% of the time you lose all your money. And even if you do make some money, you rarely make a good return. But I spend a bunch of time understanding the industry and learning about it. And then two years ago I was in New Zealand and I met the founder of Letterboxd and I realized, "Oh my God, this is a business where this has a moat, so it has a network effect, it's a huge social network for film reviewers. It's something I'm passionate about and it's something that we can buy at a fair price." All those things came together and I was like, "Oh my god, I can invest in film now." In the same way I used to be a barista, we ended up buying the AeroPress coffee maker company. So I follow my passions and spend a long time learning different industries and then I find the profitable niche within.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):
Okay, and this is a great takeaway essentially when you're thinking about startup ideas, make sure there's some connection to something unique to you where you have some unfair advantage. This makes me think about Brian Armstrong. I saw him do a talk once and he gave this really amazing insight about why Coinbase did well and why he started Coinbase. And it's because if you look at his background, he had this really rare Venn diagram of background of computer science and I think it was cryptography and economics, which is the exact set of skills you need to start something like Coinbase. So I think the tip there is just what is that unique Venn diagram of skills in your background and just ideally what you're building connects to that and gives you an unfair advantage.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:16:02):
Well, yeah. I just met another UVic student at the local university student. She is interested in marketing and so she's gone out and she's found some local clients, so small restaurants and stuff and managed their social media and she said, "Yeah, it's okay. I can make a thousand bucks a month, but it's a lot of work," and the owners really want a lot for their money. And I said, "Well, if you just pivot that idea just ever so slightly, and instead of doing restaurants, you did realtors or wealth managers who have quite a large marketing budget and are used to spending serious money and it only has to work a little bit to make a lot of money for them. Those people, you can charge $5,000 a month."

(00:16:44):
So I think often it's you find your passion, your skill set, you zero in, and then you just kind of pivot and you find the most profitable way to do it. When I started my web design firm, I started mostly with local and small projects, but very quickly I found a job board in San Francisco where startups would share projects they needed help with. I could charge five times the amount for five times less work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:09):
This point about fish where the fish are I think is really important. You can start something that's awesome that you love, that you're so excited about, but nobody needs it. Talk a bit more about just what that looks like. What have you seen when you're thinking about ideas that tell you that there's fish but also not overfished as you pointed out?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:17:25):
I think it's hard like Warren Buffett has this great quote, "I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman." And I feel like in order to know what problems are valuable to solve, you kind of need to have valuable problems. So it's a bit of a hard thing because I remember when I was like 20, I would say, I hate how all the cat furniture I can buy for my cats is I bet people would pay a lot of money to solve this, but I didn't understand anything about the realities of that business model. I didn't understand how little people were actually willing to pay. I didn't have a enough life experience to go, "Yes, that's actually a worthwhile opportunity." And I think that being able to know what people would pay to solve the problem realistically is incredibly valuable.

(00:18:20):
So my example of a realtor selling a house, because I've studied that industry, I know that a realtor can make like 20 to $50,000 selling a single house. So I can intuit that they'd be willing to spend a lot of money if I have a unique way of getting them clients that'll buy houses that'll convert at a high conversion rate that is worth $5,000 a lead maybe, right? So I think you kind of have to understand the problem in depth before you really know. Because when I was starting out, I would go down every rabbit trail, every infomercial idea I had I would think was genius.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
Or people, I don't know, that don't have this experience, which is most people. Is there one thing you do, maybe a heuristic that gives you a sense, maybe there's something here, maybe there's a lot of fish, maybe it's a value of prompt or no, the soul tell me it probably isn't.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:19:12):
No, unfortunately, I think it's mostly gut. I mean Munger and Buffett talk about having a whole bunch of mental models in your brain and they form a latticework, right? And they all kind of piece together. And I feel like for me, there's so much of this that is, it's almost like I'm an AI model and I've trained on all this data of what works and what doesn't and what's a good moat and what's a bad business, et cetera. And when I see it, I just immediately know. I mean, I think all entrepreneurs are so lucky now to be able to go into Claude or ChatGPT and just say, "Hey, I'm thinking about starting a Botox clinic. Can you break down the numbers? Is this a good business? What's hard about it? What is the regulatory moat? What would my payroll look like?" I didn't have any of that and so I started so many incredibly stupid businesses, but I think there's no excuse at this point. You should be able to do it with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):
That's a really good tip actually. Then there's this point you made about boring is good. That's a really good piece of advice. A lot of people are going after flashy stuff, things they condemn on Twitter. Your advice here is boring is actually a really good thing because fewer people are going after it. Is that the general tip?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:20:22):
Totally. I mean, so I started this business, one of my first called Flow and Flow was basically Asana before Asana came out. So it was a way to manage your to-do's and projects with your team in a web app and we basically did the thing. We made the mistake that so many entrepreneurs make, which is to go after an industry that everybody goes after just like cafes. Everybody has the idea, man, I wish I could design my own project management system or my own to-do system. And not only that, but everybody loves new things. They love jumping around. I know me personally, in the last three years, I've probably used three different productivity systems and I love jumping around in them and I didn't understand that and I ended up losing $10 million trying to compete with venture-backed businesses and bootstrapping.

(00:21:17):
It was all my own money, poured $10 million, lit it on fire trying to compete with Asana because I didn't understand how the business world worked really as they had raised hundreds of millions of dollars and they were run by the co-founder of Facebook and it was a little bit like, I'm Fiji and I'm deciding I'm going to invade the United States in retrospect, just completely silly. Now on the flip side, if I'd taken that same amount of energy and I'd instead focused on, let's see, what's a really boring one I've heard about, there was a business I saw recently.

(00:21:52):
They were making $30 million a year and all they did was help people fill out forms to get government assistance in certain programs. So it'd be like your uncle is disabled and you need to access government funding. The process to do it is incredibly time-consuming and miserable and you have to fill out all these forms. They just have software that fills out the forms for you and it says, look, you're going to get $20,000 as a grant, pay us a thousand bucks, and that is such a boring, nobody wakes up and goes, "I want to make form filling software," but I think they would if they could make 20 million a year

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):
Along these lines of just bad ideas, things people shouldn't start, what are a few ideas that you think everyone thinks is going to be a great idea and then they do it and then they always fail?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:22:37):
Well, I think the biggest mistake, I can speak from my own experience, the biggest mistakes I've made business-wise have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better. So for example, me and one of my best friends about 10 years ago, we really wanted to start a bar. We just thought it'd be so cool to have a bar where us and all of our friends could go, we thought it'd be great for the city. We thought we can run this really high margin because we're tech guys, we know how to build systems, we're good at business, and we were utterly humbled. We realized that we didn't know anything about business compared to someone who runs a pizzeria. If you think about it, like my example earlier of if you run a software company, what has to happen?

(00:23:24):
You have to hire a bunch of nerds, they need internet connections and computers and you need to pay them and you need to coordinate online and everyone can work asynchronously. Nothing has to go right. It's not that complicated, at least at small-scale. A pizzeria, it's like if the baker doesn't wake up at three in the morning and start prepping dough, the entire thing is effed and all along the way there's a hundred different failure points from front of house, back of house, the deliveries, arriving on time, all this logistics. And so I think it's been stuff like that. I mean also I got into the news business, the local news business. I ended up buying an old paper in Vancouver and it's the exact same thing. It's like you can't take a brilliant management team and change a bad business model. Ultimately the business model wins.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):
This is really good advice. Basically if there's a bunch of dead bodies in that space, there's probably something there that keeps killing them that you're probably not aware of until maybe somebody figures something out, right? Once in a while, once in a blue moon, someone's like, "Okay, here's how we do this and then it works."

Andrew Wilkinson (00:24:34):
Well, look at Instacart. When Instacart came out, everyone said, "Well, Webvan failed. This is never going to work." And we still don't necessarily know if Instacart is a great business. I don't know, I haven't studied it, but I think it was like, okay, enough technology has changed that it can happen, but would it be easier to start Instacart, Amazon or Coupang or would it be easier to start an enterprise SaaS software company? Definitely the enterprise SaaS software company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
I see. So this is I guess is the advice there. The thing that is easy to start is the thing you should not do because everyone's going after that.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:25:10):
Well, it goes back to my gym analogy of if you're going to deadlift 300 pounds, trained for 15 years, you should have already had three startups and they should have worked and you've really built up the reps. And I think that if I was going to start Instacart, that's different than someone who's 20 starting it. Not that I would be good at it, but at least I would know what I'm getting into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):
Let's talk about something that is this endless debate on Twitter. Maybe it's a false dichotomy between lifestyle businesses, bootstrap businesses, this idea of not raising money, just making revenue, living off the revenue versus venture-backed venture scale companies feels like you're very good at the first bucket and a lot of people, this is their dream, "I'm just going to start something. I'll start a lifestyle business, make a few million a year, never raise money. Who needs VCs? VCs suck." Advice for deciding which route to go with an idea you have.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:26:03):
Well, I think it's just not true that a "lifestyle" or bootstrap business can't get huge. I mean, we bootstrapped the entire business and now across all of our companies we do almost $300 million in revenue. And the whole time I had been focusing on taking, starting small businesses, small ideas, simple ideas, often buying small companies and watching them grow really big. And I think that the only difference between what we do and what a venture capitalist does is the level of tolerance of burning money on fire. And I just haven't seen that If we choose the right businesses that aren't in incredibly competitive markets or where they have some sort of moat. So what I mean by that is a great brand or a network effect like a social network or something like that, I don't feel we're holding them back by not letting them light up a bunch of money on fire because these things naturally grow.

(00:27:12):
The numbers, I mean they're like balloons, they just go as long as we don't mess them up too much. So I think the decision ultimately comes down to how hairy do you want your big, hairy, audacious goal to be? And if your big, hairy, audacious goal is I'm going to start the next satellite business that creates some sort of crazy technological revolution. Yes, you're going to have to raise a venture capital unless you're already a billionaire or something like that. But if you're wanting to just tinker and solve a problem that you think is not going to be hyper-competitive, so for example, that form-filling thing or software that just does a narrow thing that doesn't require 20, 30, 40 million to be lit on fire before it can make money, then you can have a wonderful life and build a wonderful company that can scale into the hundreds of millions of dollars if you play your cards right without ever raising money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:09):
Per the story you shared with Flow where you're competing against a venture-funded company, if there is a venture-backed company in this space, is the advice you're not going to win competing with them most likely and try to do something else.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:28:22):
Well, look at Things. Do you know Things?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:25):
I have used Things

Andrew Wilkinson (00:28:26):
I do too. It's awesome. Things still exist and Things has existed for 20 years. It's run by I believe one or two or three people. It's not a big team, certainly under 10 people, it was, I believe, bootstrapped and it's just consistently delivered an exceptional product and built up a loyal following. They have their 10,000 true fans who use it, and that's enough for them, but they don't do a lot. They've been very intentional. They don't do any AI stuff, they don't have an API. They're not on Android. They're very focused and I think they have succeeded. But the question is, what would an MBA or a business professor say about their success? If the measure of success is did they maximize taking as much market share as possible and grow to be as big as possible, then the answer is no because Asana and other people have built multi-billion dollar companies.

(00:29:28):
If the goal is the founder has an incredible life, probably has three houses, flies all over the place, does whatever he wants, has recurring revenue and he gets to work with headphones on building beautiful piece of software that people love, then I think he's won. I am generally much more in the camp of the Things guy has won, not Dustin Moskovitz. Dustin Moskovitz is just playing a different game than the Things guy. And if Dustin Moskovitz was running Things, he'd be miserable and if the Things guy was running Asana, he would probably kill himself because he wants to put his headphones on and build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):
I wonder why nobody has come. It feels like just with lifestyle businesses, if it's working and you would think somebody would come in with more money and more funding and just eat their lunch, is the key that the market is too small for a VC to ever be excited and so that's why no one's coming for them?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:30:21):
I think so. I mean, I think Things probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know any of the numbers or whatever, but I would assume it makes between five and $25 million of revenue, which to a VC is not even worth considering a VC. For a VC to invest in your business, you need to have a story where it's worth 300 million to a billion dollars or more. So it's just not that exciting to them, which again, going back to fish where the fish are, you don't want to be fighting against the commercial fishermen. If you just want to have a little business where you get enough fish to feed your family and your village or whatever, find the other fishing hole. Don't go where the trawlers are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:04):
This is great advice if you're trying to start a non venture backed company is find. This metaphor just keeps working for us, which is fish where the fish are, but not where the professional fishermen are. Also, ideally not where there's just a ton of, I don't know, fishermen from all over the place. I don't know, solopreneur fishermen. Okay. Coming back to just starting a successful company, what would you say are the keys to an amazing business model, an amazing business broadly, what should you be thinking about and looking into? I know you spent a lot of time thinking about this. When you're buying companies, what are a few bullet points that you want to focus on?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:31:38):
What I do for a living is basically buy businesses. So in my early career I started one business, then I started about 10 more, and then I realized starting businesses was extremely hard and I was doing pretty well. I was making quite a bit of money and I'd sold one of my businesses and I was looking out at the next 10 years and really asking myself what do I want my career to be and am I happy doing what I'm doing? And the answer was no. I did not starting businesses and experiencing that failure rate, it was incredibly stressful. And so I picked up a book about investing and I got lucky. The first one I bought was about Warren Buffett, and for those that don't know, Warren Buffett is he's counter to every VC kind of hustle culture thing you might hear because he basically just sits quietly in a room and reads all day, despite owning 260 different businesses and being one of the 10 wealthiest people in the world, his life is incredibly calm.

(00:32:44):
He only does what he wants and he spends most of his time quietly reading and once or twice a year, he makes a big decision to buy a business. And so when I read about Warren Buffett, I just thought, wow, I'm a sucker. I'm running around like a crazy person trying to run all these businesses. Why am I not just buying businesses and letting them run? And so when I'm buying a business, what I'm really looking for is something that I can't mess up. Right now, obviously we buy a business, we try not to mess it up, and we're very intentional, actually very odd in that when Tiny buys a company, we generally just leave them alone. If they already have management in place, we say nothing changes, no one should know that we've even bought them. Obviously people know that, but really there should be no change whatsoever.

(00:33:31):
The only change that we generally make is if the founder wants to leave the business, then we'll bring in a CEO to run the company, and that's probably the most important decision that we make. So I'm looking for a business though where it is so good that it's hard to mess up, and most businesses are very easy to mess up. One person leaves and the whole business falls apart because it's held together with dental floss and duct tape. And so I'm really looking for what Warren Buffett would call a moat. So a moat is basically a brand, so that could be a brand like Coca-Cola, Tylenol, Advil, something like that. So something that gives you pricing power where you can consistently charge and you have loyal customers or where we usually find a lot of opportunity is in network effects.

(00:34:23):
So typically we're looking for a community that's gotten so big where people don't want to go elsewhere. So for example, we own Letterboxd, which is the largest social network for film lovers. And the question is, if someone else wants to compete with us, why would someone go to their social network that has a small number of users when all their friends are already on Letterboxd? And so you see that same kind of thing with Instagram or Facebook or similar. And so we're looking for businesses like that, something that has staying power that is hard to compete with and that we can hold over the very long term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):
It was interesting when Elon bought X, how that was such a test of the power of network effects. If you think about it, back then he changed the name. So the brand completely changed the team. 80% of the people left. What was left, it was the network and the network effect and the simplest way. Just for folks that aren't super familiar with network effects, the way I think about it is just network effect is where every additional user that joins the network becomes more useful for everybody.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:35:27):
There's another moat, which is high switching costs, which I don't really like because it's not really very consumer friendly, but an example might be Salesforce where no one wants to, they've spent years and they've done all the implementation and trained everyone on it, and it's kind of the standard, everybody hates it, but ripping it out and switching is such a pain in the that they just won't bother. That's another form of sometimes a great business, but again, that's more depressing. I don't love that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:56):
What's the last company you guys bought?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:35:58):
We bought Serato. Serato is the largest DJ software company in the world. So if you ever see a DJ playing and they've got a laptop in front of them, probably using Serato to DJ.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
Wow, that is super cool. What I'd like a funding to be walking into.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:36:14):
I used to DJ so I was aware of them and it was one of those moments we talked about earlier where I understood the business. They had a really interesting mode of this huge passionate user base and deep hardware integration. And I also love DJing and I was able to analyze the business and luck comes to the prepared mind and it worked out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):
This is another great callback to your excellent piece of advice of just ideally what you're working on, whether you're starting the company or buying the company, is you have a unique unfair advantage or some kind of unique background that connects to that idea. Let me ask you one more question before we shift a whole different topic, hint, hint, AI. Something that I know you talk a lot about, something you believe strongly and something you deal with a lot is when you buy companies is just as people and the challenges of management and hiring and people. So what have you learned about just how to successfully, I don't know, find amazing people, keep amazing people, help people be more successful within the companies that you operate?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:37:15):
My business partner, Chris, has a really great quote. He says, "There are no problems. There is only people problems." And so we've found that you could tell us that there's a disaster that one of our business units is about to fail or something like that. As long as I'm surrounded by really great smart people, I feel fine. But when we have a bad actor, we have a psycho or a narcissist or a really horrible, difficult person we're dealing with, all bets are off and life becomes incredibly stressful. So I'd say I spend probably 20% of my time just trying to make sure we're filtering people very carefully and ensuring we're working with people that we enjoy. And I could talk about it in the AI, I've done some really interesting stuff to help me screen and identify difficult people, but I've just found that the biggest mistake I made in my early career was I would hire people because I liked them on gut and I would think that I could change them.

(00:38:12):
So it's kind of like in romantic relationships, it never works out well. If you get married to someone and you go, "Okay, well this is going to be a great relationship as long as I can convert them to Christianity or I can change their parents or their personality," or whatever it is. And so I've just found that I've never been able to change someone. You can never mentor someone out into being a good employee. And the kind of heuristic I have is if I ever think, should I fire this person even once, I should fire them immediately. It has always been a signal, at least for me, that when someone's a superstar, I can't imagine firing them. I think it's impossible, I'd be lost without them.

(00:38:56):
But when I repeatedly start going, "Man, is this person going to work out?" Almost always within six to 12 months, it doesn't work out. And so I really try and be really direct about stuff like that and just cut when it's not working. So I'd say the lesson really is hire for what you need. Don't hire just for potential, which is counter to what a lot of people say. A lot of people say hire for potential and coach them into being whatever you need. I just haven't found that. I think you need to hire someone who already is fully formed and can do what you need. But again, everyone does it differently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
This is big advice. Powerful advice. Is this true not just for the CEOs of the companies you run? As for folks under lower down the ladder too?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:39:39):
Well, for CEOs, one of the most interesting things we've observed is, so I'll give you an example. We had a CEO come in and we were interviewing them and in my opinion, the business needed to grow via organic marketing. In his opinion, it was enterprise sales. And so when we're interviewing him, he keeps going back to his experience building with enterprise sales. And there's this great saying, "To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail." And so for him, he's looking at this business and going enterprise sales, that's the way to grow. I hire him, but I say, "Look, if we're going to hire you, we need you to do the organic marketing." Lo and behold, of course, he goes off and he does the enterprise sales thing. And I've just found that hiring CEOs is like they're an elephant and you're the rider.

(00:40:31):
They're going to go wherever it is that they want to go. And so listening incredibly carefully to people's words and their experiences, because generally people will do the thing they tell you. So what I look for when I interview a CEO now, I want to be nodding along. I want to go, that's exactly what I would do or that's way smarter than my idea. And then I just leave them alone because I've found that anytime I try and pull them in a certain direction or coach them or whatever, it just doesn't work. And again, this could be my problem. I might be the world's worst coach and mentor, but for me, that's been what's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):
I imagine there's also an element of they won't love the job if they want to be doing say enterprise sales, and then they're creating viral TikTok videos all day and tweeting. They're like, "What the hell?"

Andrew Wilkinson (00:41:15):
Well, I've also found people will shoot themselves in the foot. If I tell them an idea in a board meeting and I say, "I really need you to try this," it never works because usually they sandbag it, right? They don't really put their heart into it or they're just placating me and they don't want it to work. They want their idea to work. And so I've learned not to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:37):

(00:42:41):
Let's talk about AI. It's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed, AIphile. I don't know what the term is, and I love that you're not just the kind of person that just talks about it and tweets pontifications, you're clearly using it in every facet of your job and looking for more ways to use AI. So I have a lot of questions here because I think this is where more and more founders are going to be where you are today. First of all, just what's in your AI stack these days? What are the tools you find yourself coming back to most or finding most useful?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:43:10):
So the primary tool I use is a tool called Lindy, Lindy.ai. And what it basically lets you do is build workflows and agents. So it's very simple. You might say, "When I get an email in the Gmail API, I want to add an AI agent that reads the email and labels it based on that." Or you can build a crazy Rube Goldberg machine that sends different emails all sorts of different places. So for example, when I get an email and it's related to my kid's school, one of the big problems I have is that my kid's school sends so many emails, the field trip is on Thursday and you need to bring the following things. And meanwhile, there's parent teacher interviews and all these things get added to my calendar. The AI agent automatically takes that, puts it onto my calendar, makes sure there's notes for all the things I need to prepare and stuff. So I have just basically tried to take every single thing a human could do in my inbox and automate it with Lindy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):
And you're sitting there in Lindy doing this yourself or do you have people that you've trained to help build these sorts of things for you?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:16):
No, I do it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):
Okay. How many agents, if that's the term you want to use, do you have running for you roughly?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:22):
Oh man, I think I probably have not a crazy amount within... Let's see. Well, each workflow probably has four or five agents. So for example, my inbox has four or five agents, and then I have a whole bunch of other, I've got a calendar agent, I've got a meeting agent, I've got an email agent, I've got a scheduler, I've got a CRM, and basically they're all different workflows. So the whole bunch of agents within.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Okay, and you're not an investor in Lindy, right? You're just a fan, super user.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:53):
No, no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):
Fun fact. I actually am. So this is great.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:56):
Oh, no way. That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:57):
Tiny angel investor. So just want to put that out there, which I love that this came up organically. What are a couple other really interesting use cases, workflows you've built that people might be inspired by it?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:45:08):
Let me go through the email one a little more. So basically emails come in and the first agent says, does Andrew even need to see this? Let's say you're in a thread and you've already chimed in and everyone's just saying, cool, that works. I don't need to see that. So just archives that never. So that immediately reduces my email by about 20%. Then it decides is this something that is time sensitive? Is this something that needs to be dealt with in the next 24 hours? And if so, it labels it in a special 24-hour label. So when I go in my email, one of the biggest stresses I find is I go, "Shit, there's 200 emails in here, and if I don't go through all of them, I don't know if there's an emergency burning somewhere." So now I do. Then it takes any email or every single email and it decides, is this a simple decision?

(00:46:00):
So for example, let's say you email me and you say, "Hey, do you want to get lunch?" So it emails me privately and it says, "Hey, Lenny wants to get lunch. Do you want to say yes? Do you want to say yes, but in a few months? Do you want to say no? How do you want to say no?" And it gives me multiple choice. I just can say four, number four, and then it'll email you as me and it'll write out a nice thoughtful email or whatever. So stuff like that is so freaking cool and helpful. And I'd say that it's replaced stuff that my full-time, I used to have a full-time assistant just working on email that's all completely automated and there's all sorts of other cool stuff I'm doing there. Other agents, I'm working on one right now to manage my calendar, which is really complex. I do a lot of scheduling and a lot of rules. I have another really simple one. It adds emojis to every single calendar event. So when I look at my calendar, I've got beautiful little emojis for every single calendar event. Very silly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:00):
What are the emojis? Do they represent something?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:03):
Yeah, so if I write weightlifting, it'll just do a guy weightlifting or whatever. I've got one that, this one's cool. Basically what it does, every time I email someone, it looks them up online, it figures out what city they live in. It checks my CRM and air table. It says, "Okay, I don't know where do you live."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:21):
In Marin, in the Bay Area.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:22):
Okay. So it'd say, "Okay, you email Lenny, he lives in Marin." It puts in the database you live in Marin. And then next time I travel to the Bay Area, the agent will see two weeks before and it'll say, "I saw you're going to San Francisco. Here's all the people in San Francisco you should try and have coffee with." Right? So just all these things that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):
I would pay for that.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:43):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. All these things that I've dreamed of having my assistant do that my assistant could just never consistently do because she gets distracted, we're doing an event, there's something going on. It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:02):
Okay, I want to follow that thread, but first of all, what other tools do you have? Lindy's one, what else do you find really useful?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:48:08):
So the other one is Replit. So Replit is basically a vibe coding platform. You can literally go into it and say, "I want to make a website for my sound software business. Here's a big document with a bunch of details," and it'll go and design a pretty impressive website. But then you can also build web apps now. So you can literally be like, "Yeah, build a Python web app that does XYZ," and the design is getting so good because it uses Claude 4. You can start saying, "Do it in the style of Stripe. Think this through, rewrite all the copy and the tone of David Ogilvy or Malcolm Gladwell," or whoever you like, and it does a really incredible job. So what I'm finding is that things that previously would've frustrated me because I would've had to rely on a team of five, I can just do entirely on my own when it comes to web projects and stuff like that. So I'm having a blast with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):
That's cool. So your team Replit versus Lovable, Bolt, v0, is that roughly right?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:49:12):
I mean, they're all great. I, just am the most familiar with Replit, and it seems like it has the most functionality. It has a lot of beef to it, whereas Lovable and Bolt seem a little more basic. You might have to deal with deployment and stuff in a fiddlier way with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):
Awesome. Okay. Anything else?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:49:32):
Another one I love, so Limitless. I don't know if you've seen this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):
I've got one of those.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:49:37):
It's really cool. So clips to your shirt. I actually just put it on my pocket so no one actually notices that I've got it on usually, and I just have it on all day. And what it does is it just records everything I do. And then I can say, the other day I had a coffee with someone and I'm the kind of person where I go a mile a minute and I say, "Oh, I'll send you that and I'll do this," or whatever. And so at the end of the day, I can just say, "Hey, what did I promise to people today?" Or even better, everyone loves this use case, I have a fight with my girlfriend. And she says, "You didn't say that." And I'm able to say, "Well, actually you did." And you can query it as an LLM.

(00:50:16):
So you can say you're a couples counselor. Look at this fight. What did each person need? How did it start? What are the key lines? Where did it change? How could you do this better? And so honestly, from a relationship standpoint is probably where it's been the most useful. What's cool too is that has an API. And so eventually, I haven't gotten there yet, but eventually you'll be able to just have it record your entire day and then automatically go into your Todoist or whatever it is, and add to-do's or send emails or whatever you need it to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:48):
Wow, this is so fun. Or just per your point with the relationship, ask it, "What could I have done better today? Where did the day go downhill?"

Andrew Wilkinson (00:50:57):
Yeah, I saw a guy on Twitter. He said, "Every day I ask it, 'How could I have been a better dad?'" And it'll be like, "Oh, your daughter tried to get your attention about this. You should have paid attention," or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):
And that was with the Limitless data. Oh, man, I love that. With the relationship, you didn't go where I thought you were going to go, where it's like, "Oh, but who actually said it? What did you actually say?" I love that It became much more wholesome of just like how could we have communicated better holistically? Okay. My wife actually is like, "Don't wear this around."

Andrew Wilkinson (00:51:25):
You just got to wear it really covertly. Honestly, I know it sounds kind of cheesy because you think like, "Oh, it'll tell her," right? But in reality, usually you're both guilty in the fight. And my girlfriend has actually appreciated it because there's been half the time it'll be like, "Oh yeah, Zoe said this and it triggered this," but a lot of the time it's me too. And I think I'm totally right. So I find it actually really helpful. Other tools, I mean otherwise, it's the basic stack of Claude and ChatGPT and Gemini. And Gemini I use mostly for things that are really large. So for example, all my medical records, I have trained on Gemini 2.5 just because the other ones can't really go through it all. Claude, I use for writing very extensively. I find it's the best for that.

(00:52:14):
And then ChatGPT for everything else. In terms of cool things I do, recently, I went through my entire medicine cabinet and I just took big photos that showed all the different medicines and stuff. And now I can say something like, "Hey, I'm really tired and stressed out today. What supplement should I take and what dose?" Or I'll say, "Remember all the medications I'm taking, whenever I ask you a health question, always remind me in the context of I might be taking that medication." So a few times it's said, "Hey, you shouldn't take this other medication because your genetics say you're not compatible with it and you're already taking this other one." So stuff like that's been really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:57):
For that use case, do you come back to a specific conversation where you've given it that context, use a project or something-

Andrew Wilkinson (00:53:02):
No, I say remember. I just say remember these supplements, this is what I have in my medicine cabinet or this is what I take every day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:10):
I see. So just tap into the memory of ChatGPT.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:53:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:13):
This is awesome. This makes me remember that. And this connects to other points you've been making, I've started to use ChatGPT deep research to prep for these conversations. I used to have a researcher who did this for 400 bucks. They did research on every guest that I had, four to 500 bucks, and gave me a whole doc, "Here's everything about them. Here's their background, here's questions you might want to ask." Deep research is better. Just as of recently, especially with o3-pro.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:53:39):
We were talking earlier about agents. I forgot one of my favorite agents. So it looks on my calendar 30 minutes before I meet anyone. It goes on to Perplexity and it does a deep dive on the person and it sends me, it goes into my email and it gets the context of the meeting. So often I book meetings three months out. So I usually look at my calendar and I go, "Who is this person? I don't even remember booking this meeting." It'll text me before and it'll say, "Here's who you are, here's your background, here's the email context of why we're meeting." And it basically does all the research for me. So I do the same thing. I also use deep research and say, "If I'm meeting them, you know everything about me. What are our commonalities and what are all the fun things we should talk about?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:22):
Oh my God, I just want to plug and play all these agents you've built to use them myself. Interestingly, I tried to create an agent to do this research kickoff for me, but I don't think you can automate ChatGPT deep research. Okay.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:54:35):
Only Perplexity. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:37):
Okay. Perplexity is great too, but it's different. Okay. So let me follow this thread I was going down, which is around job displacement. I know you think a lot about this. So with me, this researcher as a contractor I was working with for a few months, I no longer need them. Your assistant, you no longer need. Thoughts on just the impact we're going to see on jobs as a result of AI.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:54:58):
There's this great William Gibson quote, "The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed." And I think that we are in the Palm Treo phase. Do you remember the Palm Treo?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):
No.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:55:10):
So when I was, let's see, in 2007 I think, was that when the iPhone came out? 2007?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:17):
I know [inaudible 00:55:19].

Andrew Wilkinson (00:55:18):
Something like that. In 2007, there was this device called the Palm Treo and it was like a little PDA with a stylus and it had a little modem attachment. And so what you could do is you could get your email anywhere and that was this shocking thing. It had a black and white or barely color screen and you could go in and email people. And I remember walking through the mall buying shoes while answering business emails and going, "This is the ultimate freedom. This is incredible." But the problem with that device was it sucked. You had to use a stylus, it's not a good user experience. And then the iPhone comes out and you're like, "Okay, this is what I was waiting for. This is the real thing." But I got a little preview with the Palm Treo and so right now people like me who have the time and skillset to nerd out and build the agents can do this. It's just not accessible to everybody.

(00:56:14):
And I think that if it was accessible to everybody in terms of if you could just open ChatGPT and say, "Hey, ChatGPT, I run a business, can you help me?" And it started asking you questions and it said, "Oh well you do sales. Do you want me to set up a sales agent? Okay, great, plug in your HubSpot API, now tell me a few things and then give me access to all your data." And then before you know it, it's just a digital employee that's on the other end of the phone on ChatGPT just like in the movie, Her, that you can talk to and it can go do stuff. I think that is kind of the iPhone moment that we're going to have in some time in the next five years. And so I think that if AI doesn't progress, we will see some serious job displacement, like what you already mentioned, the translators, the researchers, the admin, some assistant jobs, depending on the kind of work they do, those jobs will definitely be massively affected.

(00:57:13):
But I think pretty quick, all knowledge work jobs could be affected if the models scale in the way that they say they're going to. I mean if you trust Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, I mean Dario Amodei said by, "2027, our models will be smarter than all PhDs." So in any subject. That is a staggering statement. And he's been a very conservative kind of almost fearful voice in the AI world. Very cautious to say things like that. And so when he said that, I perked up and started listening carefully. I don't know that that's how it's going to play out. He might be trying to fundraise, we have to take it with a grain of salt. But if that's true, then I think so many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):
Okay, there's a lot here. I actually had Mike on the podcast, their CPL, Mike Krieger, and he pointed out that Dario, every prediction he's had so far has been right over the past few years. And so there's a reason to listen to his insights. Okay. Andrew, I know you're not going to have all the answers for people. But let me ask you kind of a two-part question for new grads and for people currently in the workforce say like, I don't know, senior product manager advice on what they should do, where should they focus? What skills will matter most? What jobs do you think will last? What advice can you give us?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:58:43):
Everybody 10 years ago, do you remember there was this whole movement that we should teach kids how to code? Remember that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):
Mh-hmm.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:58:51):
Now teaching kids how to code is teaching kids Basic and we have a GUI, right? You don't need to learn punch cards and basic programming or MS-DOS because we all have keyboards and mice. We don't have to do that. And I feel like coding has really gone away because of that. And I think now people are saying people need to learn how to prompt, which I think is very true for the tool set right now. But I don't know how relevant that is in the future because I think we're still, again, in the Palm Treo phase, I think that the AIs will be very good at eliciting what the actual problem you're trying to solve is and reinterpreting it in a way that it can optimize the query to get the right answer and solve the problem.

(00:59:38):
And so I think the fundamental question is do all jobs just become a single prompt? For example, does a CEO just grow the business while making the customers happy and turning a profit or something like that? And it is able to actually be an omniscient presence that can run a whole company. Now that's a big I'm someone building AI agents. I can barely get it to reliably do calendar entries and that kind of stuff. So I don't think that's totally imminent, but I can certainly see a world where that's coming. And so the question is, what is one to do when that reality is barreling down at you? For people who have resources, I think there's a lot of things they can do in terms of investment, they can invest in the companies that'll benefit from this, companies that have a lot of compute or energy or that sort of thing.

(01:00:29):
So that's one thing, but that's not really the question. The question is what do you do if you're a smart 18-year-old or 19-year-old or whatever? In my opinion, I think the best thing to do right now is to get incredibly good with these tools and utilize them to build enough wealth that you can put the money into diversifying into compute and energy. And I do think that while everybody thinks that all jobs will go away in five years and robots will be everywhere, people generally overestimate things in the short term and underestimate them in the long term. So I think there's going to be this long window where robotics is not anywhere near good enough to even do raking leaves and stuff. And I think there's going to be a ton of opportunity for people to just spin up new businesses that never existed before.

(01:01:20):
I was talking to some friends and we were like, "What do you do in a world of abundance where everything is really cheap and companies operate almost autonomously?" I think there's a lot of weird skillsets that we can't imagine right now. For example, just being funny, right? Being funny to hang out with them. Think about OnlyFans, right? Right now, there's this whole idea of OnlyFans where people are paying for comfort and connection, but in a romantic sense. Imagine people did that day to day, they just love hanging out with funny people. So you have a funny guy who you chat with or comes over to your house or whatever it is, I'm making stuff up. Maybe it's a guy who comes to play pickleball with you or something, I don't know. But I can imagine that in this weird world, there's all these weird new jobs.

(01:02:06):
So I think my take is things will either be totally fine or they will be terrible and we'll all be dead. And I can't predict which those is there. I don't think it's worth thinking about all of us being dead. And so I think it's really just lean into what are the tools, how do you stay cutting edge? How do you build businesses and wealth in this new world? But I am certainly feeling a little bit like all of our brains could be defunct in the next 10 years. And that's kind of a scary thought.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
I'm picturing this dystopian world where humans are just going around making jokes.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:02:44):
Where does status come from in a world of abundance? Where does status come from? Maybe it is just like being the best at hiking or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:52):
Well, let me ask you this because this is where it gets even more real is just with your kids. What are you encouraging them to learn? What are you encouraging them to get good at? Because this is the real problem a lot of people are having right now is what will matter in the future. Obviously we don't know, but what are you encouraging them to focus on?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:03:09):
Well, I don't know. I mean there's so little, they're five and eight. And so really what I'm focused on is making sure they're socialized and they're polite, very basic. So are they comfortable talking to adults? I often send my son, whenever he wants something at a cafe, I always make him go up, ask nicely, pay himself, all that kind of stuff. But at this point I feel like for the first 10 years of life, you're just trying to make sure that they're not traumatized or rude. And I think it's going to be really interesting when they're 10 plus where they're really aware of this stuff and can start building with these tools. And to be honest, I just don't know. I think I just want them to lean into whatever they're passionate about and go from there. But I have no idea. And to be honest, it's not something I'm worrying about because it's too hard to worry about. I don't know, it's too multivariate. There's too many ways it can go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:03):
I feel like a core part of your message is just get good with these tools. There's this classic quote, "AI won't replace you, it'll be somebody very good using AI is going to replace you," at least for a while. And so it feels like a big part of this is just use these things. Before we started recording, we were having a mic issue and I love you just went straight to ChatGPT, "ChatGPT, how do I connect this mic to reverse side and make it work?" And I feel like that's just a habit to build is just like go to ChatGPT whenever you have a problem like that. I've been doing that a lot. I was connecting a subwoofer from what wire do I need to buy to connect the subwoofer to the receiver?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:04:37):
Well, the best part about ChatGPT is I used to just get stuck and I have ADHD. So when I got stuck, let's say, what's an example? I was redoing my home IT security. And what will happen is I'll be in the terminal and I'll enter something and then something goes wrong and it just keeps erroring. And then I'm like, "Well, I'm out." I have ADHD, I can't tolerate this. I just lose the thread completely. And ChatGPT allows me to stay on track and go so much further and faster than I ever could before. I love not being artificially stopped in your tracks and being able to continue the flow state as a result.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
And also I noticed you were using voice mode, which is what I've been using more and more. And I feel like that's something a lot of people sleep on is just the voice mode where you could talk to it and not have to sit there and type your questions. Okay, so let me go in a different direction. You've been spending a lot of time, you wrote a whole book about this, of just your journey from, you call it Barista to Billionaire where you started serving coffee, then you ended up being very successful, then realize that didn't make you happy. You're quite unhappy with lots and lots of money. I think a lot of people hear these stories, they see this stuff, they're like, "Yeah, okay, I sort of get it." But they still do the same sorts of things. They still assume they will be happy once they reach that next goal, that next title, make certain dollar amount. What can you share? What have you learned about just what it actually takes to be happy that you think people are still not really recognizing and still kind of are confused about?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:06:10):
Do you remember when you're in your early 20s? I remember when I was in my early 20s, I'd always be like, "I need to move away to Europe. I need to go discover myself." And I'd be really anxious and stressed out and in an existential crisis and then I'd fly to Europe to go backpacking or something and I'd still feel anxious and have my existential crisis. It's just now I'm in Europe. And I think the reality is that whatever's in your brain, whatever that anxiety loop is, doesn't go away just because you have a bigger house or more money in the bank account or you're in Bali or wherever it is, that's a chemical reaction happening inside you that relates to your past and your DNA and all that stuff that creates that soup. And for me, I've always been a very anxious person. I've always worried about tomorrow, I rarely enjoy today, I'm always worrying about what could go wrong in health or my businesses or with my family or whatever it is.

(01:07:12):
And so when I started my business, all I thought was I just don't want to work for someone else. If I can just wake up in the morning, do my own thing, make 60K a year, then I'll be happy. So I got that and then it was once I make a million dollars a year and I can buy a house, well, I got that and so on and so on and so on all the way up to at one point being worth over a billion dollars, by the way, should redo the title of the book from Barista to Billionaire, now it's former billionaire because our stock went down, but it didn't change anything. I'm still just as anxious as ever. I remember a month ago, I had this day where I was sitting in the sauna and I was stressing about a bunch of business problems and money things and I stopped myself and I was like, "Wait a minute."

(01:08:04):
10 years ago I had all the same thoughts and I was stressed out about similar kinds of problems and our revenue was $20 million bucks or $15 million bucks. Now we're at almost 300 million and I'm still stressed about the same things. And the saddest part was as I met more and more wealthier people all the way up to multibillionaires, I realized they were all still comparing themselves to their peers, competing over who has what and tracking stuff and still unhappy that anxiety loop or depression was still in their brain. I remember I had this moment where I met this guy who is a single-digit multibillionaire, and he goes, "Oh, Jeff Bezos, he's just so fucking rich." And I was like, "Wait, what do you mean you're worth $5 billion? What can he do that you can't?" And he goes, "He can buy a super yacht." And it's like, "What?"

(01:09:09):
You can look at that guy and you can say, "Oh, that's a wacko and all the other stuff." But the reality is that we're all just comparing ourselves to our peers, whatever our peers have that we don't feel hard done by. And I remember just thinking like, "Oh my God, how do I avoid becoming this?" And that's the scary reality is no matter how lucky you are, I mean we're also fortunate. For me, I live in Canada. I have every opportunity that I ever could have hoped for. And there's people all over the world who have nowhere near what I had growing up. And yet I felt hard done by because in my neighborhood I was the poor kid. I wasn't poor globally. I wasn't even poor based on Canada. But all my friends had big screen TVs and would go to Hawaii and I never got to do any of that stuff. My parents were stressed about money. So I feel hard done by.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:05):
There's a phrase of friend's financial advisor once shared, "The Joneses are doing really well," and that's hard to get over. So what changes did you make to just be happier? It's hard to give up money. It's hard to give up more money you could make. It's hard to give up things that money buys, I guess just so what did you change?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:10:28):
Well, there's a few things. I mean, one was reframing money to some degree to have it be something that wasn't just about feathering my own nest and making it better. So for example, I was talking to a friend who's very wealthy and I was saying all the feelings I described of have all this and yet I don't feel better. And he said, "Well, what are you working for?" And I said, "Well, I guess I'm just working for the numbers to get bigger and have more employees and that's nice. Our businesses do good things in the world and help more people and stuff, but ultimately it's just to pile up cash." And he said, "I've reframed it so that all my money, 90% of my money plus, goes into my philanthropic foundation and then it gets given away to great causes. So when I think about working really hard or losing a deal or an investment going well, the win isn't for me. The win is about doing something good."

(01:11:26):
So I did that and that definitely helped. I also stopped spending as much money. I found that the more stuff I had, the more houses I had, the more people that directly worked for me to manage all that stuff, the less happy, I was owned by my stuff. And then I work really hard not to have people... I try not to beat people over the head with it. I drive a normal car. I don't bring people to my house until I know them really, really well. I meet them on neutral ground, I meet them in a cafe. I dress like a schmo. I just try not to be a weird out of touch rich person. But the biggest thing, which is a weird answer, is actually medicating myself. So basically all my life I've been really anxious.

(01:12:18):
And in 2020, I remember I was watching a movie with my ex-wife and I was looping on, "I need to respond to this email. If I don't respond to that email, this person's going to be mad." And then I realized that I was watching a movie for the last 20 minutes and I didn't know anything about what was happening in the movie. And then I was going, "Oh my God, my wife is going to be mad at me. We're going to get in a fight," and I'm projecting all this negative stuff. And in that moment I was like, "Okay, maybe I do need to try an SSRI or something. This is not sustainable." And so I went to my doctor and I got prescribed with one, and I remember I was so scared of it that I cut it into 10 pieces. I said, "I'm just going to take a tiny little piece."

(01:13:01):
And it took me six months after that to try any. But I started taking these pieces every day and I just noticed that within about three or four days, it was like someone had turned down the volume on the nasty voice inside of me doing all that. And for the first time in my life I felt relief. No amount of money or success or attention or anything else had done what this little tiny yellow pill could do for my mental state. And so now I've been on an SSRI for four and a half years or something like that. And then I also started medicating my ADHD. And I would say that my brain went from Times Square to a quiet library. And I think a lot of people are scared of that, but ultimately most people are acting out something that's going on inside of them. There's a trauma or something medically going on and that's creating this anxiety, this depression, this feeling and addressing that is so much more important than trying to get praise from the external world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):
Wow, it's really powerful. I really am really thankful you're sharing this. The advice most people hear, the general, I don't know, culture is just like, "No, don't take meds. Don't medicate yourself, I don't know, there's all these downsides, all this risk. The pharma industry is trying to make money." I love this other perspective of it. It's actually really effective and actually makes a big difference in your life and it may be the only solution.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:14:29):
Well, it's funny because if you have a headache, I don't think many people say, "Oh, don't take Tylenol, you're benefiting Johnson & Johnson, big pharma." They go, "Yeah, you take a Tylenol when you have a headache." Or a lot of people have seasonal allergies and they take antihistamines and they forget that histamine is not just in your nose, histamines in your brain and everywhere in your body. And so when you take an antihistamine or even a Tylenol, you're changing your brain, you're changing the way you think, you're changing everything. And yet for some reason, people are so scared, myself included, of taking an SSRI or similar medication to treat something that is ruining their life. Anxiety was ruining my life. Every minute of every day I was convinced that something terrible was about to happen. And even now medicated, I still have that voice. It's not like that frankly beneficial voice that helps you grow your business or whatever becomes unproductive at a certain point. And I think that it is wonderful to be able to actually just get a little bit of solace from it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Well, for folks that, I mentioned many folks listening, are like, "Oh man, I should really explore this," what's the best way to explore is to talk to your primary care physician?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:15:47):
Yeah. I think talking to your doctor, and one note I think a lot of people miss is when I was so scared of side effects because you hear about all these horrific side effects of people lose their libido and feel terrible and stuff. And so I looked into it and a lot of the side effects are due to the way that people metabolize different drugs. And so you can actually do your 23andMe or similar DNA test and you can find out how you metabolize different SSRIs. And then I chose one that I could metabolize well. And so I've had no side effects or problems. And I know every time I mention this, I get a lot of people that say exactly what you say, big pharma and all this other stuff. But I just ask everyone listening, if you take a Tylenol or you take an antihistamine or other medications, I don't know why something that can be so profoundly helpful is something that people need to be afraid of.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):
Amazing. Andrew, we've covered so much ground. I love the spectrum of topics we've gone after. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything you wanted to double down on? Any last nugget you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:16:56):
One thing that was shocking for me was I was doing... My doctor asked me to get a cognitive test, not because I had any problem, but he said, "Look, it's really important to get a baseline in your 30s because then as you age, we can make sure that you're not getting Alzheimer's or dementia or whatever." So I go and I do this test with a neurologist and she asked me a bunch of questions. It's, "Remember these 10 digits and say them backwards and all this stuff." And finally when I get my test results back, she said, "Look, your crystallized intelligence, your ability to remember stuff, long range is totally fine. You're above average. Your short-term memory, your working memory is 10th percentile, very, very bad. And you probably should get checked for ADHD."

(01:17:47):
And I was like, "Nope. There's no way. I don't have ADHD. I'm organized. I've got to-do lists. I built a business. I wasn't the hyper kid in school or anything like that." And she said, "Well, look, just humor me. Just go get tested." And so I went through this crazy process. You can go online and just quickly get tested or whatever. But I went through this really, really five-day process to get tested. And it turned out that I do have it. And it's really interesting because if you take the normal population of about 5% of people have ADHD, but about 30% of entrepreneurs have ADHD. And many entrepreneurs I talk to, they love new things. They love jumping around between a million different topics. They're an inch deep and a mile wide like I described. And they describe themselves as unemployable. And frankly, I remember I was so skeptical of ADHD that when my girlfriend told me, a friend of hers got diagnosed with it, I sarcastically said, "Oh good, she better take some meth," talking about stimulant drugs.

(01:18:54):
Previously I was very, very skeptical of ADHD, but it is a real brain disorder if you actually dig into it. It's a very real thing, very objective that people have poor executive function. And for me, it's given me a lot more empathy for myself and my behaviors because at work, if you have ADHD, you can delegate to other people and build systems to get around your disability. But at home, that's where it really plays out. And so for me, it's like my girlfriend asked me to take the garbage out, and I say, "Of course." And then I forget three times in a row. And she views that as you are being very hurtful and you're not caring for me. And it causes all sorts of different problems at home.

(01:19:37):
And so for me, not only did it make my work life better because I was more focused, but it actually really helped me in my personal life and it made me feel not broken. I always felt a bit broken. I couldn't put my finger on why, but I just went, "I'm not good at doing all the things everyone else seems to be able to do no problem." And so I think especially because you have an entrepreneur audience, I think a lot of entrepreneurs should consider getting checked for ADHD. Just go and ChatGPT say, "Ask me a of questions and tell me if you think I might have it." But I was very surprised, and that's been really impactful for me too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:13):
Man, this garbage story is very descriptive of my life, and so I'm going to do this. There's this implication that it's good to know this, right? It feels scary to feel like, "Oh, shit I might get diagnosed with ADHD." Your advice I imagine is it's better to know because you could do stuff about it.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:20:33):
Totally. I think it's like any medical thing, right? It's like there's an Alzheimer's gene, right? And if you know you have it, there's a lot you can do to slow the disease or prevent maybe getting it or whatever. It's always better to know. Even if you don't medicate, I think there's a lot of lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, and just things you can do to make your life easier, even if it's just explaining to your partner, "Hey, I need things to be explained to me this way so that I can be effective in loving you."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:05):
Beautiful. Okay. Well, Andrew, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:21:11):
Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:12):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:21:17):
If I could only recommend two, I would recommend The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene. It's basically like a compendium of every single type of personality disorder or psychological effect. How do people work their minds to make bad decisions? What is a narcissist? What is a psychopath? All that kind of stuff. And Robert Greene does such a great job of telling all that in a really engaging way by using storytelling. So every single chapter has a story about someone with that personality disorder. So I love that book.

(01:21:48):
The other one that I love is a book by Felix Dennis called How to Get Rich. It's hilarious because the whole book starts out saying, "I got rich and I regret it, and I wish that I'd become a poet." And instead he went off and he built this huge publishing empire, became a poet in his sixties, and then he died of throat cancer. So it's his story, he basically says, "I'll tell you how to build the business even though you probably shouldn't." And I read that when I was in my 20s, and I found it so exciting and inspiring, and then I recently reread it and I was like, "Oh my God, why didn't I listen to this guy?" Everything he said came true.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:23):
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:22:27):
I love Challengers. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's amazingly acted, amazing cinematography. It's like this amazing romantic triad tennis movie. Really, really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love? You already mentioned Limitless. Is there anything else?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:22:45):
I'm one of those people who really believes in the idea of a robot vacuum. I've probably spent $10,000 on different robot vacuums over the years, probably five or six of them. And I finally got one that actually works. It's called the Matic Vacuum, M-A-T-I-C. And basically, I think it's like former Google Engineers basically built like a mini Waymo car. So it has machine vision and it will avoid absolutely everything and never get tangled, and it can mop your floors and vacuum. I've been super impressed with it so far.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):
I've got one of these myself. Completely agree. My wife loves it, which I did not expect. She's like, "Turn that Matic on." It's very delightful. It has his little personality and it just does a really good job. And I'm not an investor, and that's awesome. I'm a huge fan. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:23:38):
Yeah. My favorite is a quote by Jerzy Gregorek. It's, "Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life." And I often find that anytime that I'm making the easy choice, my life gets hard. And when I make the hard choice to shut down the business, fire the person, say bye to a project that I was excited about, it's almost always the right choice and it makes my life a lot easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:07):
Final question. Okay, so let me know if this is true. I found that when you were a teenager, when you're running Macteens, you interviewed Steve Jobs at a conference. Is that true?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:24:18):
So when I was a teenager, I had a tech news website and I emailed the Apple PR people and I said, "Hey, could I interview Steve Jobs?" And they kind of laughed at me. They're like, "Yeah, there's no way. You're not going to interview Steve Jobs, but hey, why don't you go to this tour of the Apple Store?" So this is no other Apple Store has existed. This is in New York at Macworld back in 2004, no, 2003, something like that. And so I was really excited about that. So I show up to go do this tour and there's 30 other journalists there, and I'm first in line, and this big black SUV pulls up and this man gets out and the man is wearing gray New Balance, little circular John Lennon glasses, the mock turtleneck. And my brain finally puts it together and I realize it's Steve Jobs.

(01:25:11):
And he walks directly up to me because I'm first in line and he shakes my hand and he says, "Hi, I'm Steve." And I'm like a quivering mess. I'm 17 years old. He is my hero. He's my Jesus. And so I was just so high on adrenaline that I just started asking him questions. As soon as we walked in, I basically just stayed at his side, and I just picked his brain about all sorts of different stuff. So it's not like I got to ask him questions about life. I was asking him about the new 17-inch iMac or whatever. But it was a pretty cool experience to get to meet him.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):
That is awesome. There's such a funny thread recently with guests. Everyone, there's like a Steve Jobs connection for the past couple months of guests. That's an awesome story. It just shows that it wasn't luck. You made this happen. You got there first in line.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:25:59):
The lesson for me was ask big and maybe you'll get something great. Ask for amazing, you'll get something great, which I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):
Yes, door in the face technique, I think people call it.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:26:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:12):
Andrew, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out? I know you're buying companies, investing in companies. Just talk about what you're looking for there in case people are like, "Oh, this is me." And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:26:26):
Yeah, my business is Tiny, T-I-N-Y.com, and we buy businesses. Basically, when we sold the business, we hated it. We went through this process where we talked to all these douchebags that ran private equity firms that would show up in our office in suits and use a bunch of words we didn't understand. And we ended up going, "Man, why can't we just sell to somebody who's like us?" And so we basically started Tiny to become the buyer we wish we could have sold to. And we're looking for businesses that have some of the qualities I mentioned before. So really high quality businesses that do something positive in the world and have happy customers, happy employees, and some kind of competitive advantage that will make them continue into the future. So we own AeroPress, Letterboxd, Dribble, which is a design social network, whole bunch of businesses like that. So if somebody is thinking about selling their business, definitely get in touch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):
Amazing. Okay. And then how can listeners be useful to you if it's not just that?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:27:33):
I just would say if there's anyone really interesting coming to Victoria, Canada, which is where I live, send me an email and would love to have coffee with you. The reason I love going on podcasts is because I get to meet so many interesting people, both randomly. If I'm in a cafe and someone sees me and says hi, I often make a lot of friends that way, or if someone comes to my hometown. So yeah, just get in touch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:56):
Amazing. Andrew, thank you so much for being here.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:27:59):
Yeah, thanks, dude. That was fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:00):

## Transcript

Andy Johns (00:00:00):
There are day-to-day stresses that are normal and we just have to put up with, but then there's the other stuff that's the flashing red alarm. Again, you can go back to animals. It's like when their fundamental functions, when their core behaviors of diet, exercise, playfulness, socialization, sleep, when those things get disrupted, it's a sign that there is something going on here that you need to take a look at. 

(00:00:27):
So the same is true with people. If your sleep always sucks, if your relationships are constantly strained or frequently strained, if your physical health is failing, there's so many ways that that can be measured. So there's really no excuse for that to say, "Oh, I just didn't know." I'd say it's to look at those things. When those are suffering or when they're really out of whack, it's undeniable that there is something that is detrimental to your wellbeing that's going on right now, and your body is telling you, "Stop. Something needs to change."

Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Andy Johns. This is going to be a very different type of episode and maybe the most meaningful and important episode of the podcast. 

(00:01:21):
Andy was a legendary product and growth leader at Facebook, Twitter, Quora, and Wealthfront, where he was VP of Growth and VP of Product, and then President, and as you'll hear, was in line to be CEO of Wealthfront until he came to realize that this path was not right for him. After a lot of internal reflection and hard self-work, he changed his entire life's path to becoming a mental health advocate and helping burned out high achievers and also veterans with their mental health journey. 

(00:01:48):
In our conversation, Andy shares his personal story, what true burnout looks like, and when you should pay attention to your mental health. Talks about the process of deep personal transformation and the four steps involved in making lasting change in your life. He also shares how to actually allow change to happen in your life, tactics for moving down this path, and a lot of advice and real talk on mental health and tech.

(00:02:10):
There's a lot of struggle happening in the world right now, including in tech, and so I hope this conversation helps you with your own journey. You can check out Andy's work at Clues.Life. With that, I bring you Andy Johns after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:04:49):
Andy, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. 

Andy Johns (00:04:53):
Thanks, Lenny. Happy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:54):
So I've been both looking forward to our conversation, but I've also been dreading it a little bit because I know it's going to be incredibly valuable, but I also think it's going to get very heavy, and I think it's important to get heavy sometimes, especially with the stuff we're going to be talking about, but just wanted to share that.

Andy Johns (00:05:09):
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to that. I think one of the things that has been a change for me over the last several years is that I prefer to move forward in my life being completely honest with who I am, not hiding any aspects of myself, including the stuff that in the past I'd be afraid to share. 

Lenny (00:05:29):
Well, on that topic, I'd love for you to just walk us through the path that you've taken. Basically, you're like me in a sense. You're helping companies build product, drive growth, worked with some of the best companies in the world, and then things took a turn. So could you just start with a brief overview of what happened? 

Andy Johns (00:05:48):
Sure. So the short background is I spent about 17 years working in the world of startups. I think on the whole, it was a successful experience. I managed to land at a handful of really good companies and had a great experience, but along the way, despite having built somewhat of an impressive resume, I guess you could say, I was also struggling quite a bit in terms of my emotional, psychological, and spiritual health. So in some ways, it feels like the cliche that as my career reached its pinnacle, that from a professional, from a financial perspective, I was at my highest, but when it came to other aspects of my life, I was arguably at my lowest or close to my lowest. 

(00:06:43):
So even though I had those successes, there was a lot that I needed to work through that was under the hood, which I eventually came to understand very, very deeply as a result of turning inward and doing a lot of work on my own path towards self-understanding and healing some deep emotional wounds.

Lenny (00:07:04):
In a post that you worked on for my newsletter back in the day, you shared this story of, I think maybe it was at Wealthfront where you were giving a big presentation. Maybe share that story?

Andy Johns (00:07:14):
Sure. I can share that. It actually goes back to ... This is 2010. I was at Twitter at the time. I was in my late 20s. Again, my career was going really well. I was starting to string together a series of successful experiences, and I was suddenly hit with near constant panic, panic attacks, depression. I was having a very, very difficult time sleeping and just managing my emotions as a whole. It got to the point to where there were several occasions while I was at work where I could tell that I was about ready to have a breakdown of sorts, and I would just grab my laptop, throw it in my bag, and pretty quietly just walk out of the office even if it was 10:00 AM and I'd only been there for an hour or two. That happened on multiple occasions. 

(00:08:07):
There were some occasions in which I was set up to go and speak to the entire company during an all-hands session, and it was something where I just had to come up with an excuse and bow out of it because at the time, I was already completely overcome and overwhelmed by this near constant panic I was experiencing, but I had a really good poker face, I don't think most people could see it.

(00:08:34):
To give a little bit of an explanation and to tie first question together with this, there were two major things that contributed to me having a pretty acute case of burnout and needing to step away from my career as I knew it. The first was just the slow and steady accumulation of the pressure, the stresses, the anxieties, the emotional ups and downs that came from having such a strong commitment to my career, and frankly an addiction to achievement as a way to feel good and to feel whole, but I was so focused on my work that I had slowly become the frog that was boiling in the pot, the typical analogy of you don't realize how bad things are getting because it's happening to you slowly until it happens quickly, right?

(00:09:38):
So on one hand, I was not only struggling emotionally and psychologically because of the pressures of the career and climbing the ladder and just the common existential angst that comes with being at a startup and not knowing what the future holds. What I later came to understand was that I was also starting to experience and to address old emotional pain that I'd buried for a very long time, stemming back to the death of my mom when I was 10. She was severely mentally ill. She was bipolar, had bouts of psychosis, and had spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals. I can remember going to those hospitals as some of my earliest memories as a kid.

(00:10:33):
So there was a lot of disruption in my childhood, a lot of neglect, some occasional abuse, and then it culminated with the loss of the most important female figure in my life when I was 10. Of course, like anyone else after that, I was in a lot of pain emotionally, but as a kid, you don't have the tools or even the capabilities to effectively process something as significant and traumatic as an experience like that. 

(00:11:11):
So my mind did what the mind of most children will do, which is it finds a way to bury it or to ignore it. The thing that I had latched onto that made me feel better was that anytime I hit a home run or scored a goal or got straight A's and was just basically a stellar student and a stellar athlete, I was showered with love, not only from my family, which is fantastic, but from society at large, especially within the world that we live in.

(00:11:44):
So I learned very early on that if I wanted to feel good, I needed to achieve, and that if I wanted to love myself and be considered lovable by others, I needed to achieve. That pulled me out of a darkness that I was in for several years as a kid, and I'm glad that it did, and it led to an excellent experience in high school, in college, and then well into my 20s, but eventually, those emotional wounds are going to come to the surface. They're going to come up for error, and when they do, it's going to be difficult, and that's what happened with me. 

(00:12:24):
So it was really two things coming together at the same time. It was the growing pressures of an escalating career within the dynamic industry, but then also, I think, the natural maturation of my mind and of adult development such that it was time for that old pain to come to the surface, and when it did, it was very disruptive and it's something that I'm still continuing to work on to this day.

Lenny (00:12:55):
I imagine many people listening either resonate with some of this or just like, "This is exactly the life I'm living." I know you work with people now helping them through these challenges, especially in tech. So two questions there. One is just you've done polls around this. Just what percentage of people in tech have you seen struggle with these sorts of things on some degree?

Andy Johns (00:13:16):
For the last two years, I've been doing a lot of writing, and most of my writing has really just been me opening up and sharing this personal side of what was going on behind the scenes. Along the way, I've been able to connect with, at this point, hundreds of folks in the tech industry who are dealing with their own forms of burnout or their own deep existential questions that are coming to the surface and they're trying to understand them.

(00:13:48):
So from some of the surveys I've put out from my own anecdotal experience and from some proper research that's been conducted by experts who focus on entrepreneur and high performer wellbeing, I'd say that it's a fair estimate to say that at least 50% to 60% of tech employees who have, just to give it a bit more nuance, who have been in the saddle, so to speak, for a minimum of five to seven years, they're experiencing some form of psychological and emotional distress. It may be minor enough such that they think it's just day-to-day anxiety, but it's often much more significant than people realize because, again, it creeps up on you slowly and then all of a sudden it hits you quickly.

Lenny (00:14:42):
We're going to dive into what this looks like and ways you've found to be helpful to people. One last question before we get there. You walked away from a pretty senior incredible role, and in the post that you wrote, you shared the salary you gave up in that giving up. Can you just talk about what that last role was and then what you had to give up to change career paths and [inaudible 00:15:05]

Andy Johns (00:15:04):
Yeah. So one of the things that I did towards the tail end of my career as I became a consumer or founding partner of the consumer arm of an early stage venture capital firm, and most folks know that especially once a fund gets big enough, it can be a high paying job. Suddenly, I found myself in a position where I was making high six figures per year into early seven figures. When I look back on it in retrospect, I had put in so much effort to get to that point really going back to when I was 10 years old, having always been the straight A student and captain of whatever team I was on. 

(00:15:46):
From the age of 10 to basically 35, I was switched on, constantly seeking to perform at the top of whatever my field was. So I gotten to that point first as an executive at a high growth startup, that was Wealthfront, and I became president and was next in line to be CEO before I had a health scare with my heart that led to me stepping away from the company because I knew I couldn't take on the CEO position. Then here I was six or seven months later, again, very subconsciously driven by the desire to succeed because underneath that was the sense that I wasn't lovable unless I was succeeding. 

(00:16:30):
Here I was after a heart attack scare at the age of 35 sweeping that under the carpet like I'd swept so much stuff under the carpet and choosing to join on as a founding partner of a venture capital firm, which is not an easy job at all, and especially when you're starting a new firm up, it's, in a lot of ways, it's a company in and of its own. So it was another startup. It was my sixth startup in a row. 

(00:16:59):
So three years into that though, even though I was working on my own mental health and my emotional wellbeing, I had convinced myself repeatedly for so many years that everything was okay and that I could continue to put my head down and run through these walls, these professional walls and keep going, but it got to a point to where that was no longer the case. 

(00:17:32):
In fact, it was the culmination of conversations with my doctors and with the experts that I've been working with where I ended up actually spending 45 days in a mental health institute myself. It was something that was extremely difficult to do. It was something that certainly contributed or was really the tip of the sphere of me stepping away from my career of realizing that the only reason I was continuing to push forward despite how poorly I felt on the inside was because of stuff that had happened to me when I was much younger and because of the fallible nature of the human mind and how it wants to interpret experiences and ways that can become so self-critical and self damaging.

(00:18:32):
So that happened for me roughly three years ago. Needless to say, my life has changed quite a bit since then, and I'm happy to chat more about that, but that was a difficult decision to walk away from my career at the peak of it, but I guess the takeaway, and then I'll stop for a bit, is it's important for people to understand that there are formative experiences in our lives which put us in positions to where we form adaptations in order to survive, just like my attachment to achievement and how my self-worth was entirely tied up in that.

(00:19:14):
I needed that when I was younger because I was heartbroken, I lost a parent, and that adaptation that I formed saved my life when I was young, and it gave me a great childhood after that, and a great next couple of decades, but these adaptations, if you're unaware of them and if you're unaware of the subconscious drivers that are responsible for them, they run the risk that they go too far, and that these adaptations, which were initially beneficial to you and to your life, they reverse course in a sense, and they become detrimental to your present state and your future development. 

(00:20:04):
So my stepping away from the career, stepping away from the high salary, and stepping away from everything I'd worked so hard to obtain was an action that I took in recognition of the fact that that early life adaptation had now gone awry and was responsible for my life heading in a negative direction and it was time to change.

Lenny (00:20:30):
The gift of your experience going through all that is that now we can all benefit learning from that. You spend your time these days helping people get over a lot of these challenges that they have. Can you just talk about what it is you spend your time on specifically? Then let's unpack the process that you've come up with to help people through this.

Andy Johns (00:20:52):
Now, when people ask me what I do, I say I do mental health advocacy, and I do it in a few ways. One is I sit on the board of a nonprofit called Heroic Hearts Project, and what we do is we raise money so that we can pay for military veterans with PTSD to get access to alternative therapies, namely psychedelic assisted psychotherapy. It was started by a handful of veterans. I was lucky enough to meet a few of them a couple of years ago. Given my own personal experience with PTSD stemming from my childhood experiences, I was bonded together with these men and women of the Armed Forces who had, in many cases, not only their own personal trauma, but also war trauma. So that's one organization that I'm thankful to be able to work with and help out. 

(00:21:48):
I also write my newsletter and have created a new website that I'm toying with. In general, my writing and the content that I've put out is focused on the unhappy achievers, the other folks like myself who are out there, which there's quite a few of us. I write in order to express my personal experience because I think there's many others that can relate. So those are the things that I've been working on and a little bit of coaching with some of the high performers as well.

Lenny (00:22:23):
Throw out the website in case people want to check it out while we're talking.

Andy Johns (00:22:26):
The website that I'm playing around with is called Clues.Life, clues as in questions, clues, not truth dot life or facts dot life. I called it Clues Dot Life for a reason because if there's one thing that I've learned in my own personal journey, it's that given the immense heterogeneity of the human population and how we're all born unique and then we're made further unique through our own individual life experiences, the thing that's clear to me is that if somebody is going through their own struggles, at the end of the day, they have to find the philosophies, the tools, and the methods that work for them. 

(00:23:08):
You can read plenty of studies, you can read the books, you can listen to what others are doing, but at the end of the day, you got to personalize it to yourself. So that's why I called it Clues Dot Life because I'm building this library of mental health information that allows people to navigate all of this information in search of their own clues.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Awesome, and we'll link to that in the show notes, but it's an easy URL to remember. Something you spent a lot of your time on as you've talked about is helping people through deep personal transformation. That's the way you describe it. What is involved in that process of someone going through a deep personal transformation?

Andy Johns (00:23:47):
I love this question. So most of the conversations I have are with folks who are going through significant change. Now, what's involved in that? It can happen on a spectrum where everyone's process is unique. We all change and unfold in identical ways. Some can go through subtle shifts. I've heard this referred to as a micro transition, where, for example, they may be working at a tech industry or at a tech company, but this specific company they're working at, they have no real values connection to it. So part of their suffering is the fact that they feel that the work that they're doing doesn't really matter or they don't feel a connection to it. So switching to work at a different company that's aligned with something that's consistent with their values, that may be enough for somebody to go through a small transition and then find themselves in a happier place. 

(00:24:52):
The transitions that I talk about are the big fundamental ones like the transition that I've been going through myself. Now, what's involved in that? I think that there are four parts, just to give it a simple general framework. Step one is it begins with suffering. These large transitions in life rarely take place in the absence of suffering. So step number one is suffer. Usually, the deeper somebody suffers, the more significant the transition that may follow. There's a reason why in the 12 steps community like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, you name it, there's a reason that rock bottom is in the vernacular because rock bottom tends to proceed somebody getting sober. So step one is suffering. 

(00:25:53):
Step two is seeking the truth behind why we suffer. Once the suffering gets so bad in somebody through some spiritual intervention, a legal intervention, the intervention of friends and family, whatever it may be, they decide to change, and in order to change, you have to understand the truth as to who you are and why you are the way you are and why you're suffering. The answer lies in understanding the truth, and that is usually a long process. Digging through the subconscious mind, digging through your history and your past, digging through your relationships, that takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of time to remove the mental blocks that we might've spent decades developing such that we don't even see these patterns that we play out regularly. 

(00:26:51):
So first, you begin with suffering, and then second, you seek the truth for your suffering. What I have found, and that leads to step three in the process, is that once you discover the truth of your suffering, the real root cause of it and where it came from, that's when you move to step three, which is you begin to experience and to practice self-compassion and self-love because inevitably, what you discover through this process of seeking the truth is that your suffering isn't necessarily your fault. Maybe you're suffering because of things that you experienced or had to go through of which you had no control over.

(00:27:44):
Nonetheless, it's common for the mind, especially the mind of a child, to interpret those less than nurturing experiences as, "This happened because of me." So what sits at the core of their suffering is not only a low sense of self, but a shame, a shame regarding who they are and who they believe themselves to be. 

(00:28:08):
When you dig deep enough into your own self-understanding, eventually you'll discover that that's not true, that it isn't your fault, that these things swept you up like a wave, and you were just along for a ride of which you had no choice. When you understand that and you start to feel a sense of forgiveness and to begin to love yourself for the first time, you make this switch where then you're willing to live in a way that is more consistent with self-love and self-compassion. 

(00:28:45):
So me, for example, stepping away from my career, at the end of the day, I wasn't running from something, I was running back towards myself. That was an act of kindness towards myself. Going into a 45-day hospitalization, that was an act of love. So what ends up happening is the truth fuels that process of self-love, and when you begin to live in a way that is consistent with valuing yourself and understanding that it's not your fault, then that's when you move to step four, which is compassion towards others because by understanding yourself and realizing the true nature of why you are the way you are and forgiving yourself because you understand it's not your fault, guess what? You see the same thing in everybody else. 

(00:29:46):
This is what is meant when folks sometimes say we're all adults or we're all children walking around in adult bodies, right? We're just acting out the things that were done to us in the past because when I think of the human mind, there are many ways that you can describe what the brain is, but one way that I describe it certainly is that it's autobiographical. It tries to predict what's going to happen next based on what happened in the past. It's a prediction engine. That's what it does, and that's why I say it's autobiographical because the way that you present yourself to the world as an adult is a reflection of what happened to you in the past, the messages you were told, the ways you were conditioned by society, maybe the traumas you experienced. 

(00:30:36):
So that's the process as I see it of deep, deep, deep transformation. It's that four-step process of the suffering, the seeking of truth, the living in a way that is compassionate towards oneself, and then living in a way that is compassionate towards others. When you do that, you change. Think of that as the horizontal foundation to which the rest of your external life is built. The place you choose to live, the partner you choose to have, the friends you have, the career you have, all of these things are erections on top of a foundation of identity, and that identity is what is completely rewired when somebody goes through that four-step process, and as a result, everything that's built on top of that identity, it doesn't necessarily have to change, but it might.

Lenny (00:31:41):
That feels like a reason somebody wouldn't want to go down this journey of, "I don't want to change everything about myself."

Andy Johns (00:31:48):
Yes, and this is the power of the human mind at work or what someone referred to as the ego. As soon as the ego senses that something wants to challenge it and to undermine its authority, it finds a way to push it away. It finds a way to ignore it because it is a very difficult process. I now understand what some philosophers described as death before dying. In this process of change that I've been going through, it's been the death of the old me, the death of Andy whose identity was entirely attached to succeeding, and that old Andy doesn't want to let go. It's been around for a few decades. It believes that it's there to protect me. 

(00:32:46):
This is a survival mechanism that's somewhat gone awry within the context of modern life. So it doesn't want to let go, but that's what I've been doing. That's the process I've been going through is slowly but surely finding a way to take my fingers off the steering wheel and to let that old sense of self die, and then in doing so create the room for what's next, whatever that may be. I'm three years into the process of discovering what that will be. So we'll see.

Lenny (00:33:24):
Thinking through these four steps, suffering sounds like people will just do that naturally, potentially, and I feel like it gets hard at the understanding the source of that suffering. I guess, one, is that true or do people try to resist that suffering and are just like, "Nah, it's okay, it's okay," and they white knuckle it?

Andy Johns (00:33:45):
I think you're pretty spot on with it. This dips into a lot of the ancient Eastern spiritual traditions of just this recognition that life involves suffering. One way or another, there's going to be suffering. I think of it as there's two types of suffering. There's the necessary suffering like we're going to get old and our bodies are going to hurt and we're going to have physical ailments and toothaches and shit's just going to happen and we're going to lose the people we love, all of us, and the 80 to a hundred billion homo sapiens that live before us gone through the same thing. 

(00:34:29):
So there is necessary suffering in life or the mandatory suffering, and then there's the unnecessary suffering, which is the suffering that is almost entirely, and I think the argument could be made that it's entirely made up in our minds. This is the superpowers of the human mind gone awry again in the modern context. So there's going to be a lot of suffering one way or another. I think if there's a goal or objective, it's to minimize the unnecessary suffering, but the seeking of the truth part is very difficult. It takes years.

(00:35:10):
There's a reason that, again, in some of these spiritual traditions, let's take Buddhism for example, there's a reason that there's so much structure and discipline and there's a daily method that they adhere to because it turns out it takes daily practice. In the same way that if you want to get extremely fit and climb Mount Everest, that's not something you do by just getting off the couch, right? It takes a dedication to it. I think that the seeking of truth takes that dedication, and that's, again, why I believe that the first step is almost always suffering because to undergo that process of personal transformation, which can be very difficult, and it can feel like you're in a life raft and you've just pushed away from the shore completely untethered, uncertain of where you're floating. In order to work up the courage to get to that point, things typically have to get pretty bad.

(00:36:09):
You say, "I can't fucking do this anymore. I'm not going to live like this. Something's got to change." So much of that seeking of the truth is actually at first driven by intense fear, fear of going back to how bad things were and feeling that bad again. Eventually, the process changes tone when you move past the fear stage and you understand yourself enough and then you start to look forward optimistically towards the future, where instead of just being driven by fear, you're also pulled forward by a vision for the future that inspires you. So that eventually comes, but to begin with, yes, this process of discovering the truth is very, very, very, very difficult. It requires a personal commitment. It's not something anyone else can do for you.

Lenny (00:37:02):
With that context in mind that it's very difficult, I imagine many people listening are like, "Yes, I have a lot of suffering that I'm going through. Life is hard, work is hard, work is too crazy," especially product managers and founders that listen to this podcast.

Andy Johns (00:37:19):
I know. To all the VPs of Product out there, I'm so sorry. I've been in your shoes.

Lenny (00:37:24):
So with that, say someone wanted to go down this path and understand the truth of what is the source of this suffering that you even described as unnecessary and made up, what would the first couple steps be of knowing that it's going to take years potentially of how to actually try to understand this?

Andy Johns (00:37:40):
Commonly in the West, the first step that makes a lot of sense is you turn to somebody who's trained in helping you figure out what those truths are, which is a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a counselor. Sometimes people turn to religious or spiritual leaders because they can be quite gifted in this as well. That's the most common step. 

(00:38:02):
That's the first step that I turn to when I was just completely stricken by panic and terrified that I might harm myself. I said, "I got to figure out what the hell's going on because I can't live feeling like this," and all I knew to do was reach out to a therapist, and that is a wonderful first start because if anything, they're not going to have all the answers, but they can act like a router, where as they're helping you understand yourself and they're really understanding you, they're thinking about, "Okay. Who might this person also benefit from speaking with? Let's route them to this person that specializes in body-based work, somatic work. Let's send this person to somebody that specializes in nervous system management through breath work or other things." So seeking a therapist is a pretty good first step.

Lenny (00:39:00):
Any advice on how to figure out who the right therapist or wrong therapist is for you? I know you've actually shared somewhere on LinkedIn once that there's also a lot of disagreement within the mental health community of what is the right approach and what's the right solution.

Andy Johns (00:39:13):
It's like speed dating at first because I would argue that the most important factor is that you feel safe. Animals can teach us so much about what it means to heal ourselves. Imagine going to the pound and you go in there and there's a bunch of dogs that have been picked up off the street or that have been abandoned, and the vast majority of them, they're a nervous wreck, right? Their tail is down in between their legs. They're hunched over and they might be shaking. Their nervous system is completely overwhelmed. That is not the time to teach a dog tricks. When the dog still can't come out the corner of the kennel is not the time to teach it how to sit. Once that dog can make it into the arms of an owner that it feels safe with and loved by, that's when you see the dog transform and change, and that's when you can teach it a lot because it's open and receptive to it.

(00:40:21):
So that's number one in my advice is speed date if you've got the opportunity to and try out a few therapists and just go based on intuition, what just feels right to you, and you're going to want to fall into that feeling of comfort. Now, a quick asterisk on that. Of course if you're in real distress, if you're in a bad place, just see whatever professional you can as soon as possible. That's what I did. I was fortunate to where the first one that I saw was also fantastic. I ended up seeing many other specialists over the years, but that first one, she was wonderful.

(00:41:05):
So it's essential that you feel comfortable with them. I would also say, this one's a little controversial, but you're going to want a therapist that is at least as intelligent, if not more intelligent than you because I think part of that openness to learning from them and to feeling somewhat comfortable but also feeling inspired and looking forward to it as if sometimes they say things that make you say, "Oh, shit. Wow. Wow, I never thought of that. That was smart," or, "That was a wonderful insight." I don't think if you respect their intellectual abilities, then it's going to be difficult for them to help you. They may not be able to communicate on the same wavelength. So you really want to look for that intuitive feeling of something that is safe and comfortable. Ideally, if you can find somebody with some intellectual horsepower that matches your own, honestly, I think the rest after that is just implementation details.

Lenny (00:42:11):
If someone maybe isn't ready for a therapist and that's something about that just holds them back, is there another route that you would recommend people take or is it just go straight to a therapist?

Andy Johns (00:42:23):
Absolutely. Absolutely. If you're not in a state of distress, but you feel like there's something to be figured out, there's an ancient technology known as pen and paper. At the end of the day, the seeking of the truth involves the seeking of a deep sense of self-understanding, and if you can get into the daily practice of being able to sit down with pen and paper and write to yourself, to ask yourself questions, to really sit there and evaluate the thoughts that are running through your head, it is possible for somebody to, and I'll use the term, I won't get into it, but to reach some state of bliss or enlightenment or some real spiritual awakening, it is possible for somebody to do that entirely on their own with just pen and paper and a quiet room. 

(00:43:20):
I know people that have arrived at a deep place of self-love and self-understanding through those methods, and I know a lot of others, including myself, where the writing to others was really the writing to myself 15 years ago as a way for me to continue to understand myself more deeply. So I think pen and paper is deeply, deeply overlooked and underrated in this process.

Lenny (00:43:48):
Say you get a pen and paper, is there some guide or framework or something you'd point people to you to think through what to think about and how to approach this?

Andy Johns (00:43:58):
Yeah. There are different ways of doing it. Some advocate for a completely unstructured approach because what you want is you don't want to turn it into assignment. You want to feel your way into it. If something is bubbling up in your mind, just spit it out. Don't analyze why it's coming up, just allow it to flow. That method certainly works. Sit down with no agenda. On some days you'll write one sentence and that's enough, and on other days you'll write 10 pages and that's also enough. There's some magic to allowing the human mind to just work and to not interrupt it through some analytical process. 

(00:44:40):
On the flip side, if you want a little bit more structure, one thing you can do is I'd like to start with if the goal is to understand oneself, then one of the quickest ways of doing that is to quickly write down a list of simple bullet points of the most recent situations you can think of where you became most acutely reactionary and emotional. You could have been having a political conversation with somebody and they said something that really just you felt like you just wanted to reach out and strangle them. You could have felt deeply insecure in a social setting. 

(00:45:24):
Just run through those scenarios where something disrupted what might've been your current state of presence and calmness. When you identify those situations where there was some strong reaction, that is very revealing because that wasn't a conscious thought process that led to the reaction. That was a knee-jerk reaction. That was a reflex. If there's a reflex, then there's something that's underlying the reflex, and the question to then ask is, "Why did that happen?" 

(00:45:58):
Then from there, it's an unstructured process. Keep asking, keep digging, keep asking, "Okay. If this happened, why did that happen? Well ..." and then write a little bit, "Well, is that really the reason why? Was there something else?" Just keep working at it until you hit the truth, and you'll know what the truth is because it always feels either deeply uncomfortable or it feels like an epiphany.

Lenny (00:46:26):
Wow. For you that was recognizing that it was about your mom.

Andy Johns (00:46:32):
There were many parts of it. At its core, at first it began with a simple truth, which was I went into the therapist, I was describing what I was feeling, I was describing the uncontrollable thoughts and mental imagery that I was experiencing, and my sleep disruption, and my pounding heart, and everything else, and she said, "Yup, you're having panic attacks," and just knowing like, "Oh, there's a thing and it's called a panic attack," starting at that basic truth was enough in the moment to just take a little bit of the edge off. 

(00:47:18):
So this journey along the way is there are dozens of truths and then hundreds of truths, and then every now and then it's punctuated by the big, "Oh, holy shit. I never saw that coming," kind of truth. It's just what the experience is. I had many, many truths about myself that I discovered before I hit some of the fundamental ones that were at the core of my subconscious.

Lenny (00:47:48):
Following in that thread, what are signs that you're in need of this transformation versus, "Work is just stressful. Things are hard. I have some challenging meetings," which a lot of people go through on and off? I've had a lot of those. What are signs maybe you're boarding out or something that requires, "Wow, I really need to dig a lot deeper"?

Andy Johns (00:48:09):
There are day-to-day stresses that are normal and we just have to put up with, but then there's the other stuff that's the flashing red alarm. For me, and a lot of the research and literature supports this too, is, again, you can go back to animals. It's like when their fundamental functions, when their core behaviors of diet, exercise, playfulness, socialization, sleep, when those things get disrupted, it's a sign that there is something going on here that you need to take a look at. 

(00:48:49):
So the same is true with people. If your sleep always sucks, if your relationships are constantly strained or frequently strained, if your physical health is failing, there's so many ways that that can be measured so there's really no excuse for that to say, "Oh, I just didn't know," I'd say it's to look at those things. When those are suffering or when they're really out of whack, it's undeniable that there is something that is detrimental to your wellbeing that's going on right now, and your body is telling you, "Stop. Something needs to change." So that is number one to look at. Look at the fundamentals.

(00:49:43):
Reflecting on my own situation, I almost had a heart attack at 35, and I got the classic talk from a Stanford cardiologist saying, "You're just going to be another 40-something-year-old CEO with a broken heart." The years of really poor sleep, the number of teeth that I had broken that I had to have fixed multiple times because for years my grinding was so bad that I had to, now two times over, had to completely redo all the teeth, all my molars, and then most of the front teeth as well, and I just continued to move forward even though my body was, again, throwing out all the signals.

(00:50:31):
For anyone who's listening to this, especially for the folks who haven't, go get the book, The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. He's a expert clinician who's worked with trauma patients for decades, and the entire book is basically one big message saying, "Hey, when mental health presents itself, look to the body because it's the body that is keeping the score." It's the body that's the scoreboard, and it's the body that is actually holding on to all of this shit you've been carrying for years, and eventually, the body breaks in the form of chronic disease and illness and so on and so forth.

Lenny (00:51:12):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people have published in the Miroverse. When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works.

(00:51:56):
Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O dot com slash Lenny. 

(00:52:22):
We've talked about the suffering step, then the understanding the truth of what is going on. Say someone sits down in a room, writes out what's going on, has this epiphany of, "Oh, wow, it's really this moment in my childhood that really led me to need to achieve and do all these things." The next step is self-compassion and recognizing that it's not your fault. That sounds very easy on the surface like, "Okay. I understand this is not my fault." I know it's not that easy. How do you go about actually deeply doing that steps?

Andy Johns (00:52:56):
It's likely this deeply internalized self-belief. You can think of that as one of the deepest grooves in the neural pathways in your mind. Now, that was the case for me, so deep that you don't even realize that it's there, it's omnipresent. It's going to take time to rewire that because what you're effectively trying to do is take an internal narrative and edit and rewrite that thing, and this internal narrative is probably at a foothold in you for years or decades. So it's reasonable to believe or to understand that, "Okay. If I have not had a high opinion of myself for 30 years, that's not going to change overnight." 

(00:53:50):
For some people, it miraculously does. That's not the norm. For most others, including myself, it starts with that truth stage because with truth is the awareness, "Okay. I understand that I have a low sense of self-worth, and I understand that it plays out in all these ways, and I have the awareness of it that now when I'm doing something that is a conditioned behavior or a conditioned response born out of that deep self-belief or that negative core belief, then when I spot it, there's an opportunity for me to intervene," and it starts in the simple ways. 

(00:54:31):
For example, I had a boss once where he would come over and he would give me praise all the time. He was wonderful human being, and I think I was doing a good job. One day, he swung by, he said, "Hey, amazing job," and my response was, "Oh, yeah, I did my best," and then he looked at me and he said, "Hey, say thank you or you're welcome. That's it. When somebody gives you a compliment, just say thanks, accept it." So it's become a pattern of mine now that if somebody gives me a compliment, I look them in the eyes and I say, "Thank you," and I really try and embrace that little moment because it's in all of those ways where you identify these little patterns, you intercept them, and you choose to make a change to how you're conditioned to behave in that moment. If you do that consistently enough and you keep practicing it, and you keep it up every day, then you're developing a new internal narrative through all those little actions, and it accumulates in ways that are pretty powerful. 

(00:55:43):
Every now and then, there's things that you can do that are more of a brute force method of driving that home. Some may find it through a Vipassana retreat, a seven to 10-day silent retreat, which is agonizing if folks haven't tried to be that quiet that long. Things bubble up, you confront the stuff in your mind that in our day-to-day, it's easy to just keep it under the hood. Some find that through psychedelics. Some find that through somewhat extreme physical feats. 

(00:56:22):
There was a period in time where I didn't realize this at the time, but not only was I building my career, but I was running ultra marathons. Looking back at that I was like, "Yeah, there I was, another desperate attempt to feel worthy," but I also recognize now that that was medicine for me, that me going out onto a remote mountain range for five hours every Saturday and just running well beyond the point of discomfort was consistently cathartic for me. I would cry at the end of almost every single one of those runs. So it's just a recap. It's in those little moments and sometimes in those big moments too, but it begins with the awareness based on truth and then the daily practice.

Lenny (00:57:17):
How long does this process often take for people that you've worked with?

Andy Johns (00:57:21):
There are some famous figures that you can turn to. For example, Eckhart Tolle. He wrote The Power of Now, which he's probably most famous for. He's a great Western spiritual teacher of Eastern traditions. He went through immense suffering himself. Actually, the suffering was so great that for him it led to a somewhat sudden and spontaneous collapse of his sense of identity. Doctors would probably say psychosis, and what he actually had was a spiritual liberation, liberation from his mind, but he describes it himself. In reading his book and listening to some of his lectures and talking about his own journey, he wrote this at, I think, in the first chapter or the preface of The Power of Now when he described the suffering that he was experiencing and the sudden collapse of this sense of identity, and then waking up the next day and feeling this deep sense of peace and freedom for the first time in his life.

(00:58:28):
Then his journey continued to unfold. He eventually started to research to try and understand, "What had just happened to me? What experience did I have?" and dot, dot, dot. Seven years later, he woke up one day and realized he was now a spiritual teacher, seven years. It's not that the journey had ended, but to use a metaphor of two mountains and a valley, that first mountain in his life when he got off of that mountain and he entered this valley, between the first mountain of life and the second mountain of life, the valley that he was in that sat between the old sense of self and then this new sense of self as a spiritual teacher, that valley was seven years for him. 

(00:59:22):
There are many other examples I can pull up like that, including Siddhartha Gautama, Lord Buddha himself. That wasn't a couple weeks or a couple of months, his journey towards liberation from his own mind. If I can recall, that was also a seven or eight-year journey. So these big shifts on a cosmic universal scale, it's instantaneous, right? On the scale of-

Lenny (00:59:50):
[inaudible 00:59:50] context.

Andy Johns (00:59:50):
Yeah. On the scale of 13 billion years, it's instant, but from our perspective, it's not. It feels a lot longer than that.

Lenny (01:00:00):
I want to close the loop on these four steps that you shared, and the one we haven't talked about yet is the last one, which is building compassion towards others. How do you go about that just broadly? I know we're not going to solve that problem for people in the podcast.

Andy Johns (01:00:14):
For me, my experience was that it happened automatically. When you do the first three, it is the result. It's the thing that comes out of step number three itself because, again, when you dig deep enough and you keep searching for the truth, you're like Captain Ahab going down with the white whale in Moby Dick. That is what that book is about. It's not about a fisherman going after a whale. This is the author himself through a story talking about his own journey of emotional and spiritual liberation. 

(01:00:57):
There are many people that would, experts and historians that might disagree with that, and I would disagree with them that it's a story of seeking the truth at all costs to liberate oneself, including being willing to die for that whale, metaphorically, because at the end of the book, they don't really reveal. Did Ahab actually go down with the whale and never come back? Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. 

(01:01:27):
So when you have suffered enough and the search for the truth becomes the only thing that matters and that truth leads you to understanding that, "It's okay. I can accept myself for who I am and it's not all my fault," when that has been done in earnest and when you feel those moments of love for yourself, it suddenly changes how you see everybody else. For me, step four was the easiest because it just happened. It happened after eight years, nine years of my own on and off mental health journey, but it finally happened.

Lenny (01:02:19):
People who are listening to this say they're a VP of Product and they're like, "I don't want to become a spiritual teacher. I want to stay on this path. I want to have a successful career. I want to continue to make a bunch of money." How often do you find there's a path to stay on that path with a rejiggering of how you see the world or does it, if you're suffering enough, does it almost always lead to something completely different in your experience?

Andy Johns (01:02:46):
Again, it's a spectrum. What I've experienced is that the vast majority of people who feel some tug to undergo a process of change, I'd say 90%, 95% of the time pretty confidently I can say that those changes are more of the micro transitions. It's, "Okay. Let me change my job. Let me downsize my house. Let me break up with my partner." Still hard things, and for them, that may be all that is needed and necessary. There's no moral judgment on my side about everyone's got to dive into the deep end. That's certainly not the case, and I'm not advocating for it. I honestly don't even know if it's a choice. There's a part of me that, based on some of the experiences I've had, believes that it was somewhat preordained and that this was going to happen for me, but it's in the minority of cases where the radical transformation of one's sense of identity takes place. It's not common. My general sense is it's definitely less than 1% of the population, and I suspect that's just the way things are.

Lenny (01:04:11):
One of those ends up being Buddha, and one of those ends up being Andy Johns.

Andy Johns (01:04:16):
Yeah, or another popular figure in Western spirituality is Pema Chödrön, who she's got a lot of great books. One of them is titled When Things Fall Apart, some of the first books I read when things fell apart for me. Her story, actually, she used to live in Berkeley, I think, but an American woman. She was married. First marriage didn't work out. She got married again. Second one didn't work out. It ended in somewhat sudden and expected and catastrophic fashion. Here she is with a few children and a broken heart again and deep emotional suffering, and that suffering was so great that it led her to ultimately say, "I must pursue these teachings and this spiritual tradition that I'm starting to wake up to in the Eastern traditions," with Buddhism in particular because she had suffered so much that she needed to find liberation from that.

(01:05:25):
In her case, that even meant separating, not all the time, but a significant portion of her time away from her own children who, if I recall correctly, were early teens timeframe. Now, I think that Pema Chödrön is the only female Buddhist nun in all of North America and is a very well-known spiritual teacher. I also think her journey was somewhere around seven or eight years. Again, that's just the valley between two mountains. Truthfully, the journey continues for the rest of your life, but just another example I wanted to share.

Lenny (01:06:06):
There's some obvious reasons why going down this path is difficult, why making change is hard. What else would you say holds people back from making a big change in their life, and maybe on the flip side is just how do you allow change to happen?

Andy Johns (01:06:20):
A significant thing that holds people back from change is the inertia of civilization because we all experience a fundamental conflict in our life because when we're born, we have many needs, but there are two substantial needs that are immutable in everyone, especially children. The first need is the need for love, acceptance, and connection for mammals. We have one of the longest gestation periods of the entire animal kingdom, and even when we're born, we're helpless, we can't survive. We need nurturing for many, many more years afterwards in order to survive. 

(01:07:13):
That goes hand-in-hand with our need for connection. So we're biologically hardwired to need to be accepted and connected because it is perhaps the most essential thing to survival, more essential than water. So we're born with that need. Yet at the same time, we're also born as unique individuals. 

(01:07:37):
I read a study where the scientists estimated the probability that two sperm or two egg would be genetically identical. For context, I think the average man generates in their prime somewhere around between 10 to 100 million sperm a day. So we generate a lot of sperm in our lifetime. The math that they came up with was that the probability of two sperm being identical is roughly 10 to the 15th power, which is a million times greater than the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. There's somewhere between 100 to 400 billion stars in the galaxy. So it's a million times greater than that. So all that is to say is when you were born, you were unique. There's never been a you before ever, and it's going to be a really, really long time or another dimension before another one of you shows up again. 

(01:08:32):
Then further through the socialization of life, we all have unique experiences, and those experiences are passed through this unique prism of our own mind and genetics to where we're further accentuated as individuals. So we're born with this fundamental need to be connected and to be loved, but we're also born with this need to be ourselves and to express ourselves. What ends up happening though is the world that you're born into eventually conditions you away from the unique individual that you were, and that is the function of society. 

(01:09:09):
Society operates because enough people choose to agree on the same beliefs and ideas around the style of education, of raising children, of city planning, of millions of things. So the substrate of society or the adhesive of it is shared belief. So that's why I say the inertia of civilization or I should have said the inertia of society is because you're born into a world that begins to condition you at a very early age to act a certain way and not act a certain way, believe some things and don't believe others. 

(01:09:48):
Why am I a San Francisco Giants fan? Well, because I grew up in a Giants family. It's not like I was two years old and I picked the Giants. It doesn't work that way. What ends up happening then is, and this begins, again, really young. You're two, three, four, five years old and the world around you, namely the adults in the world, start telling you who to be, and it begins to challenge or run into conflict with that individuality, but because our fear of not being accepted and loved is so great that what do we end up doing? We choose to push down our individuality in exchange for being accepted by the pack, beginning with our parents, and then our friends, and then our teachers, and then our bosses, and all of the other dimensions of society. 

(01:10:42):
So we lose who we were before the world told us who to be. It's actually a Carl Jung quote, "The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, it'll tell you." So I would say that that is the number one reason why transformation doesn't take place. It's because a long time ago, we made that exchange to forego our individuality in order to be accepted by others because of that deep primal need for love and acceptance. In order to undertake that process of personal transformation, one of the truths you have to realize is that truth, that truth that you are in large part the way you are but because of what the world told you to be, and it's making the choice consciously to then say, "Fuck that, and I'm going to go against the grain and I'm going to now tell the world that I don't want its influence on me anymore, and I will, like Moby Dick or like Ahab going down with the white whale, I am willing to die to return to my individuality and to break free and to be who I want to be in the face of the currents around us regarding the messages around how we should think, live, act, and feel." 

(01:12:11):
So that is the thing that prevents transformation. The simple thing is you could say fear, but what is the fear? That is the fear. It's to say, "I'm going to walk my own path now and I'm going to be who I want to be, and I'm going to discover who I was before the world told me who to be, and by doing so, I run the risk that I'm not going to be accepted anymore." That's terrifying.

Lenny (01:12:44):
Because it's so terrifying, I imagine that's why the suffering is so important to really feel that because, otherwise, why would you go down that path? It feels very hard.

Andy Johns (01:12:57):
Yeah, and that gets to my point earlier around I'm not entirely convinced that this is an act of free will on my part. There have been moments of me intervening and acting with free will, but I believe that there are also undercurrents that would fall into the realm of superstition for a lot of folks that this is the path that was laid out in front of me even before I was born.

Lenny (01:13:29):
Along those same lines, you wrote in one of your writings that at the end of the day, you're on your own to find what ends up alleviating your psychological suffering. Can you speak to that?

Andy Johns (01:13:41):
Yeah. That really ties in with this point of the uniqueness of people. You have to find what works for you. For some people, it's going to be the ice bath thing. For others it's not. Last year, a quick anecdote, I spent a month working at an animal sanctuary in northern Thailand for abused animals and neglected animals. This place is amazing. They take in anything and they say, "We'll find a way," and that's what they do. So they have hundreds and hundreds of animals, including a large herd of elephants, which is pretty amazing. 

(01:14:24):
There was a worker there who I met, and just by the expression on his face, I could tell that this was a liberated man. This was somebody who had figured out something that was contributing to his deep sense of peace. So I went to talk with him. I said, "Hey, something tells me that you figured out the secret to life and I'd like to chat." So we talked, and it turned out that half the time he was a farmer, he had a small little farm, an acre up on a hill in the mountains, and he'd work at his farm half the time and the other half he would then go and work at the animal sanctuary, and he was a practicing Buddhist. 

(01:15:15):
One of the things he said to me really stood out. He used a simple analogy. He said, "Everyone's trying to make it to Bangkok. The problem is they're getting to Bangkok by following somebody else's road. The whole point is to find your own path to Bangkok." He was making that same point or a similar point of you've got to find your own way. That is the message. For me, I take that as maybe the most fundamental message in looking back at the story of the original Buddha himself was, sure, the teachings, the traditions, everything that's formed around his teachings has power and merit to it, but I look at what he did. He was born as a prince into a royal family. Something wasn't right, and he was seeking the truth behind this anguish and this unfulfillment, and there was something inside of him that said, "I must seek the answer because growing up in this sheltered life as a prince, this can't be the answer." 

(01:16:31):
So he left it all behind, including his wife and child, and then he lived as an aesthetic for years, nearly dying close to starvation. He did that for years. Then eventually he realized, "Well, that's not the answer either." Then he famously made his way to the Bodhi tree and sat under it and meditated for 40, 41 days. I can't recall what it was, a long time. Then he had his enlightenment, and out of that came one of the teachings, which is known as the middle way. It's not about being a prince, it's not about being poor. There's something in between. He found that was his path to Bangkok. You could walk that path and maybe it'll teach you something or it'll lead you nowhere because it's not your own path. I think that's the point.

Lenny (01:17:32):
Andy, what a beautiful way to wrap up our conversation. Before we do, is there anything else you want to share that you want to leave listeners with? Then also, I'm just curious how you're doing these days.

Andy Johns (01:17:44):
Sure, sure. Well, let me answer the first one, a message to leave to folks. I would imagine that there's a lot of high performers, successful folks out there. Some of you, you may feel like you're on the verge of answering a call towards a new chapter in life or towards finding a way out of whatever situation you're in that you don't want to be in anymore. The thing I guess I would say to you is that having undergone some change myself, all I can promise you is that it's going to be in some ways the best thing that's ever happened to you, but also the worst thing that's ever happened to you, but those are the experiences that define a life. 

(01:18:36):
If you feel that call inside of you to seek a new way of living, just know that you're not the only one out there doing it. There are others out there such as myself and that I can always be reached. So I wish you a happy journey and just know that things are going to be okay. Now, the second question, what am I up to nowadays? Is that-

Lenny (01:19:03):
How are you doing? How are you doing on this journey?

Andy Johns (01:19:06):
I'm good. I still have my ups and downs. I've arrived at an interesting part in my journey where it's something that I'm practicing now and I still don't quite have the hang of it. I'll use one more metaphor. I think the way that I approached the first part of my life was as if life was a big mountain to be climbed, where you're trying to head up Everest under this assumption that once you get to the top, you're going to have this bliss that will persist or that will make you feel that you had a life well-lived, and that that was the answer, but what I experienced was that once I got to the top of one mountain, then I had to find the top of another and another and another. Although you see and do some amazing things along the way, at some point it's too exhausting. At some point, you may really get yourself into trouble and you might not survive. 

(01:20:13):
The vast majority of people who die on Mount Everest actually die on the way down, not on the way up. You don't save anything for the return home, I think is the point. Instead of pursuing my life now as a mountain to be climbed in the hopes that reaching the top will make me feel good again, I'm instead trying to float down river. So for example, if you go whitewater rafting, they'll give you a little safety crash course at the beginning. They'll say, "Here's how you paddle. Put your vest on." One of the things they'll ask you is, what do I do if I fall overboard, especially if I fall overboard into the rapids or the cold water? This is maybe the most important thing they teach because commonly what happens if you're in sizable enough rapids and you fall overboard, the tendency is to freak out and to fight the current. When people freak out in the water, especially when the water's choppy, that's when they get in trouble. 

(01:21:20):
The thing they teach you to do is instead you go into mummy mode, right? You lay back, you cross your arms across your chest, and you stick your feet out like you're a mummy, and you do the opposite of fighting the current. You allow the current to take you where it's trying to take you. For me, I actually find that I believe that that's a more fitting metaphor for life. It's possible that there's something amazing for us downstream so long as we're willing to surrender and just let go, to turn off the intellectual mind a bit, to quit trying to plan as if you can predict the future, to quit thinking about all the edge cases and trying to optimize our life, which I think is a bunch of bullshit. It's possible that if you just relax and you instead pay attention to the signals around you, you feel where the current is trying to take you, maybe towards a potential life partner, maybe away from an oppressive work environment, maybe towards a place to live that is more calm and peaceful, whatever it may be. 

(01:22:33):
If you really tune in with yourself and pay attention to that current and you relax into it, you'll arrive at a destination that you were meant for. In a sense, that's what I did that has brought me to this conversation today. Instead of talking about investing in companies and what have you, I'm instead trying to connect with people on an entirely different level and help them make their own way downstream, so to speak. 

(01:23:11):
So for me nowadays, that's how I'm living at the moment. I'm actually in Vietnam. Just got here about 10 days ago because it seemed like the current of life was taking me here right now. It's likely that it's just the next lily pad towards wherever else I'm heading to, but I guess I'm in the mindset now where I'm willing to just surrender and see how it unfolds.

Lenny (01:23:35):
The metaphor for that is they lost your luggage on the way to Vietnam, and we had to push back this recording a week.

Andy Johns (01:23:41):
Yeah, that's right, that's right. My luggage was half a world away from me, and so when that happened, what could I do? I just said, "Okay. Well, I have shorts and a shirt on me that I can wear for the next three or four days," and that's what I did.

Lenny (01:24:00):
Amazing. Andy, I think this might end up being one of the most meaningful episodes of the podcast. I think it's going to end up being a Trojan horse for people are coming here for advice on optimizing their product and growth, and they'll opt up rethinking their whole life, hopefully in a good way, maybe cause some suffering, maybe help people through suffering. Thank you, Andy, so much for being here. Two final questions. You said people could reach out if they're going down this path and maybe need some help or advice. So what's the best way for people to reach out, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Johns (01:24:31):
Sure, a couple ways. You can find me on Twitter, my username is Clues Dot Life, so C-L-U-E-S-D-O-T-L-I-F-E. You can also find me on LinkedIn, search for Andrew Johns, you'll find me on there. You can check out my website Clues.Life. It's a basic MVP, but it's an art project that's in process. So those are a couple of ways that you can reach out. In terms of ways you can help, you can't always tell who you're helping. When I sit behind my laptop and I write and I send my messages out into the world, other than getting some thumbs up here and there, you don't always know what impact you're having. 

(01:25:22):
Sometimes it's good to hear because, again, for me, this is part of me rewriting that internal narrative where I'm trying to do more work for the benefit of others as opposed to what it does for my bank account. So if part of this message has been beneficial to you, it would certainly put wind in my sails to hear that. So that would be one way to help.

Lenny (01:25:50):
What a great answer. So let's blow up the YouTube comments and send you some DMs and LinkedIn messages if people find this valuable. Andy, thank you again so much for being here.

Andy Johns (01:26:02):
Lenny, I appreciate it, man. Thank you.

# The power of strategic narrative | Andy Raskin

## Transcript

Andy Raskin (00:00:00):
The way I learned how to pitch in business school, and I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatments. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. Every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, and I call this shift the shift from the old game to a new game. The archetypal example of this, I think in the business world, is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over and there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, new rules. That's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:00:54):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Andy Raskin. Andy helps CEOs and company leaders align their teams around something he calls a strategic narrative, which as you'll learn all about in this episode, is essentially a simple story that helps people understand why they need your product. And with that helps you align your sales, marketing, and product teams along with your fundraising and even your hiring efforts.

Lenny (00:01:25):
Andy has worked closely with some of the most successful founders and companies out there, including companies like Gong, Dropbox, Uber, Salesforce, Square, IBM, and many others. In our conversation, Andy explains why most people are pitching their product completely wrong, why focusing on the problem you're solving for people is no longer an effective pitch and how the strategic narrative helps you frame your solution in a much more effective way. Andy also shares a ton of examples of the framework in action, why focusing on categories and category creation is so limiting, signs your narrative needs to work and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Andy Raskin after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:07):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing a roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

Lenny (00:02:45):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

Lenny (00:04:16):
Andy, welcome to the podcast.

Andy Raskin (00:04:18):
Oh, thanks Lenny. So great to talk with you.

Lenny (00:04:21):
You are quite known as someone that helps CEOs optimize their pitch, their story, their strategy, which we're going to get deep into. But before we do that, can you just give us a little glimpse into how you found your way into this line of work?

Andy Raskin (00:04:35):
I started as a coder. I was a computer science major, undergrad, a friend and I had an idea for an app. So this was like during the dot com years. So Windows app, and we coded a little prototype and we started, we put it out there, we started getting some users and we thought, "Oh, okay, maybe we can get some investments." So of the two of us, I spoke English fluently. So we decided, okay, I'll write the investor pitch. So I wrote the pitch, we sent it out and the reaction was really bad. One VC wrote back and said, "Listen, I rate every plan I get on a scale of 1 to 10, and yours is a 1," and the next to the one he wrote in parentheses, "Worst," in case we thought maybe that was the top of his rating scale.

Lenny (00:05:20):
Brutal.

Andy Raskin (00:05:22):
Yeah, brutal. But then lower down, so this was back when they would like you'd print, send the hard copy of the plan and they might mail it back with comments written in. And he had written in, "Not a compelling story." A few weeks later, I'm walking by this Barnes & Noble and there's a sign in the window that says, "For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story," okay, that's me. And there's an arrow that points to these books and they turned out to be screenwriting books. I didn't know anything about this, so I started reading these books and it strikes me a movie is a pitch. What is Star Wars a pitch for? It's a pitch for be good, care about people, trust The Force in their terms. But I don't have couple hours. I'm pitching a business. It's very different. I'm not writing a three X screenplay.

Andy Raskin (00:06:11):
So what applies, what doesn't apply? I mean these are questions I think I'm still asking, but I did my best to take some of the learnings of how the movie was structured. It was very different from how my pitch was structured and kind of restructure it. And we did that and we sent the pitch out and we start getting more interest. It was really clear. And then we had a term sheet I think a few months later and I'm like, "What is this story thing?" That we didn't change the product, it was basically the same business just sort of how we talked about it. That was really interesting to me.

Andy Raskin (00:06:49):
I mean, over the next 10, 15 years, I thought about, "Hey, maybe I could do consulting with this." CEOs who heard about this were asking me about it. But I still was like, "No. No CEO's going to budget a line item for the story. That's not a thing." So I just didn't do it for a really long time until eventually I was proven wrong about that.

Lenny (00:07:13):
And how many years ago was this at this point?

Andy Raskin (00:07:15):
So this was dot com. This was like '98 when I was pitching that company.

Lenny (00:07:20):
Amazing. I think there's a couple interesting tidbits about this. One is that interesting opportunities arise when you're doing something you're excited about. So you had the startup, it didn't work out, but you had a problem that you solved for yourself and that led to another, a bigger opportunity for your career.

Andy Raskin (00:07:34):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:07:35):
So that's interesting. And then also just some of the best opportunities arise from solving your own problem, not planning to start something with it, but just like, "I have a problem." Turns out [inaudible 00:07:44]-

Andy Raskin (00:07:44):
Yeah, I think that's same with you. Right, Lenny? You started writing about stuff and boom, that became the thing.

Lenny (00:07:49):
Absolutely. It was not quite boom, but eventually it became boom.

Andy Raskin (00:07:53):
Feels like boom from outside.

Lenny (00:07:55):
Yeah, that's how it goes. It always overnight for everyone else that isn't here.

Andy Raskin (00:08:01):
Right, exactly.

Lenny (00:08:03):
Yeah. Okay, so let's get into it. So you help CEOs at this point come up with what you call a strategic narrative and you help them not only come up with this strategic narrative, but you help their teams align around this strategic narrative. So let's just start with what is a strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:08:19):
Yeah, you'd think, I've been doing this for 10 years, I'd have a very snappy definition of it there, and I don't know if I'm really happy with ... like I've ever found one that totally gets at it yet. The one thing I say is it's this one story that the CEO uses to drive success in marketing, sales, but also product. That it becomes like a north star, strategic north star for product roadmap, for fundraising, for recruiting, really everything.

Andy Raskin (00:08:54):
What I think is really interesting as a kind of qualifier is that this story has a certain structure. Like I said, when I found those screenwriting books, I sort of shifted the structure. And the traditional structure, the way I learned how to pitch in business school, I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatment.

Andy Raskin (00:09:24):
Not to say it's not better, but just this is the structure of it, and it kind of sets you up for bragging. Let me tell you why it's so great. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. In the movies, every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, in the character's world. And I call this shift the shift from the old game to the new game. And the archetypal example of this, I think in the business world is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over," meaning software in the sense that we're going to own it and maintain it, "And there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, like the new rules, everything has changed and that's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:10:34):
I think the Salesforce example is an awesome example of your approach. If they were thinking about it in the old way, what would Salesforce have done? How would they have pitched it if not for, "Everyone's moving to the cloud, your dumb for using desktop software,"?

Andy Raskin (00:10:48):
Well, I think they would've just come out and said like, "Oh hey ..." I mean CRM by the way, was already a category. I mean, already Siebel was the huge giant of that space. There were already even companies doing it online, doing it through the web. And so they would've come and said, "Oh, we're easier to install, faster to get up and running than Siebel," or, "We have this much functionality compared to," I think it was, was it NetSuite? Or, I don't know. It was some early Salesforce-like thing that was out there. They would've done these sort of comparison things.

Andy Raskin (00:11:25):
And Benioff, I mean he is a pretty proud guy. I think he did still say like, "Hey, we're the number one CRM," but wasn't what they led with. They led with this story about this fundamental paradigm shift and, are you in or are you not in? And what they did was instead of just saying, "Hey, we're better than," they said, "Hey, all those others, those Siebel's, they're part of that old game. You want to play that software game? Be my guest, go buy Siebel," and of course we know how it played out.

Lenny (00:12:02):
So the crux of the approach is instead of, "Problem, solution, you should go do this," it's, "The world is changing, here's where it's going and we're going to help you get there." I want go in a little more depth of the framework. But before that, what are some other examples to give people a sense of like, oh, I see, I understand what this might be.

Andy Raskin (00:12:19):
Yeah, so another great example and no coincidence, so is Zuora. So Zuora is the company I wrote about in this post called The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen, the CEO of Zuora, Tien Tzuo, was employee number 11 at Salesforce. So he learns this from Benioff. And he's pitching, "Hey, in the old world, businesses operated on transactions. You sold things to people outright. In this new world," he calls it the subscription economy, where people want the benefits of those things without necessarily having to pay for them. And of course gives all these examples of all the winners in this, look at all the winning companies. They're all basically going to this new model.

Andy Raskin (00:13:05):
And so he's pitching someone like Ford and you can imagine they're going to Ford and pitching a subscription for car service, which is quite different from just a lease. And they're starting out with this. This is the big shift. Another one, team I worked with early on, and I think they'd agree their story came out of this work was Gong. So Gong everyone probably knows by now, they take the video recordings of all your sales calls and they stick AI onto it and come out with all these insights. And that story is, hey, goodbye opinions. Used to be a world where sales is run on opinions. Hello reality, that now all the winners are adopting this new mindset where we really have to see what's really going on.

Lenny (00:13:56):
In the Gong example, let's say, what would they have done if they were going, "Here's the problem, here's the solution, here's what we're going to do for you,"?

Andy Raskin (00:14:03):
Yeah, I mean that's kind of what they were doing when they started out. And I'm not saying that didn't work totally. I mean already by the time they started doing this, they were starting to become a big company. I remember Bendov said to me, "Listen, Andy," they were around series B, I think this is around 2018. It's like, "We're going to be a huge company. The question is how huge. And I think that this narrative along the lines of Zuora or Salesforce, if we get this right, this is going to be a multiplier on our growth."

Andy Raskin (00:14:38):
So I don't remember exactly the pitch beforehand, but it was very much like, "Hey, we're going to record your calls. We're going to get insights from them. They're better than the insights you could get from Salesforce." There wasn't this kind of unifying kind of movement ideology that put it all in context. And what was really interesting was one thing, I don't think they'd be upset if I shared, and maybe it's known. Initially, they were seen as a tool for sales operations, for someone who's going to record the calls and what this narrative did for them. And I think it was already starting to happen, but what it really coalesced was this is a tool for sales leadership.

Lenny (00:15:23):
You talked about Zuora in the post you wrote, and I imagine many people listening are like, "Oh, shit. This is the guy that wrote that post that everyone's always sharing with me about how to make a deck." And I wanted to ask, how impactful was that one piece of writing for you in your career, just like as a tangent?

Andy Raskin (00:15:39):
I had written some other posts on Medium in particular. Medium has changed quite a bit, but back then I found that I could write stuff there and get really a lot of people who were interested in what I was interested would sort of come in and create some noise about it. So I was already doing this kind of work for a couple of years, but that post immediately got something like 2 million views around the world and I started getting inquiries from teams all over the world.

Andy Raskin (00:16:12):
And it was I think what really allowed me to say no, okay, I could do this work. That CEO's would budget a line item for this. Because I think if you really understand that post, it's not really about a sales deck, it's really about this story that Tien, the CEO is telling everywhere and that is showing up in the sales deck and structuring it that way.

Lenny (00:16:40):
I think it's just another example that comes up a bunch on this podcast is just the power of writing and the power of content. Yeah, and you're shaking your head.

Andy Raskin (00:16:48):
Totally. I mean, I had a little mini career as a journalist, as a freelance writer and I really loved that. I actually, I took a class in New York called How to Write a Magazine Article, because I was sort of mid-career, I was curious. And the class wound up being more about how to sell a magazine article. And I found I really loved that, pitching articles, but one thing that was always a downer for me was there's always this editor sort of deciding what's going to be out there.

Andy Raskin (00:17:23):
And when you work with a great editor, it's great, they make yourself better and they're priceless. But still there's this intermediary. What started to happen, I think around when I started writing around 2013, '14, you start to see these platforms, like Medium, even LinkedIn where you can just write and have this audience and I think no way I could do this, the work I do if that development hadn't happened first.

Lenny (00:17:53):
I'm taking us off track, but I want to go a little deeper with this. I find that there's kind of two paths to writing online. One is your path where you write one piece that just blows up like crazy. The other path is more my path where I just write consistently for a long time, and both work and most people try to go your path and they never succeed. It's really hard to make something gets 2 million views, but you can go that path.

Andy Raskin (00:18:14):
This is like you said earlier, hey, it seems like boom, but really it didn't. So that was probably the 30th or 40th piece and they were gradually getting more and more traction. There was one I wrote before that about, it's kind of dissecting Elon Musk's pitch for the Powerwall, the battery that they sell. And that one got maybe few hundred thousand views and also was a big jump. And then the next one got some poultry number. So what I find is like, yeah, there's this a while where you're writing and it feels like you're talking to nobody and then gradually it grows and you'll have these peaks, but then over time is where the magic is.

Lenny (00:19:03):
Okay, I'm really glad you pointed that out, that it rarely is just you write one thing and it's boom.

Andy Raskin (00:19:08):
I'll also say, sorry, because I worked in a magazine, I haven't done a newsletter because that idea of having a deadline all the time and constantly having to, we used to call the magazine Feed the Beast, I feel so free not to have that. So for now at least I haven't done that.

Lenny (00:19:27):
I know that well, so let me take us back on track and let's talk about just the high level framework here. So you talked about, it starts with this idea of tell people worlds changing, join this movement. What's the simple way to think about this, the pieces of this strategic narrative framework?

Andy Raskin (00:19:42):
A lot of times people will contact me, say, "Hey, I tried it, didn't work." Well, one very common thing, at least earlier was they would basically just take the Zuora deck, they'd get ahold of it and just put their logo on it. And so that's not going to work. One thing is we're not just saying, "Hey, the world is changing." And then sometimes I'll see, "The world is changing," and there'll be, "Used to be," and there's a long list of things and then, "Now it is," a long list of bullet points.

Andy Raskin (00:20:11):
What's really, I think key is naming it, naming that old game. The examples you saw, software, cloud, transactions, subscription opinions, reality. This very, very concise naming is really key. And it's hard because in making it compact you're losing completeness. So you can imagine you're in a meeting, someone says like, "Hey, how about we do transactions to subscriptions?" And someone says, "Well I don't know, there's a lot of things I don't really subscribe to. Subscription economy, really?" So we're always kind of overstating it in a way, but it's not a problem. I don't think people say like, "Oh that's wrong, subscription economy, because I still go to the grocery store and buy things." So anyway, that's the first piece.

Andy Raskin (00:20:59):
The second piece is what I call naming the stakes. And there's a few ways to do this, but one that's really great if we can do it is to name the winners to show that winners are already playing this new game. So for instance with Zuora they're saying, "Hey, look, look at all the new winners," this is like 2015 so, "Airbnb, Box," all these companies, they're already doing this subscription thing.

Andy Raskin (00:21:28):
And by the way, overall they show this scary stat about the longevity of Fortune 500 companies. It's getting smaller, and so it's a little disingenuous, but basically they make this case that, "Hey, companies are dying, the ones that are winning are doing this." And so to the extent we want to make this life and death just like a movie. This is again, I'll make the parallel to Star Wars. So Luke, he spends the first 15 minutes of the movie belly aching. He wants to be a pilot, he wants to go out and have adventures in space. So Obiwan comes, he says, "Hey, we got this mission, this princess we got to go," and all this stuff, "Let's go. I'll teach you to be a pilot. We'll go have adventures in space." What does Luke say? He says, "Ooh, you know what, I can't really get involved. They got to go home. It's late." Who does this sound like? The reluctant buyer.

Andy Raskin (00:22:27):
So yeah, "I want to be innovative and all this. Ooh, you know what? I don't have budget this quarter." So how does George Lucas change Luke's mind? He basically kills the aunt and uncle, sorry, spoilers, it's been 40 years though. If you haven't seen it, you're probably not going to see it. Kills the aunt and uncle. Now it's pretty clear they're coming for Luke. Now the stakes are life and death. Probably he's going to be dead. But there is this other path that Obiwan holds out for him.

Andy Raskin (00:22:55):
And whenever I work with teams and I talk about this, so they're like, "Okay, I guess we got to then for kill the prospect's aunt and uncle," and basically yes, I mean figuratively. We got to show them that the future is not going to just be sort of okay. People talk about making it emotional and I've always wondered, what does that mean? Literally, what is the definition? This is for me the definition, is that the prospect doesn't see the future as sort of okay. They see it as split between a very negative outcome and a potentially very positive outcome.

Andy Raskin (00:23:29):
The third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game. I used to call it the promised land message, but I've changed it to this because I've found that it's sort of a little more fruitful. This subscription economy, transactions, it can get a little highfalutin and sort of big, but on the website when we just have to boil it down to a couple of words that's going to be clear right away, what can we say? And I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers. Very simple. It just sort of flows from it. Airbnb for a while had this one, live anywhere. If you think about-

Lenny (00:24:21):
Belong anywhere.

Andy Raskin (00:24:23):
Well actually it was-

Lenny (00:24:24):
Oh, live like a human.

Andy Raskin (00:24:25):
So you're right, it was, "Belong anywhere," and then it switched to, "Live there." I may have the chronology wrong, but it was the two of those things. You know better than I do. But either one, I mean think they're saying very similar things. Hey, there's this new world where you don't have to live in hotels, you can stay in people's houses. What's the object of that game is to belong anywhere, but live there. And I love it when it works that way where it's almost like an asymptotically unachievable thing. You are never literally going to live there. And if you think about it, this buyer mission statement, this rallying cry, I think of it really as the mission of the company. I mean, what is the mission of Airbnb other than to help people live there if they're going to be customer focused and all that?

Andy Raskin (00:25:17):
The fourth piece is, okay, well this object of the game, winning this game, it better be hard because if it's not, why would we even exist? Just with the movie, if Luke can just go destroy the Death Star then no movie. So there's got to be sort of obstacles in the way, things that are preventing them from. So saying, "Okay, you want to turn customers into subscribers." So whereas Zuora, where they go next is to say, "Okay, well how are you going to measure lifetime value?" Because now you have this always on thing. "How are you going to measure preferences and how they're changing over?" All these new kind of challenges that didn't exist before. And then these are like the monsters in Lord of the Rings or the Empire in Star Wars, these are the obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:26:11):
I think about them because they sound like problems. This is what people would normally say, "Oh, these are the problems we solve." But by setting up this story thing first we've repackaged them as obstacles to a new goal state that we've already positioned as life and death. So they take on this much more emotional meaning. We understand why they matter. And then of course the last piece is now talking about, well, how are we going to overcome these obstacles? Narrative people, in the movie business they call these the magic gifts that the main character gets to go help them win. What are the ways? Now we can talk about that and success stories and all the rest of the stuff.

Lenny (00:26:58):
There's some obvious parallels to the hero's journey here. I imagine that it was a source of inspiration, and the Star Wars I think is the epitome of that journey. Can you talk about just how related those two are, how you think about that?

Andy Raskin (00:27:09):
Yeah, I mean so hero's journey is this book that comes from, I think it's Hero of A Thousand Faces is a book by Joseph Campbell, a sociologist. He looks at myths over different cultures and different times and he finds this kind of common structure that he calls the hero's journey. I mean it's some controversy about that, about his book. Is it a very male oriented sort of take on things and a bunch of things.

Andy Raskin (00:27:38):
But even that aside, I found when I would talk about hero's journey and stuff, it's just like, it didn't really tell me what to do. Yeah, okay, yeah I got to do this pitch. So in the hero's journey there's like refusal of the call. That's actually that thing where Luke says he doesn't want to go and where the buyer says, "Hey, I don't have budget." But I don't know, it was just too theoretical for me to really ... when I use it, people seem to sort of glass over. So I just don't really talk about that at all. But yeah, I mean that's behind a lot of this stuff for sure.

Lenny (00:28:17):
Yeah, that makes sense because I think if people hear about that all the time when they're like, become a better storyteller, tell your story in this hero's journey, and it's like, "I don't know what I'm doing."

Andy Raskin (00:28:25):
Also, I would say there's storytelling as a skill kind of thing, which is a great thing. Learn how to tell stories better, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not really interested in that in my work, what I'm interested in is the one story and the structure of that one story. And this one story, it doesn't really have ... like, the world is moved from transactions to subscriptions. There's not a main character in that story who's like having a problem and getting saved. It's almost as if what's happening is we're turning the person we talk to into the main character. By spelling out the shift, we're changing their world and we're saying, "Hey, you got to change and you want to come with us."

Lenny (00:29:13):
It's almost like you're putting them into the hero's journey, like, "Here's how you win."

Andy Raskin (00:29:16):
Exactly. I love that.

Lenny (00:29:18):
Let me just try to summarize what you shared, this five step framework. So you start with here's a new movement that's happening and you want to name it, you want to name the stakes and there's winners and losers and here's already happening and it's really important. Then you want to name the object of the new game, like turning customers into subscribers. Then show the obstacles, here's why it's challenging, and then talk about how you're going to overcome these obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:29:41):
And by the way, the naming of the object of the new game, I find it often is really nice to do it as a question. So we hey, there's this shift from transactions to subscriptions and look, everyone's doing it. So we asked a simple question, what would it take to turn every customer into a subscriber? And this way we're kind of bringing the person we're pitching to almost like they're coming along with us as a co, I don't know, adventurer in crafting this story.

Lenny (00:30:17):
I love that. This episode is brought to you by Eco. Last month Eco users earned an average of $84 in cash back rewards. How? With Eco the future of personal finance. Eco is the update to a misaligned financial system providing an app that works just like your bank but removes almost all of the middlemen, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time automatically.

Lenny (00:30:40):
What if you earn rewards for paying your rent or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online or even earn rewards for saving each month? And then imagine if you got rewarded again just for getting rewarded. With Eco, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cash back plus Eco's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are Eco points, the world's first open reward system. You earn them whenever you do almost anything in the eco app. Eco is working to make these points the most rewarding points ever so it pays to be early.

Lenny (00:31:13):

Maybe just to reinforce this even more, what if we go through the five steps and just with one company as an example and just talk about what each of those were for them?

Andy Raskin (00:31:41):
Okay, great. So there's a company called 360Learning. So this company, I don't know if folks know, but this company is raised over $200 million. They're in the space of corporate training software. So big companies, they have to train their people on all kinds of stuff. So you want to go through that one?

Lenny (00:32:01):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Andy Raskin (00:32:03):
Okay, great. By the way, Nick Hernandez is the CEO and Nick's been on my podcast, so he's talked about this. So they for a long time were pitching themselves as collaborative learning. So they have features that let people sort of collaborate on courses and all kinds of stuff. And Nick is often pitching CEOs, of course his team is as well. And he told me that it was sort of falling a little bit flat. People, collaborative learning, whatever. How are you different from this learning platform, this learning platform?

Andy Raskin (00:32:42):
And so when we worked together this collaborative learning, it's almost like a category name or a descriptor or something. They were so embedded that I decided, I don't even want to take it out, but can we define it in terms of a story? So the story they came to was, hey, used to be that companies train their people through basically a mindset of top-down learning. There's going to be some learning guru at the company, they're going to get all the courses, they're going to put it all together and sort of send out this training material to everybody.

Andy Raskin (00:33:23):
What's happening now is winning companies are approaching this differently. They're adopting this approach we might call upskill from within, which is if you look at Google, there's this page where I think you can go, it's a public. You can connect with Google's AI experts. They literally turn their internal experts into champions that are educating, not even just the company but even external people. They've created this culture of our own people are going to be the educators. So that's the shift from top down to this upskill from within. And of course I just even started to do the second piece which was like, hey, look at the big companies who are doing this.

Andy Raskin (00:34:10):
And then I think they showed, "Hey, you're not doing this. Look, training is becoming very expensive. People don't care. So this is the downside. So we're creating these sort of stake ..." And also I think he has something about how training now, like companies, if you don't adapt, if you can't get these skills to your people, if you're a car company and you can't get these skills around electric cars, you're dead.

Andy Raskin (00:34:35):
Nick was in France and he saw this poster, a recruiting poster from McDonald's and it said, "Hey, if you work at McDonald's you're going to learn from everybody else on your team." And it was like, wow, there it is. So there's another example we used as a kind of winner example. And so then the question became, I can't remember exactly, it was something like, how do you upskill from within? What would it take for you to turn your experts into champions of learning in the company and turn them into stars, and all this?

Andy Raskin (00:35:06):
And then I'm going to forget here what all the obstacles were. But I think it was things like, well, how are you going to make it possible for anybody to create a course? People who might have expertise in electric engines but don't know how to create a course, how are you going to make sure that there's still the learning department, they're going to keep control and can ... all this. You can imagine all the different kind of questions. And then of course now 360Learning starts talking about all that stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:35:36):
What Nick has told me, I'm actually going to be on a webinar with Nick where someone asked me, "Could you bring in a CEO who could talk about this stuff? Not just you B blabbing on about strategic narrative." And so Nick is going to join it. And we had a dress rehearsal the other day and he was telling me it's just like when he starts with this now he doesn't even get the question anymore of well how are you different from this other learning platform? Which used to always be the thing. It's just a much more seamless, okay, yeah, talk to our learning people, get this going. So it's just sounds like it's been really effective for them.

Lenny (00:36:13):
That's actually was what I was going to ask next is what kind of impact have you seen with someone shifting their pitch story from this doc? What was the arrogant doctor approach to the strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:36:23):
Yeah, I mean it's always this kind of thing I hear. I mean, of course it's very difficult to measure this. I mean, what was the value of the strategic narrative for Gong and its growth? Was it 3X versus 1X, 2X? Or I don't, who knows, right? But the things I hear from CEOs, a few things. One is that when they're pitching, they're not pitching features out of context, they're pitching now a movement which is a lot better place to be, I think. In a way you're not pitching product. Product is like a prop for making the story come true. Very important prop, but there's this higher level overlay that becomes the focus of the conversation, at first, and of course we're going to get into product and that helps sell. Once we have this story then everything in marketing can be all about this story.

Andy Raskin (00:37:21):
With Zuora, if you look at their website, well when they first started doing this, maybe 80% of the content is not, "Hey, let me tell you about how Zuora is so great," or, "Here's our new release," or whatever. It's, "Here's how music companies are embracing subscriptions. Here's how luxury goods companies are embracing subscriptions." It's all these kind of almost trend pieces that become unlimited fodder. And again, you're not touting your ... it's less salesy, right?

Andy Raskin (00:37:51):
Another thing I just hear always, I just interviewed a CEO this morning for my podcast and this is the first thing he actually said was, "It becomes the strategic north star for the product." So what he was telling me, and this was actually a little unusual, I asked him, "Why did you come to me at first?" And of course I'd asked him that before, but he said something this time that was a little different from what I'd heard before. He said, "We are constantly getting feature requests through sales, through customer success. And we had sort of no way, bar to decide well what do we take on, what don't we take on? And this clearly has become our bar."

Andy Raskin (00:38:38):
If you think about it for 360Learning, does it help us upskill from within? It's in. Does it not? Or it's prioritized. Does it not? Less prioritized. Amit Bendov told me this directly, he said we exactly the same thing. He said, "We get a lot of requests for features and a lot of them are basically about opinions, some way to record opinions."

Lenny (00:39:04):
And this is Gong.

Andy Raskin (00:39:04):
"We're not going to do those." In Gong, yeah. "We're not going to do those."

Lenny (00:39:08):
Are there any companies out there that maybe aren't clients that you see as like, wow, these guys are nailing it and they're doing a great job of this strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:39:15):
Well, one that really comes to mind is, I mean it's been out there for a while, but Drift. Drift comes out with essentially like a chatbot for your website, which might be the 30th chatbot for your website. And they don't say, "Hey, here's why our chatbot is the best one." They start from a completely different place, which is, "Hey, used to be people would sort of wait around for you to get back to them. It was a world of later. They called it the world of forms. You put up a web form and you expect someone's going to fill it out and maybe wait a few days while you take your sweet time deciding if you're going to get back to them."

Andy Raskin (00:39:58):
And David Cancel and David Gerhardt started from right the beginning saying, "Now we're in a world of now, where buyers are ..." I think they showed this woman, I remember it was this woman sleeping with her phone. That's your prospect. They're always on and they're going to expect you to be engaging with them right away. And they called this conversational marketing, and they really went with that and created I think a whole movement and they broke away from all of the other chatbots.

Lenny (00:40:35):
Awesome example. So earlier you threw out this word category, and I've noticed you haven't talked about category and category creation too much, and I think that you're kind of not a fan of this idea of creating a category and focusing on category. I'd love to hear your perspective on how that all relates to the stuff you recommend.

Andy Raskin (00:40:55):
Lenny, are you trying to get me in trouble? Like that guy who guy on your podcast who attacked jobs to be done?

Lenny (00:41:02):
Apparently, let's do it. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into.

Andy Raskin (00:41:06):
I would soften it a little bit and not just ... because I don't want the ire of the category design folks, but I really would soften and say, I wouldn't say I'm not a fan of creating category. Look, I think if you look at Play Bigger, which has become The Bible of that category creation thing, if you look behind that going to, what do they say the category is? They say it's a narrative. It's a story about how the world was to how it is. And so what I find though is that when people think about category creation, they tend to just focus on, okay, well, what is this category name going to be that we got? What are these three words or two words, whatever, that are going to magically make us seem like we're totally different from everybody else?

Andy Raskin (00:41:52):
And A, I think that's not really possible. These three words aren't going to do it. Take Gong, I mean already other companies were using this term revenue intelligence. With Gong, it suddenly becomes a thing because I think they have this opinions-to-reality story behind it. At one point, again, I asked Amit, he said, "Yeah," because I remember he really struggled, "What should we call it? What should we call it?"

Andy Raskin (00:42:20):
He came up with that one. But then when I asked him later, he is like, "Yeah, you know what? In hindsight we probably could have called it strawberry intelligence. It didn't matter. It was really the story that sort of mattered." I think he was exaggerating a little bit. And I think the category people would actually agree with this, I think they would agree with, hey, these three words are, it's sort of a shorthand for this movement of old game narrative.

Andy Raskin (00:42:48):
But I guess I feel like still by calling it category and category name, we're just focusing on those three words so much. And what happens often is CEOs will, they'll kind of come up with this little category, like what happened with Nick at the 360Learning with collaborative learning. We have this name, but we don't know how to tell the story around it. So my feeling is like, well, let's focus on the story. So that's why I talk about strategic narrative and movement creation versus category creation. If someone decides that your movement is a category, great. Bonus.

Lenny (00:43:32):
I see. So essentially your approach is category can play a part of this, but there's a bigger question you have of what's the story, what's the movement, what are the obstacles and categories and element of that potentially?

Andy Raskin (00:43:45):
I mean, I almost see them as orthogonal, like with HubSpot. HubSpot had this narrative around inbound. It used to be just outbound stuff, now we're going to have inbound. And that wasn't really a category. Back then they were probably known as marketing automation. Now they're probably known as CRM because they've broadened. But this movement is the thing that's sort of the constant and in some ways orthogonal to whatever category they're in.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Is the strategic narrative framework right for essentially any company or is there a sweet spot? And I've noticed most of the companies you've been talking about are B2B SaaS. So I don't know, maybe if there's a spectrum of perfect fit for strategic narrative framework and then not a fit at all. What's along that spectrum?

Andy Raskin (00:44:33):
Yeah, well you can see, I mean it takes a little time to tell this story and you were kind of framing it a little bit and we're telling it in lots of different channels. So I think it does really play well in this enterprise sales context because also we have a group buyer there. So it's not just one person who's doing some research. This whole group has to have a uniting story. So I think you're right that in noticing that the companies that this tends to resonate with tend to be B2B, enterprise sales, technology I think because often the product is very complicated. That arrogant doctor stuff comes from an age when the things people were selling were products on shelves that didn't change much, cans of soup at the supermarket or a car in a dealership. Even software back then, shrink-wrapped in a box, doesn't change.

Andy Raskin (00:45:44):
B2B software, this stuff is changing by the minute. And does it even make sense to make a claim to say, "Oh, we have these features and they have those features, therefore we're better," does that make any sense? That said, hey, I was looking for a sports watch, a Fitbit and I'm comparing specs and I'm doing all that stuff. And so that mode of buying is still happening, but I think, so yeah, when consumer products companies contact me, I usually say, "No." Occasionally they still say, "Okay, yeah, we'll build this, we still want to have this narrative." But yeah, I think it has the most value, most impactful right away for B2B enterprise technology companies.

Lenny (00:46:33):
Just a few more questions. One is just what's a sign that you should spend time in this area, that something is broken in your strategic narrative story pitch?

Andy Raskin (00:46:42):
Well, I can tell you what I hear from CEOs when they contact me. I always ask, what's happening? Because that idea I had, no CEO's going to budget a line item for this. I'm basically asking, why was I wrong? So a few things they tell me, one is that the company is maturing from a point a stage where they've been successful, but that success is ... one CEO put it this way, was brute force of the founders. So the founders are in every meeting, they're in every product discussion, every sales call, and that's shifting, the company's getting bigger.

Andy Raskin (00:47:21):
Usually I'm seeing this around series B where the company is getting ... so they can't be in every sales call, every market call and they're looking to transmit all the good stuff and some direction in a way that people are going to remember and all that. Everything from how we pitch to what the product should be and all that, and they see this as that.

Andy Raskin (00:47:47):
There's another point that I see people contacting me at, which is where they're growing. It's usually a bit later where they've scaled tremendously successfully. Now we're either acquiring or building out whole new product units. And that old story we told is just, it's just not big enough and we got to expand it to something bigger. This is the example of OneTrust, which the CEO I had on my podcast recently. Starts out with just, I think it's data privacy around the regulations that people have to be able to say, "Don't track me," things like that. And then they buy these other company and now we have this much bigger offering. So how do we tell the story? And then I guess the third one is some form of pivot where hey, we were telling an old story but whatever, the market changed or whatever and we want to go in a different direction.

Lenny (00:48:53):
Say a founders listening to this and they're like, "Okay, I realize I need to do this. I haven't spent enough time on this. Something's not working. This could be a huge unlock for us." What are the first couple steps they could take to start to figure this out? And I imagine at some point it's like, go talk to Andy. He'll help you through this. Is there stuff you can do on your own? How do you go about figuring this out?

Andy Raskin (00:49:11):
Well, a lot of folks have emailed me over the years like, well I told you before, there were some who emailed me like, "Hey, tried it, didn't work." But many more have emailed me, "Hey, I tried it, it did work. Thank you." And so yeah, just try to lay out that structure and try it mean even when I work with teams, I adapt what people might call sort of lean approach. I want to get that thing out there into sales calls. We're not rolling it out to the whole sales team right away, but getting it out into some sales calls and get a sense, "Hey, is this resonating? Are people given the nods?"

Andy Raskin (00:49:49):
Ideally by the way, one way I look to test it, is it working, is when we talk about this shift and the stakes and do they stick. Do they kind of say, "Yeah, let me tell you how that's playing out for us,"? Or, "Am I? Yes, I'm seeing that." Sometimes I'll literally, I'll train salespeople to ask them that question, like, "Am I crazy or are you seeing this?" And what do they say? And you can usually tell if they're in and it's qualitative. But I really like that kind of testing to see if it's working. And I think anybody can do that.

Lenny (00:50:32):
Is there a template or guide you have online for folks to follow other than maybe just listening to this podcast and reading? Is there a post that's like, "Here's the framework defined, and go follow these steps,"?

Andy Raskin (00:50:41):
I mean, I guess the closest is that The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen post, which is the Zuora deck. But even there, people have asked me for a framework and presentation companies say, "Can we have your template so we could make it available to people? We'll revenue share with you or something." And I am so against this template. Every team I work with, it's different. It's not the same number of slides. Sometimes we can lay out this shift in one slide, sometimes it just feels better or the team likes it better, whatever, if it's a few and we're sort of getting people into it. Sometimes there's no slides. So I am really hesitant to recommend any template. And what I'd say is these are principles for building it, not any prescribed formula.

Lenny (00:51:37):
If they do want to reach out to you while we're on this topic, what's the best way to contact you?

Andy Raskin (00:51:42):
Connect with me on LinkedIn. That's usually a good one. And I'm usually posting things on LinkedIn that I've learned from working with other teams.

Lenny (00:51:52):
Awesome. Last question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Speaking of LinkedIn, you posted how in a working session with companies that the second session is always this low point they all go through and that everyone's starting to get discouraged and pained. And first of all, I love the expectation setting. You're like, "This is going to suck initially and it'll get better." Why is that the low point and what is it that they focus on in that second session?

Andy Raskin (00:52:17):
Well, apparently I'm not doing enough of an expectation setting, because what that post was about was this woman. So when I work with a CEO I always ask them to create what I call a strategic narrative team of up to four people. And usually those are leads of marketing, sales, whatever. In this case, the CFO was a really important person in this company. And so the CEO wanted her as part of this team. And she said to me at the end, she's like, "I love where we got to." I always ask, "What worked? What didn't work?" And she's like, "I love where we got to. That worked great. What didn't work was like, you told us that this second session was going to be bad, but I think you could have drilled home more like exactly how bad."

Andy Raskin (00:52:58):
And then I asked her, "Actually, could I have that quote with your face on a slide that I now present to future teams?" She said, "Yeah, you could do that." So the way I work it is I have a kickoff session where essentially I'm asking people on the team, what are these pieces? What is this old game, new game shift? How do we talk about when to set the stakes and everything I just took you through? And we have like five people in the room. There's going to be ... we're going to come out of this with notes and notes, boards and boards of ideas of this stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:53:34):
And so then two things happen. One is I ask the team to start interviewing customers about how they see this shift and sometimes the customers will literally give us the words and that can be helpful in sort of aligning if we have differences. But I also start working with the CEO one-on-one and we build a first version of this thing, and it's the second session where we present this first version to the team and think about what's happening.

Andy Raskin (00:54:02):
The team has just given us millions of gold ideas, truly they're all ... and in order to make something sort of clean and powerful, the CO and I have had to pretty much throw out all of them, save one or two. And there's going to be feelings about that, first of all. Second of all, if this were easy to just get all ... interview everybody, come up with it, they would've done it. So it's going to be wrong.

Andy Raskin (00:54:30):
But the good news is this is where the team gets to weigh in. I also ask, what's working, not working in this thing? And when we learn how it's not working, that gives us the juice to then me and the CEO go back to the drawing board. We plan on this in advance, we're going to go back to the drawing board and then bring up something good. So having a shit draft is a million times more valuable than having all these great ideas. But it's also really painful. It's painful not only for them, but for me. No matter how many times I say this, I expect they're going to love it in that first one too. And I'm really pissed off when they don't. But luckily now I've done enough times I know that's going to happen.

Lenny (00:55:20):
I was just watching a documentary about Annie Lamont who came up with the first draft concept for writers that I stick to.

Andy Raskin (00:55:27):
I'm a firm believer in that. Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:30):
As you're talking, one last thought that I had is, so you'd work with because and founders. I feel like this could be just as useful to product leaders, product managers working on a product that they're launching, just like what is the movement, where it's happening, here's why this product's important. Do you find that too?

Andy Raskin (00:55:45):
Absolutely. And very frequently, the product leader, chief product officer is part of this group. What I'd say though is that the reason ... so after I did this work for a few years, I looked back and I was like, which were the engagements I did where I can see it, and the narrative is really this true north star for everything?

Andy Raskin (00:56:10):
It was always the ones where the CEO was leading it, not just in name, but literally the person who called me who was working on the drafts with me and going through. And so initially I didn't insist that it would be the CEO doing that, but eventually I started to, and I think even for a product leader, you're going to want the support. You don't want to be just telling that story in product. You're going to want that supported from this Zuora person who gave me the initial deck, he said it, "It was like I had air cover and I was just going down and knocking down deals on the ground." You're going to want that air cover in marketing, sales, recruiting, everything. And how much better is it if it's really driven by the CEO and you have that?

Lenny (00:57:01):
Amazing. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on or you want to share before we get to our very exciting lighting round?

Andy Raskin (00:57:07):
No, except I love category design people and it's really just sort of terms that I like that are ... you know what? Forget it. Scratch that part.

Lenny (00:57:19):
I thought that was funny.

Andy Raskin (00:57:21):
Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, we could leave it in. We could leave it in. You could even leave this in where I'm telling you to scratch it.

Lenny (00:57:26):
Sounds good. I was actually going to joke that I was going to cut this out and leave you hanging, but okay.

Andy Raskin (00:57:31):
No, you can do that. Yeah. Category design people. Love you. Don't hate me. Thank you.

Lenny (00:57:37):
Great. I love it. We're going to be okay, I think. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Andy Raskin (00:57:46):
I'm ready. I saw like what you sent them, but I didn't really look at them, so I'm just going to tell you what I said. I'll go off that.

Lenny (00:57:52):
Perfect. Excellent. The best version of this. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Andy Raskin (00:57:59):
One of the books that I read initially from that Barnes & Noble, it was Story by Robert McKee. I think a lot of people know about it who are sort of interested in story stuff, but it's kind of a Bible of people who are doing screenwriting and stuff. If anyone who's in Hollywood who thought about going to Hollywood, they know about this book. I love a book called Out of Sheer Rage. It's really not about what I do or anything, but the author is Geoff Dyer. Geoff, he's written a lot of books that are kind of essay memoir, and this is a book about him trying to write a book about DH Lawrence. So it's all about procrastinating and like, "Oh, I'm supposed to write this book. I'm about to go on a trip somewhere. Should I bring the collected works of DH Lawrence with me on the trip because that'll help me start the book, but maybe I shouldn't because it's not going to ... Then I could come back refreshed without having ..." Basically, it's all that. It's this sort of in the head. I just really enjoy that book.

Lenny (00:58:59):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Andy Raskin (00:59:03):
Station 11. Station 11. That was just so beautiful to me.

Lenny (00:59:09):
Trippy. That was a trippy movie. Did not expect to go where it went. I usually ask what's a favorite interview question you like to ask, and I don't know how often you're interviewing people, but does anything come to mind when I ask that?

Andy Raskin (00:59:21):
Well, I can tell you one thing I ask when I speak with CEOs is I like to ask, what role has this narrative played in your leadership? How does it work in your leadership? And it's always really interesting for me to hear that, 'cause I often hear things that I don't expect.

Lenny (00:59:39):
What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you just really like?

Andy Raskin (00:59:43):
I recently got a Fitbit. I think I may have mentioned it earlier. I was looking for a product like that, and so far I'm really loving it.

Lenny (00:59:53):
Amazing. Have you tried other versions of Fitbits or that's the one that's working?

Andy Raskin (00:59:58):
I also ordered a Polar at the same time and wound up returning the Polar. Basically, it was just a little clunkier on my wrist, so I went with a Fitbit. Well, do you have one that you recommend instead?

Lenny (01:00:13):
I just have the Apple Watch and I've never tried a Fitbit and it gives me all this stuff that seems cool, but I've never gone further.

Andy Raskin (01:00:21):
I got the Fitbit like a week ago and I actually still am on the fence whether I bring it back to return it for the Apple Watch, so I'm enjoying it, but we'll see.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Okay. Final question. You're expert on presentations and I imagine you spend a lot of time in decks, and so just what's like one small change people can make to how they put together a deck or a presentation that will make their presentation a lot better?

Andy Raskin (01:00:41):
This is the one thing, make the title the takeaway of the slide so that the person looking at it has to do zero work to take away. So example, you'll sometimes see, "The problem," or, "The team." Replace, "The team," with, "Our team is veterans of whatever industry," or every single slide it's a takeaway, not a label. It'll make everything flow a lot better.

Lenny (01:01:17):
You did a killer job answering the lightning round questions without having a peek at what they were going to be. Andy, this was incredibly insightful. I'm going to go start working on my strategic narrative for my podcast and newsletter. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe consider working with you? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:01:35):
So I mentioned LinkedIn as a way to connect with me. That's fine. My website is AndyRaskin.com. I also have a podcast where I talk with CEOs, so if you're interested in hearing more details about actual use of this, it's called The Bigger Narrative. My mom introduces every episode. I sent her the interviews in advance. I call her and interview about what she thinks people will get out of it, and that conversation becomes the intro to the podcast episode. And what was the last question?

Lenny (01:02:04):
How can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:02:06):
Useful to me. Just if you try any of this stuff, let me know. Like, "Hey, worked. Didn't work. Have this question." I would love to hear that stuff.

Lenny (01:02:17):
Amazing. Andy, thank you again for being here.

Andy Raskin (01:02:20):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. This is really fun.

## Transcript

Andy Raskin (00:00:00):
The way I learned how to pitch in business school, and I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatments. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. Every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, and I call this shift the shift from the old game to a new game. The archetypal example of this, I think in the business world, is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over and there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, new rules. That's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:00:54):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Andy Raskin. Andy helps CEOs and company leaders align their teams around something he calls a strategic narrative, which as you'll learn all about in this episode, is essentially a simple story that helps people understand why they need your product. And with that helps you align your sales, marketing, and product teams along with your fundraising and even your hiring efforts.

Lenny (00:01:25):
Andy has worked closely with some of the most successful founders and companies out there, including companies like Gong, Dropbox, Uber, Salesforce, Square, IBM, and many others. In our conversation, Andy explains why most people are pitching their product completely wrong, why focusing on the problem you're solving for people is no longer an effective pitch and how the strategic narrative helps you frame your solution in a much more effective way. Andy also shares a ton of examples of the framework in action, why focusing on categories and category creation is so limiting, signs your narrative needs to work and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Andy Raskin after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:07):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing a roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

Lenny (00:02:45):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

Lenny (00:04:16):
Andy, welcome to the podcast.

Andy Raskin (00:04:18):
Oh, thanks Lenny. So great to talk with you.

Lenny (00:04:21):
You are quite known as someone that helps CEOs optimize their pitch, their story, their strategy, which we're going to get deep into. But before we do that, can you just give us a little glimpse into how you found your way into this line of work?

Andy Raskin (00:04:35):
I started as a coder. I was a computer science major, undergrad, a friend and I had an idea for an app. So this was like during the dot com years. So Windows app, and we coded a little prototype and we started, we put it out there, we started getting some users and we thought, "Oh, okay, maybe we can get some investments." So of the two of us, I spoke English fluently. So we decided, okay, I'll write the investor pitch. So I wrote the pitch, we sent it out and the reaction was really bad. One VC wrote back and said, "Listen, I rate every plan I get on a scale of 1 to 10, and yours is a 1," and the next to the one he wrote in parentheses, "Worst," in case we thought maybe that was the top of his rating scale.

Lenny (00:05:20):
Brutal.

Andy Raskin (00:05:22):
Yeah, brutal. But then lower down, so this was back when they would like you'd print, send the hard copy of the plan and they might mail it back with comments written in. And he had written in, "Not a compelling story." A few weeks later, I'm walking by this Barnes & Noble and there's a sign in the window that says, "For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story," okay, that's me. And there's an arrow that points to these books and they turned out to be screenwriting books. I didn't know anything about this, so I started reading these books and it strikes me a movie is a pitch. What is Star Wars a pitch for? It's a pitch for be good, care about people, trust The Force in their terms. But I don't have couple hours. I'm pitching a business. It's very different. I'm not writing a three X screenplay.

Andy Raskin (00:06:11):
So what applies, what doesn't apply? I mean these are questions I think I'm still asking, but I did my best to take some of the learnings of how the movie was structured. It was very different from how my pitch was structured and kind of restructure it. And we did that and we sent the pitch out and we start getting more interest. It was really clear. And then we had a term sheet I think a few months later and I'm like, "What is this story thing?" That we didn't change the product, it was basically the same business just sort of how we talked about it. That was really interesting to me.

Andy Raskin (00:06:49):
I mean, over the next 10, 15 years, I thought about, "Hey, maybe I could do consulting with this." CEOs who heard about this were asking me about it. But I still was like, "No. No CEO's going to budget a line item for the story. That's not a thing." So I just didn't do it for a really long time until eventually I was proven wrong about that.

Lenny (00:07:13):
And how many years ago was this at this point?

Andy Raskin (00:07:15):
So this was dot com. This was like '98 when I was pitching that company.

Lenny (00:07:20):
Amazing. I think there's a couple interesting tidbits about this. One is that interesting opportunities arise when you're doing something you're excited about. So you had the startup, it didn't work out, but you had a problem that you solved for yourself and that led to another, a bigger opportunity for your career.

Andy Raskin (00:07:34):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:07:35):
So that's interesting. And then also just some of the best opportunities arise from solving your own problem, not planning to start something with it, but just like, "I have a problem." Turns out [inaudible 00:07:44]-

Andy Raskin (00:07:44):
Yeah, I think that's same with you. Right, Lenny? You started writing about stuff and boom, that became the thing.

Lenny (00:07:49):
Absolutely. It was not quite boom, but eventually it became boom.

Andy Raskin (00:07:53):
Feels like boom from outside.

Lenny (00:07:55):
Yeah, that's how it goes. It always overnight for everyone else that isn't here.

Andy Raskin (00:08:01):
Right, exactly.

Lenny (00:08:03):
Yeah. Okay, so let's get into it. So you help CEOs at this point come up with what you call a strategic narrative and you help them not only come up with this strategic narrative, but you help their teams align around this strategic narrative. So let's just start with what is a strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:08:19):
Yeah, you'd think, I've been doing this for 10 years, I'd have a very snappy definition of it there, and I don't know if I'm really happy with ... like I've ever found one that totally gets at it yet. The one thing I say is it's this one story that the CEO uses to drive success in marketing, sales, but also product. That it becomes like a north star, strategic north star for product roadmap, for fundraising, for recruiting, really everything.

Andy Raskin (00:08:54):
What I think is really interesting as a kind of qualifier is that this story has a certain structure. Like I said, when I found those screenwriting books, I sort of shifted the structure. And the traditional structure, the way I learned how to pitch in business school, I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatment.

Andy Raskin (00:09:24):
Not to say it's not better, but just this is the structure of it, and it kind of sets you up for bragging. Let me tell you why it's so great. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. In the movies, every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, in the character's world. And I call this shift the shift from the old game to the new game. And the archetypal example of this, I think in the business world is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over," meaning software in the sense that we're going to own it and maintain it, "And there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, like the new rules, everything has changed and that's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:10:34):
I think the Salesforce example is an awesome example of your approach. If they were thinking about it in the old way, what would Salesforce have done? How would they have pitched it if not for, "Everyone's moving to the cloud, your dumb for using desktop software,"?

Andy Raskin (00:10:48):
Well, I think they would've just come out and said like, "Oh hey ..." I mean CRM by the way, was already a category. I mean, already Siebel was the huge giant of that space. There were already even companies doing it online, doing it through the web. And so they would've come and said, "Oh, we're easier to install, faster to get up and running than Siebel," or, "We have this much functionality compared to," I think it was, was it NetSuite? Or, I don't know. It was some early Salesforce-like thing that was out there. They would've done these sort of comparison things.

Andy Raskin (00:11:25):
And Benioff, I mean he is a pretty proud guy. I think he did still say like, "Hey, we're the number one CRM," but wasn't what they led with. They led with this story about this fundamental paradigm shift and, are you in or are you not in? And what they did was instead of just saying, "Hey, we're better than," they said, "Hey, all those others, those Siebel's, they're part of that old game. You want to play that software game? Be my guest, go buy Siebel," and of course we know how it played out.

Lenny (00:12:02):
So the crux of the approach is instead of, "Problem, solution, you should go do this," it's, "The world is changing, here's where it's going and we're going to help you get there." I want go in a little more depth of the framework. But before that, what are some other examples to give people a sense of like, oh, I see, I understand what this might be.

Andy Raskin (00:12:19):
Yeah, so another great example and no coincidence, so is Zuora. So Zuora is the company I wrote about in this post called The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen, the CEO of Zuora, Tien Tzuo, was employee number 11 at Salesforce. So he learns this from Benioff. And he's pitching, "Hey, in the old world, businesses operated on transactions. You sold things to people outright. In this new world," he calls it the subscription economy, where people want the benefits of those things without necessarily having to pay for them. And of course gives all these examples of all the winners in this, look at all the winning companies. They're all basically going to this new model.

Andy Raskin (00:13:05):
And so he's pitching someone like Ford and you can imagine they're going to Ford and pitching a subscription for car service, which is quite different from just a lease. And they're starting out with this. This is the big shift. Another one, team I worked with early on, and I think they'd agree their story came out of this work was Gong. So Gong everyone probably knows by now, they take the video recordings of all your sales calls and they stick AI onto it and come out with all these insights. And that story is, hey, goodbye opinions. Used to be a world where sales is run on opinions. Hello reality, that now all the winners are adopting this new mindset where we really have to see what's really going on.

Lenny (00:13:56):
In the Gong example, let's say, what would they have done if they were going, "Here's the problem, here's the solution, here's what we're going to do for you,"?

Andy Raskin (00:14:03):
Yeah, I mean that's kind of what they were doing when they started out. And I'm not saying that didn't work totally. I mean already by the time they started doing this, they were starting to become a big company. I remember Bendov said to me, "Listen, Andy," they were around series B, I think this is around 2018. It's like, "We're going to be a huge company. The question is how huge. And I think that this narrative along the lines of Zuora or Salesforce, if we get this right, this is going to be a multiplier on our growth."

Andy Raskin (00:14:38):
So I don't remember exactly the pitch beforehand, but it was very much like, "Hey, we're going to record your calls. We're going to get insights from them. They're better than the insights you could get from Salesforce." There wasn't this kind of unifying kind of movement ideology that put it all in context. And what was really interesting was one thing, I don't think they'd be upset if I shared, and maybe it's known. Initially, they were seen as a tool for sales operations, for someone who's going to record the calls and what this narrative did for them. And I think it was already starting to happen, but what it really coalesced was this is a tool for sales leadership.

Lenny (00:15:23):
You talked about Zuora in the post you wrote, and I imagine many people listening are like, "Oh, shit. This is the guy that wrote that post that everyone's always sharing with me about how to make a deck." And I wanted to ask, how impactful was that one piece of writing for you in your career, just like as a tangent?

Andy Raskin (00:15:39):
I had written some other posts on Medium in particular. Medium has changed quite a bit, but back then I found that I could write stuff there and get really a lot of people who were interested in what I was interested would sort of come in and create some noise about it. So I was already doing this kind of work for a couple of years, but that post immediately got something like 2 million views around the world and I started getting inquiries from teams all over the world.

Andy Raskin (00:16:12):
And it was I think what really allowed me to say no, okay, I could do this work. That CEO's would budget a line item for this. Because I think if you really understand that post, it's not really about a sales deck, it's really about this story that Tien, the CEO is telling everywhere and that is showing up in the sales deck and structuring it that way.

Lenny (00:16:40):
I think it's just another example that comes up a bunch on this podcast is just the power of writing and the power of content. Yeah, and you're shaking your head.

Andy Raskin (00:16:48):
Totally. I mean, I had a little mini career as a journalist, as a freelance writer and I really loved that. I actually, I took a class in New York called How to Write a Magazine Article, because I was sort of mid-career, I was curious. And the class wound up being more about how to sell a magazine article. And I found I really loved that, pitching articles, but one thing that was always a downer for me was there's always this editor sort of deciding what's going to be out there.

Andy Raskin (00:17:23):
And when you work with a great editor, it's great, they make yourself better and they're priceless. But still there's this intermediary. What started to happen, I think around when I started writing around 2013, '14, you start to see these platforms, like Medium, even LinkedIn where you can just write and have this audience and I think no way I could do this, the work I do if that development hadn't happened first.

Lenny (00:17:53):
I'm taking us off track, but I want to go a little deeper with this. I find that there's kind of two paths to writing online. One is your path where you write one piece that just blows up like crazy. The other path is more my path where I just write consistently for a long time, and both work and most people try to go your path and they never succeed. It's really hard to make something gets 2 million views, but you can go that path.

Andy Raskin (00:18:14):
This is like you said earlier, hey, it seems like boom, but really it didn't. So that was probably the 30th or 40th piece and they were gradually getting more and more traction. There was one I wrote before that about, it's kind of dissecting Elon Musk's pitch for the Powerwall, the battery that they sell. And that one got maybe few hundred thousand views and also was a big jump. And then the next one got some poultry number. So what I find is like, yeah, there's this a while where you're writing and it feels like you're talking to nobody and then gradually it grows and you'll have these peaks, but then over time is where the magic is.

Lenny (00:19:03):
Okay, I'm really glad you pointed that out, that it rarely is just you write one thing and it's boom.

Andy Raskin (00:19:08):
I'll also say, sorry, because I worked in a magazine, I haven't done a newsletter because that idea of having a deadline all the time and constantly having to, we used to call the magazine Feed the Beast, I feel so free not to have that. So for now at least I haven't done that.

Lenny (00:19:27):
I know that well, so let me take us back on track and let's talk about just the high level framework here. So you talked about, it starts with this idea of tell people worlds changing, join this movement. What's the simple way to think about this, the pieces of this strategic narrative framework?

Andy Raskin (00:19:42):
A lot of times people will contact me, say, "Hey, I tried it, didn't work." Well, one very common thing, at least earlier was they would basically just take the Zuora deck, they'd get ahold of it and just put their logo on it. And so that's not going to work. One thing is we're not just saying, "Hey, the world is changing." And then sometimes I'll see, "The world is changing," and there'll be, "Used to be," and there's a long list of things and then, "Now it is," a long list of bullet points.

Andy Raskin (00:20:11):
What's really, I think key is naming it, naming that old game. The examples you saw, software, cloud, transactions, subscription opinions, reality. This very, very concise naming is really key. And it's hard because in making it compact you're losing completeness. So you can imagine you're in a meeting, someone says like, "Hey, how about we do transactions to subscriptions?" And someone says, "Well I don't know, there's a lot of things I don't really subscribe to. Subscription economy, really?" So we're always kind of overstating it in a way, but it's not a problem. I don't think people say like, "Oh that's wrong, subscription economy, because I still go to the grocery store and buy things." So anyway, that's the first piece.

Andy Raskin (00:20:59):
The second piece is what I call naming the stakes. And there's a few ways to do this, but one that's really great if we can do it is to name the winners to show that winners are already playing this new game. So for instance with Zuora they're saying, "Hey, look, look at all the new winners," this is like 2015 so, "Airbnb, Box," all these companies, they're already doing this subscription thing.

Andy Raskin (00:21:28):
And by the way, overall they show this scary stat about the longevity of Fortune 500 companies. It's getting smaller, and so it's a little disingenuous, but basically they make this case that, "Hey, companies are dying, the ones that are winning are doing this." And so to the extent we want to make this life and death just like a movie. This is again, I'll make the parallel to Star Wars. So Luke, he spends the first 15 minutes of the movie belly aching. He wants to be a pilot, he wants to go out and have adventures in space. So Obiwan comes, he says, "Hey, we got this mission, this princess we got to go," and all this stuff, "Let's go. I'll teach you to be a pilot. We'll go have adventures in space." What does Luke say? He says, "Ooh, you know what, I can't really get involved. They got to go home. It's late." Who does this sound like? The reluctant buyer.

Andy Raskin (00:22:27):
So yeah, "I want to be innovative and all this. Ooh, you know what? I don't have budget this quarter." So how does George Lucas change Luke's mind? He basically kills the aunt and uncle, sorry, spoilers, it's been 40 years though. If you haven't seen it, you're probably not going to see it. Kills the aunt and uncle. Now it's pretty clear they're coming for Luke. Now the stakes are life and death. Probably he's going to be dead. But there is this other path that Obiwan holds out for him.

Andy Raskin (00:22:55):
And whenever I work with teams and I talk about this, so they're like, "Okay, I guess we got to then for kill the prospect's aunt and uncle," and basically yes, I mean figuratively. We got to show them that the future is not going to just be sort of okay. People talk about making it emotional and I've always wondered, what does that mean? Literally, what is the definition? This is for me the definition, is that the prospect doesn't see the future as sort of okay. They see it as split between a very negative outcome and a potentially very positive outcome.

Andy Raskin (00:23:29):
The third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game. I used to call it the promised land message, but I've changed it to this because I've found that it's sort of a little more fruitful. This subscription economy, transactions, it can get a little highfalutin and sort of big, but on the website when we just have to boil it down to a couple of words that's going to be clear right away, what can we say? And I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers. Very simple. It just sort of flows from it. Airbnb for a while had this one, live anywhere. If you think about-

Lenny (00:24:21):
Belong anywhere.

Andy Raskin (00:24:23):
Well actually it was-

Lenny (00:24:24):
Oh, live like a human.

Andy Raskin (00:24:25):
So you're right, it was, "Belong anywhere," and then it switched to, "Live there." I may have the chronology wrong, but it was the two of those things. You know better than I do. But either one, I mean think they're saying very similar things. Hey, there's this new world where you don't have to live in hotels, you can stay in people's houses. What's the object of that game is to belong anywhere, but live there. And I love it when it works that way where it's almost like an asymptotically unachievable thing. You are never literally going to live there. And if you think about it, this buyer mission statement, this rallying cry, I think of it really as the mission of the company. I mean, what is the mission of Airbnb other than to help people live there if they're going to be customer focused and all that?

Andy Raskin (00:25:17):
The fourth piece is, okay, well this object of the game, winning this game, it better be hard because if it's not, why would we even exist? Just with the movie, if Luke can just go destroy the Death Star then no movie. So there's got to be sort of obstacles in the way, things that are preventing them from. So saying, "Okay, you want to turn customers into subscribers." So whereas Zuora, where they go next is to say, "Okay, well how are you going to measure lifetime value?" Because now you have this always on thing. "How are you going to measure preferences and how they're changing over?" All these new kind of challenges that didn't exist before. And then these are like the monsters in Lord of the Rings or the Empire in Star Wars, these are the obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:26:11):
I think about them because they sound like problems. This is what people would normally say, "Oh, these are the problems we solve." But by setting up this story thing first we've repackaged them as obstacles to a new goal state that we've already positioned as life and death. So they take on this much more emotional meaning. We understand why they matter. And then of course the last piece is now talking about, well, how are we going to overcome these obstacles? Narrative people, in the movie business they call these the magic gifts that the main character gets to go help them win. What are the ways? Now we can talk about that and success stories and all the rest of the stuff.

Lenny (00:26:58):
There's some obvious parallels to the hero's journey here. I imagine that it was a source of inspiration, and the Star Wars I think is the epitome of that journey. Can you talk about just how related those two are, how you think about that?

Andy Raskin (00:27:09):
Yeah, I mean so hero's journey is this book that comes from, I think it's Hero of A Thousand Faces is a book by Joseph Campbell, a sociologist. He looks at myths over different cultures and different times and he finds this kind of common structure that he calls the hero's journey. I mean it's some controversy about that, about his book. Is it a very male oriented sort of take on things and a bunch of things.

Andy Raskin (00:27:38):
But even that aside, I found when I would talk about hero's journey and stuff, it's just like, it didn't really tell me what to do. Yeah, okay, yeah I got to do this pitch. So in the hero's journey there's like refusal of the call. That's actually that thing where Luke says he doesn't want to go and where the buyer says, "Hey, I don't have budget." But I don't know, it was just too theoretical for me to really ... when I use it, people seem to sort of glass over. So I just don't really talk about that at all. But yeah, I mean that's behind a lot of this stuff for sure.

Lenny (00:28:17):
Yeah, that makes sense because I think if people hear about that all the time when they're like, become a better storyteller, tell your story in this hero's journey, and it's like, "I don't know what I'm doing."

Andy Raskin (00:28:25):
Also, I would say there's storytelling as a skill kind of thing, which is a great thing. Learn how to tell stories better, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not really interested in that in my work, what I'm interested in is the one story and the structure of that one story. And this one story, it doesn't really have ... like, the world is moved from transactions to subscriptions. There's not a main character in that story who's like having a problem and getting saved. It's almost as if what's happening is we're turning the person we talk to into the main character. By spelling out the shift, we're changing their world and we're saying, "Hey, you got to change and you want to come with us."

Lenny (00:29:13):
It's almost like you're putting them into the hero's journey, like, "Here's how you win."

Andy Raskin (00:29:16):
Exactly. I love that.

Lenny (00:29:18):
Let me just try to summarize what you shared, this five step framework. So you start with here's a new movement that's happening and you want to name it, you want to name the stakes and there's winners and losers and here's already happening and it's really important. Then you want to name the object of the new game, like turning customers into subscribers. Then show the obstacles, here's why it's challenging, and then talk about how you're going to overcome these obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:29:41):
And by the way, the naming of the object of the new game, I find it often is really nice to do it as a question. So we hey, there's this shift from transactions to subscriptions and look, everyone's doing it. So we asked a simple question, what would it take to turn every customer into a subscriber? And this way we're kind of bringing the person we're pitching to almost like they're coming along with us as a co, I don't know, adventurer in crafting this story.

Lenny (00:30:17):
I love that. This episode is brought to you by Eco. Last month Eco users earned an average of $84 in cash back rewards. How? With Eco the future of personal finance. Eco is the update to a misaligned financial system providing an app that works just like your bank but removes almost all of the middlemen, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time automatically.

Lenny (00:30:40):
What if you earn rewards for paying your rent or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online or even earn rewards for saving each month? And then imagine if you got rewarded again just for getting rewarded. With Eco, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cash back plus Eco's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are Eco points, the world's first open reward system. You earn them whenever you do almost anything in the eco app. Eco is working to make these points the most rewarding points ever so it pays to be early.

Maybe just to reinforce this even more, what if we go through the five steps and just with one company as an example and just talk about what each of those were for them?

Andy Raskin (00:31:41):
Okay, great. So there's a company called 360Learning. So this company, I don't know if folks know, but this company is raised over $200 million. They're in the space of corporate training software. So big companies, they have to train their people on all kinds of stuff. So you want to go through that one?

Lenny (00:32:01):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Andy Raskin (00:32:03):
Okay, great. By the way, Nick Hernandez is the CEO and Nick's been on my podcast, so he's talked about this. So they for a long time were pitching themselves as collaborative learning. So they have features that let people sort of collaborate on courses and all kinds of stuff. And Nick is often pitching CEOs, of course his team is as well. And he told me that it was sort of falling a little bit flat. People, collaborative learning, whatever. How are you different from this learning platform, this learning platform?

Andy Raskin (00:32:42):
And so when we worked together this collaborative learning, it's almost like a category name or a descriptor or something. They were so embedded that I decided, I don't even want to take it out, but can we define it in terms of a story? So the story they came to was, hey, used to be that companies train their people through basically a mindset of top-down learning. There's going to be some learning guru at the company, they're going to get all the courses, they're going to put it all together and sort of send out this training material to everybody.

Andy Raskin (00:33:23):
What's happening now is winning companies are approaching this differently. They're adopting this approach we might call upskill from within, which is if you look at Google, there's this page where I think you can go, it's a public. You can connect with Google's AI experts. They literally turn their internal experts into champions that are educating, not even just the company but even external people. They've created this culture of our own people are going to be the educators. So that's the shift from top down to this upskill from within. And of course I just even started to do the second piece which was like, hey, look at the big companies who are doing this.

Andy Raskin (00:34:10):
And then I think they showed, "Hey, you're not doing this. Look, training is becoming very expensive. People don't care. So this is the downside. So we're creating these sort of stake ..." And also I think he has something about how training now, like companies, if you don't adapt, if you can't get these skills to your people, if you're a car company and you can't get these skills around electric cars, you're dead.

Andy Raskin (00:34:35):
Nick was in France and he saw this poster, a recruiting poster from McDonald's and it said, "Hey, if you work at McDonald's you're going to learn from everybody else on your team." And it was like, wow, there it is. So there's another example we used as a kind of winner example. And so then the question became, I can't remember exactly, it was something like, how do you upskill from within? What would it take for you to turn your experts into champions of learning in the company and turn them into stars, and all this?

Andy Raskin (00:35:06):
And then I'm going to forget here what all the obstacles were. But I think it was things like, well, how are you going to make it possible for anybody to create a course? People who might have expertise in electric engines but don't know how to create a course, how are you going to make sure that there's still the learning department, they're going to keep control and can ... all this. You can imagine all the different kind of questions. And then of course now 360Learning starts talking about all that stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:35:36):
What Nick has told me, I'm actually going to be on a webinar with Nick where someone asked me, "Could you bring in a CEO who could talk about this stuff? Not just you B blabbing on about strategic narrative." And so Nick is going to join it. And we had a dress rehearsal the other day and he was telling me it's just like when he starts with this now he doesn't even get the question anymore of well how are you different from this other learning platform? Which used to always be the thing. It's just a much more seamless, okay, yeah, talk to our learning people, get this going. So it's just sounds like it's been really effective for them.

Lenny (00:36:13):
That's actually was what I was going to ask next is what kind of impact have you seen with someone shifting their pitch story from this doc? What was the arrogant doctor approach to the strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:36:23):
Yeah, I mean it's always this kind of thing I hear. I mean, of course it's very difficult to measure this. I mean, what was the value of the strategic narrative for Gong and its growth? Was it 3X versus 1X, 2X? Or I don't, who knows, right? But the things I hear from CEOs, a few things. One is that when they're pitching, they're not pitching features out of context, they're pitching now a movement which is a lot better place to be, I think. In a way you're not pitching product. Product is like a prop for making the story come true. Very important prop, but there's this higher level overlay that becomes the focus of the conversation, at first, and of course we're going to get into product and that helps sell. Once we have this story then everything in marketing can be all about this story.

Andy Raskin (00:37:21):
With Zuora, if you look at their website, well when they first started doing this, maybe 80% of the content is not, "Hey, let me tell you about how Zuora is so great," or, "Here's our new release," or whatever. It's, "Here's how music companies are embracing subscriptions. Here's how luxury goods companies are embracing subscriptions." It's all these kind of almost trend pieces that become unlimited fodder. And again, you're not touting your ... it's less salesy, right?

Andy Raskin (00:37:51):
Another thing I just hear always, I just interviewed a CEO this morning for my podcast and this is the first thing he actually said was, "It becomes the strategic north star for the product." So what he was telling me, and this was actually a little unusual, I asked him, "Why did you come to me at first?" And of course I'd asked him that before, but he said something this time that was a little different from what I'd heard before. He said, "We are constantly getting feature requests through sales, through customer success. And we had sort of no way, bar to decide well what do we take on, what don't we take on? And this clearly has become our bar."

Andy Raskin (00:38:38):
If you think about it for 360Learning, does it help us upskill from within? It's in. Does it not? Or it's prioritized. Does it not? Less prioritized. Amit Bendov told me this directly, he said we exactly the same thing. He said, "We get a lot of requests for features and a lot of them are basically about opinions, some way to record opinions."

Lenny (00:39:04):
And this is Gong.

Andy Raskin (00:39:04):
"We're not going to do those." In Gong, yeah. "We're not going to do those."

Lenny (00:39:08):
Are there any companies out there that maybe aren't clients that you see as like, wow, these guys are nailing it and they're doing a great job of this strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:39:15):
Well, one that really comes to mind is, I mean it's been out there for a while, but Drift. Drift comes out with essentially like a chatbot for your website, which might be the 30th chatbot for your website. And they don't say, "Hey, here's why our chatbot is the best one." They start from a completely different place, which is, "Hey, used to be people would sort of wait around for you to get back to them. It was a world of later. They called it the world of forms. You put up a web form and you expect someone's going to fill it out and maybe wait a few days while you take your sweet time deciding if you're going to get back to them."

Andy Raskin (00:39:58):
And David Cancel and David Gerhardt started from right the beginning saying, "Now we're in a world of now, where buyers are ..." I think they showed this woman, I remember it was this woman sleeping with her phone. That's your prospect. They're always on and they're going to expect you to be engaging with them right away. And they called this conversational marketing, and they really went with that and created I think a whole movement and they broke away from all of the other chatbots.

Lenny (00:40:35):
Awesome example. So earlier you threw out this word category, and I've noticed you haven't talked about category and category creation too much, and I think that you're kind of not a fan of this idea of creating a category and focusing on category. I'd love to hear your perspective on how that all relates to the stuff you recommend.

Andy Raskin (00:40:55):
Lenny, are you trying to get me in trouble? Like that guy who guy on your podcast who attacked jobs to be done?

Lenny (00:41:02):
Apparently, let's do it. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into.

Andy Raskin (00:41:06):
I would soften it a little bit and not just ... because I don't want the ire of the category design folks, but I really would soften and say, I wouldn't say I'm not a fan of creating category. Look, I think if you look at Play Bigger, which has become The Bible of that category creation thing, if you look behind that going to, what do they say the category is? They say it's a narrative. It's a story about how the world was to how it is. And so what I find though is that when people think about category creation, they tend to just focus on, okay, well, what is this category name going to be that we got? What are these three words or two words, whatever, that are going to magically make us seem like we're totally different from everybody else?

Andy Raskin (00:41:52):
And A, I think that's not really possible. These three words aren't going to do it. Take Gong, I mean already other companies were using this term revenue intelligence. With Gong, it suddenly becomes a thing because I think they have this opinions-to-reality story behind it. At one point, again, I asked Amit, he said, "Yeah," because I remember he really struggled, "What should we call it? What should we call it?"

Andy Raskin (00:42:20):
He came up with that one. But then when I asked him later, he is like, "Yeah, you know what? In hindsight we probably could have called it strawberry intelligence. It didn't matter. It was really the story that sort of mattered." I think he was exaggerating a little bit. And I think the category people would actually agree with this, I think they would agree with, hey, these three words are, it's sort of a shorthand for this movement of old game narrative.

Andy Raskin (00:42:48):
But I guess I feel like still by calling it category and category name, we're just focusing on those three words so much. And what happens often is CEOs will, they'll kind of come up with this little category, like what happened with Nick at the 360Learning with collaborative learning. We have this name, but we don't know how to tell the story around it. So my feeling is like, well, let's focus on the story. So that's why I talk about strategic narrative and movement creation versus category creation. If someone decides that your movement is a category, great. Bonus.

Lenny (00:43:32):
I see. So essentially your approach is category can play a part of this, but there's a bigger question you have of what's the story, what's the movement, what are the obstacles and categories and element of that potentially?

Andy Raskin (00:43:45):
I mean, I almost see them as orthogonal, like with HubSpot. HubSpot had this narrative around inbound. It used to be just outbound stuff, now we're going to have inbound. And that wasn't really a category. Back then they were probably known as marketing automation. Now they're probably known as CRM because they've broadened. But this movement is the thing that's sort of the constant and in some ways orthogonal to whatever category they're in.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Is the strategic narrative framework right for essentially any company or is there a sweet spot? And I've noticed most of the companies you've been talking about are B2B SaaS. So I don't know, maybe if there's a spectrum of perfect fit for strategic narrative framework and then not a fit at all. What's along that spectrum?

Andy Raskin (00:44:33):
Yeah, well you can see, I mean it takes a little time to tell this story and you were kind of framing it a little bit and we're telling it in lots of different channels. So I think it does really play well in this enterprise sales context because also we have a group buyer there. So it's not just one person who's doing some research. This whole group has to have a uniting story. So I think you're right that in noticing that the companies that this tends to resonate with tend to be B2B, enterprise sales, technology I think because often the product is very complicated. That arrogant doctor stuff comes from an age when the things people were selling were products on shelves that didn't change much, cans of soup at the supermarket or a car in a dealership. Even software back then, shrink-wrapped in a box, doesn't change.

Andy Raskin (00:45:44):
B2B software, this stuff is changing by the minute. And does it even make sense to make a claim to say, "Oh, we have these features and they have those features, therefore we're better," does that make any sense? That said, hey, I was looking for a sports watch, a Fitbit and I'm comparing specs and I'm doing all that stuff. And so that mode of buying is still happening, but I think, so yeah, when consumer products companies contact me, I usually say, "No." Occasionally they still say, "Okay, yeah, we'll build this, we still want to have this narrative." But yeah, I think it has the most value, most impactful right away for B2B enterprise technology companies.

Lenny (00:46:33):
Just a few more questions. One is just what's a sign that you should spend time in this area, that something is broken in your strategic narrative story pitch?

Andy Raskin (00:46:42):
Well, I can tell you what I hear from CEOs when they contact me. I always ask, what's happening? Because that idea I had, no CEO's going to budget a line item for this. I'm basically asking, why was I wrong? So a few things they tell me, one is that the company is maturing from a point a stage where they've been successful, but that success is ... one CEO put it this way, was brute force of the founders. So the founders are in every meeting, they're in every product discussion, every sales call, and that's shifting, the company's getting bigger.

Andy Raskin (00:47:21):
Usually I'm seeing this around series B where the company is getting ... so they can't be in every sales call, every market call and they're looking to transmit all the good stuff and some direction in a way that people are going to remember and all that. Everything from how we pitch to what the product should be and all that, and they see this as that.

Andy Raskin (00:47:47):
There's another point that I see people contacting me at, which is where they're growing. It's usually a bit later where they've scaled tremendously successfully. Now we're either acquiring or building out whole new product units. And that old story we told is just, it's just not big enough and we got to expand it to something bigger. This is the example of OneTrust, which the CEO I had on my podcast recently. Starts out with just, I think it's data privacy around the regulations that people have to be able to say, "Don't track me," things like that. And then they buy these other company and now we have this much bigger offering. So how do we tell the story? And then I guess the third one is some form of pivot where hey, we were telling an old story but whatever, the market changed or whatever and we want to go in a different direction.

Lenny (00:48:53):
Say a founders listening to this and they're like, "Okay, I realize I need to do this. I haven't spent enough time on this. Something's not working. This could be a huge unlock for us." What are the first couple steps they could take to start to figure this out? And I imagine at some point it's like, go talk to Andy. He'll help you through this. Is there stuff you can do on your own? How do you go about figuring this out?

Andy Raskin (00:49:11):
Well, a lot of folks have emailed me over the years like, well I told you before, there were some who emailed me like, "Hey, tried it, didn't work." But many more have emailed me, "Hey, I tried it, it did work. Thank you." And so yeah, just try to lay out that structure and try it mean even when I work with teams, I adapt what people might call sort of lean approach. I want to get that thing out there into sales calls. We're not rolling it out to the whole sales team right away, but getting it out into some sales calls and get a sense, "Hey, is this resonating? Are people given the nods?"

Andy Raskin (00:49:49):
Ideally by the way, one way I look to test it, is it working, is when we talk about this shift and the stakes and do they stick. Do they kind of say, "Yeah, let me tell you how that's playing out for us,"? Or, "Am I? Yes, I'm seeing that." Sometimes I'll literally, I'll train salespeople to ask them that question, like, "Am I crazy or are you seeing this?" And what do they say? And you can usually tell if they're in and it's qualitative. But I really like that kind of testing to see if it's working. And I think anybody can do that.

Lenny (00:50:32):
Is there a template or guide you have online for folks to follow other than maybe just listening to this podcast and reading? Is there a post that's like, "Here's the framework defined, and go follow these steps,"?

Andy Raskin (00:50:41):
I mean, I guess the closest is that The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen post, which is the Zuora deck. But even there, people have asked me for a framework and presentation companies say, "Can we have your template so we could make it available to people? We'll revenue share with you or something." And I am so against this template. Every team I work with, it's different. It's not the same number of slides. Sometimes we can lay out this shift in one slide, sometimes it just feels better or the team likes it better, whatever, if it's a few and we're sort of getting people into it. Sometimes there's no slides. So I am really hesitant to recommend any template. And what I'd say is these are principles for building it, not any prescribed formula.

Lenny (00:51:37):
If they do want to reach out to you while we're on this topic, what's the best way to contact you?

Andy Raskin (00:51:42):
Connect with me on LinkedIn. That's usually a good one. And I'm usually posting things on LinkedIn that I've learned from working with other teams.

Lenny (00:51:52):
Awesome. Last question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Speaking of LinkedIn, you posted how in a working session with companies that the second session is always this low point they all go through and that everyone's starting to get discouraged and pained. And first of all, I love the expectation setting. You're like, "This is going to suck initially and it'll get better." Why is that the low point and what is it that they focus on in that second session?

Andy Raskin (00:52:17):
Well, apparently I'm not doing enough of an expectation setting, because what that post was about was this woman. So when I work with a CEO I always ask them to create what I call a strategic narrative team of up to four people. And usually those are leads of marketing, sales, whatever. In this case, the CFO was a really important person in this company. And so the CEO wanted her as part of this team. And she said to me at the end, she's like, "I love where we got to." I always ask, "What worked? What didn't work?" And she's like, "I love where we got to. That worked great. What didn't work was like, you told us that this second session was going to be bad, but I think you could have drilled home more like exactly how bad."

Andy Raskin (00:52:58):
And then I asked her, "Actually, could I have that quote with your face on a slide that I now present to future teams?" She said, "Yeah, you could do that." So the way I work it is I have a kickoff session where essentially I'm asking people on the team, what are these pieces? What is this old game, new game shift? How do we talk about when to set the stakes and everything I just took you through? And we have like five people in the room. There's going to be ... we're going to come out of this with notes and notes, boards and boards of ideas of this stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:53:34):
And so then two things happen. One is I ask the team to start interviewing customers about how they see this shift and sometimes the customers will literally give us the words and that can be helpful in sort of aligning if we have differences. But I also start working with the CEO one-on-one and we build a first version of this thing, and it's the second session where we present this first version to the team and think about what's happening.

Andy Raskin (00:54:02):
The team has just given us millions of gold ideas, truly they're all ... and in order to make something sort of clean and powerful, the CO and I have had to pretty much throw out all of them, save one or two. And there's going to be feelings about that, first of all. Second of all, if this were easy to just get all ... interview everybody, come up with it, they would've done it. So it's going to be wrong.

Andy Raskin (00:54:30):
But the good news is this is where the team gets to weigh in. I also ask, what's working, not working in this thing? And when we learn how it's not working, that gives us the juice to then me and the CEO go back to the drawing board. We plan on this in advance, we're going to go back to the drawing board and then bring up something good. So having a shit draft is a million times more valuable than having all these great ideas. But it's also really painful. It's painful not only for them, but for me. No matter how many times I say this, I expect they're going to love it in that first one too. And I'm really pissed off when they don't. But luckily now I've done enough times I know that's going to happen.

Lenny (00:55:20):
I was just watching a documentary about Annie Lamont who came up with the first draft concept for writers that I stick to.

Andy Raskin (00:55:27):
I'm a firm believer in that. Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:30):
As you're talking, one last thought that I had is, so you'd work with because and founders. I feel like this could be just as useful to product leaders, product managers working on a product that they're launching, just like what is the movement, where it's happening, here's why this product's important. Do you find that too?

Andy Raskin (00:55:45):
Absolutely. And very frequently, the product leader, chief product officer is part of this group. What I'd say though is that the reason ... so after I did this work for a few years, I looked back and I was like, which were the engagements I did where I can see it, and the narrative is really this true north star for everything?

Andy Raskin (00:56:10):
It was always the ones where the CEO was leading it, not just in name, but literally the person who called me who was working on the drafts with me and going through. And so initially I didn't insist that it would be the CEO doing that, but eventually I started to, and I think even for a product leader, you're going to want the support. You don't want to be just telling that story in product. You're going to want that supported from this Zuora person who gave me the initial deck, he said it, "It was like I had air cover and I was just going down and knocking down deals on the ground." You're going to want that air cover in marketing, sales, recruiting, everything. And how much better is it if it's really driven by the CEO and you have that?

Lenny (00:57:01):
Amazing. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on or you want to share before we get to our very exciting lighting round?

Andy Raskin (00:57:07):
No, except I love category design people and it's really just sort of terms that I like that are ... you know what? Forget it. Scratch that part.

Lenny (00:57:19):
I thought that was funny.

Andy Raskin (00:57:21):
Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, we could leave it in. We could leave it in. You could even leave this in where I'm telling you to scratch it.

Lenny (00:57:26):
Sounds good. I was actually going to joke that I was going to cut this out and leave you hanging, but okay.

Andy Raskin (00:57:31):
No, you can do that. Yeah. Category design people. Love you. Don't hate me. Thank you.

Lenny (00:57:37):
Great. I love it. We're going to be okay, I think. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Andy Raskin (00:57:46):
I'm ready. I saw like what you sent them, but I didn't really look at them, so I'm just going to tell you what I said. I'll go off that.

Lenny (00:57:52):
Perfect. Excellent. The best version of this. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Andy Raskin (00:57:59):
One of the books that I read initially from that Barnes & Noble, it was Story by Robert McKee. I think a lot of people know about it who are sort of interested in story stuff, but it's kind of a Bible of people who are doing screenwriting and stuff. If anyone who's in Hollywood who thought about going to Hollywood, they know about this book. I love a book called Out of Sheer Rage. It's really not about what I do or anything, but the author is Geoff Dyer. Geoff, he's written a lot of books that are kind of essay memoir, and this is a book about him trying to write a book about DH Lawrence. So it's all about procrastinating and like, "Oh, I'm supposed to write this book. I'm about to go on a trip somewhere. Should I bring the collected works of DH Lawrence with me on the trip because that'll help me start the book, but maybe I shouldn't because it's not going to ... Then I could come back refreshed without having ..." Basically, it's all that. It's this sort of in the head. I just really enjoy that book.

Lenny (00:58:59):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Andy Raskin (00:59:03):
Station 11. Station 11. That was just so beautiful to me.

Lenny (00:59:09):
Trippy. That was a trippy movie. Did not expect to go where it went. I usually ask what's a favorite interview question you like to ask, and I don't know how often you're interviewing people, but does anything come to mind when I ask that?

Andy Raskin (00:59:21):
Well, I can tell you one thing I ask when I speak with CEOs is I like to ask, what role has this narrative played in your leadership? How does it work in your leadership? And it's always really interesting for me to hear that, 'cause I often hear things that I don't expect.

Lenny (00:59:39):
What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you just really like?

Andy Raskin (00:59:43):
I recently got a Fitbit. I think I may have mentioned it earlier. I was looking for a product like that, and so far I'm really loving it.

Lenny (00:59:53):
Amazing. Have you tried other versions of Fitbits or that's the one that's working?

Andy Raskin (00:59:58):
I also ordered a Polar at the same time and wound up returning the Polar. Basically, it was just a little clunkier on my wrist, so I went with a Fitbit. Well, do you have one that you recommend instead?

Lenny (01:00:13):
I just have the Apple Watch and I've never tried a Fitbit and it gives me all this stuff that seems cool, but I've never gone further.

Andy Raskin (01:00:21):
I got the Fitbit like a week ago and I actually still am on the fence whether I bring it back to return it for the Apple Watch, so I'm enjoying it, but we'll see.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Okay. Final question. You're expert on presentations and I imagine you spend a lot of time in decks, and so just what's like one small change people can make to how they put together a deck or a presentation that will make their presentation a lot better?

Andy Raskin (01:00:41):
This is the one thing, make the title the takeaway of the slide so that the person looking at it has to do zero work to take away. So example, you'll sometimes see, "The problem," or, "The team." Replace, "The team," with, "Our team is veterans of whatever industry," or every single slide it's a takeaway, not a label. It'll make everything flow a lot better.

Lenny (01:01:17):
You did a killer job answering the lightning round questions without having a peek at what they were going to be. Andy, this was incredibly insightful. I'm going to go start working on my strategic narrative for my podcast and newsletter. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe consider working with you? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:01:35):
So I mentioned LinkedIn as a way to connect with me. That's fine. My website is AndyRaskin.com. I also have a podcast where I talk with CEOs, so if you're interested in hearing more details about actual use of this, it's called The Bigger Narrative. My mom introduces every episode. I sent her the interviews in advance. I call her and interview about what she thinks people will get out of it, and that conversation becomes the intro to the podcast episode. And what was the last question?

Lenny (01:02:04):
How can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:02:06):
Useful to me. Just if you try any of this stuff, let me know. Like, "Hey, worked. Didn't work. Have this question." I would love to hear that stuff.

Lenny (01:02:17):
Amazing. Andy, thank you again for being here.

Andy Raskin (01:02:20):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. This is really fun.

## Transcript

Anneka Gupta (00:00:00):
When people say, "I want someone that's strategic," what they're really saying is, "I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product." So that's number one. And the second piece is, "I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on." And I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Today my guest is Anneka Gupta. Anneka is Chief Product Officer at Rubrik, a lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and on the board of Tinuiti. Previously, she was President, GM, and head of product at LiveRamp, where she spent 11 years and joined as one of their earliest employees. A bunch of former guests recommended Anneka Come on this podcast and you'll soon see why.

(00:01:03):
In our conversation, Anneka shares a ton of powerful advice on navigating difficult personalities, giving and hearing hard feedback, bringing humor and gratitude to every situation, managing your energy versus managing your time. Super tactical tips for how to become more strategic and how to make better decisions, and also how to break into product management for people that are trying to become product managers. There's something in this episode for everyone and I am excited for you to learn from Anneka. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Anneka Gupta. Anneka, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Anneka Gupta (00:01:51):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:52):
So, I want to start with a question that I've started to ask guests that come on the podcast that have had extraordinarily successful careers and also just consistently successful careers. So here's the question. What do you believe are one or two skills or mindsets or habits that you think most contributed to your success that you think might be helpful for other people to learn and build to help them have more successful careers?

Anneka Gupta (00:02:18):
So it's funny, before we kicked this off, you talked about the post-it that you have on your computer that says have fun. My one mindset that I really have leaned into after someone actually gave me advice on this is to figure out how to have fun in my job, even in the most difficult of times. The reason why I say that is because when you're hit with really hard times, it's easy to operate from a mindset of scarcity and to look at everything as an unachievable hurdle to overcome. And when I was able to switch my mindset and say, "Well, I'm actually going to figure out a way to have fun with this," it actually changed my entire for how to deal with super difficult situations.

(00:03:03):
This advice specifically came up to me when I had a scenario where I had to essentially change out all of my direct reports in very short order, and I figured that out. It was a super daunting situation. I didn't know how I was going to manage and at first I felt so scared by what was ahead of me and how much change I was going to have to go through in a very short period of time. But when I got this advice, I started to try to reframe my thinking and it actually really made it so that I was able to get through that hard time and opened my mind up to so many more opportunities. So, now I try to embody that in every situation that I come across where I'm faced with something super, super challenging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:45):
I love this advice. It's something that I've recently seen also in public speaking. If you can just reframe your thinking from "I'm scared of this" to "This is going to be fun. I'm going to have so much fun doing this. It's going to be like this energy and anxiety I'm feeling is me feeling like it's going to be a lot of fun." So, spending a little more time here, how do you actually do this? So in this case, you shared an example of basically you have to fire a bunch of people, not something one can quickly think about how to have fun with that. How did you do this? Is it just in your mind you're like, "I'm going to have fun with this," or is there something tactically people can do to make something fun?

Anneka Gupta (00:04:18):
I think there were a couple of things that I did and I've continued to do. One is figure out and really look at the situation and ask myself, what can I learn from this situation? What can I get out of this that's a positive outcome even though it is incredibly challenging to be facing it right now? So that's one thing that I've done. The second thing I think that has been really helpful is in going into meetings or other situations where I was trying to figure out how to collectively solve some big challenge, figuring out how to bring humor into the meeting. Just starting it on a light note and that elevated my own mood and way I was approaching the meeting, but also adds a level of levity to the situation for other people as well, which I think as a leader is super important because it's not just about your own mindset, but how are you transferring that mindset to the people that you're working with and the people that are working for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:12):
Got it. So part of it is just like, "How do I add a little humor?" Part of it is just thinking, "How do I make this fun?" Is part of this just like this is not as important as people make it out to be and we could just have a little fun with this thing. It doesn't have to be like we're not curing cancer.

Anneka Gupta (00:05:28):
Yeah, definitely I think that helps. Reflecting on this too, I feel like a lot of it comes down to the amount of emotional and mental energy I can bring to solving a problem. And there's always so much going on in life, like personal life as well as professional life, trying to figure out how can I architect my day and time to maximize my energy and be able to bring my full self to work and to these difficult so that I can have that mindset to look at things more broadly versus operating from a place of scarcity. That may come down to simple things like making sure that I have lunch. Sometimes when things get so busy you're like, "Oh, I'm just going to grab a protein bar and I'm going to skip lunch." But I found that that really decreases my energy.

(00:06:15):
Or, trying to do things that are really difficult late in the day. Five to 6:00 PM is my worst time of day and I know that about myself, so I'm not going to schedule in my most difficult meeting or writing up a strategy deck or something for that period of time because I know that that's not going to be my best and it's actually going to make it more difficult for me to get the work done. Being able to manage my energy levels and figuring out how to schedule my time for my energy has really allowed me also to figure out how to have that abundant mindset in all situations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:50):

(00:07:47):
Today's episode is brought to you by Command AI. If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites where you ask a question and it says something like, "Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product.

(00:08:19):
The AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. Command AI works with web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, LaunchDarkly, and over 25 million end-users interact with Command AI interfaces. To try out Command AI, you can sign up at command.ai/Lenny and experience a custom demo of how it works in your app. That's command.ai/Lenny.

(00:09:06):
I'm going to go in a totally different direction. Before we were recording, we were also chatting about founder mode, and this is recently. This episode we're recording shortly after Paul Graham put out his now classic, instant classic founder mode post. And he had some really interesting takes on ways to think about founder mode, both from product leader perspective, from a founder perspective. So, there's kind of two questions I want to ask, but just broadly, what's your take on founder mode?

Anneka Gupta (00:09:33):
Well, first of all, I think Paul Graham did an amazing thing by putting a name to something so many of us have seen in practice. And while he didn't in his article say this is exactly what this is, I think many, many people that I talked to were like, "Oh yeah, I recognize this." I recognize people that I've worked for, CEOs, that have done founder mode, great founders that have done founder mode poorly. And it opened up a level of discussion that I think is really valuable for everyone to be having, whether you're a founder or you're someone that works for a founder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:04):
Okay, so I'm going to ask two questions around this. One is from the perspective of working for a founder and founder mode, the other is being a product leader in founder mode. So, first of all, imagine you've worked with a few founders that operate in founder mode. As a CPO, as head of product, that's often a difficult place to be between the founder and the team that are building the thing. What have you learned about how to effectively work as a product leader with a founder in founder mode?

Anneka Gupta (00:10:30):
So, I think when a founder's in founder mode and if they're doing it well, what they're doing is really deeply understanding the business and then figuring out when to use their power as a founder to either tweak things and send something in a slightly different direction or fundamentally innovate and completely change directions or completely innovate in a totally new area. Now I think the way to use that effectively as a head of product is to recognize that they have that power to figure out how to use that power to get the things done that you know are best for the company. So, I always think about I have all the people around me. Whether they're people on my team, my peers, or my CEO, these are different resources I have to go get a initiative done or get work done in the company.

(00:11:23):
And as having a founder that can effectively operate in founder mode means that I can go and have a conversation with the CEO and say, "Hey, look, we have this huge opportunity and these are the things that aren't working, and I need your help to help figure out how we can move the needle more substantially in the direction that we need to go." And so activating that founder, that CEO to really be able to push the initiative that I think is best by making them an ally in doing so. I think one aspect. The second aspect is, which often happens, it's very difficult for many people and I've had this happen to me many times, is when a founder is like, "Well, I have this idea," and then you may or may not agree that that's the best direction to go in and how do you navigate that kind of situation?

(00:12:10):
So, one is actually taking a step back and objectively saying, "Well, why are they pushing this?" Maybe it's the wrong mechanism to go actually get done a strategy that's quite important for the company. So having a really deep understanding about why are they asking this, what are they ultimately trying to get at and what is the objective that they're trying to get at and is this the right way to get at it? If the answer is no to that, then you can go have a conversation. If you know what the objective is, you can go have a conversation with that founder and say, "Hey, look, I know this is what you're trying to do, but maybe instead of looking at option A here of how we go about tackling this, we should have explored these three other options instead." And that can help you and help navigate that conversation.

(00:12:53):
Now sometimes it's difficult to even get to that kind of understanding of the objective because someone might be just super set in their ways of, "Hey, I really want to go after this opportunity. It's my pet project." Then you have to decide as a head of product, do I really want to fight this or do I just give in on this, let it go? And also make sure that we get the stuff done that's most important to the company. You have to make that judgment call as a head of product and decide what is really going to make or break the company. What's the hill that I'm going to die on and is this something that I can shift or is this something that is not worth shifting? Of course it comes down to the personality. I've been very fortunate that I've actually had very few of those situations where the founder has been like, "Hey, I really want to go in this direction and I haven't agreed, at least with what we're trying to go after, regardless of the mechanism behind it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:47):
I really love the point you made, especially about how the founder could be this lever to get things done. When you identify something needs to change, the best way to change that is just have the founder go in there, tell everyone, "Hey, we're going to do this thing differently." It's such like a positive spin on how to leverage founder mode where a founder actually has a lot of power to change that other people in the company don't. Okay, so let's go from the other side. So, I was talking to Nikhyl Singhal who runs the Skip, which is a community you're part of about you. And he said that you're a leader who excels in founder mode, that you operate in founder mode a lot. And so as a product leader, what have you learned about just how to think in founder mode, operate in founder mode, leverage that approach to leading teams, leading product teams?

Anneka Gupta (00:14:32):
Yeah, I think it's often easy as a leader to say, "I'm not going to roll up my sleeves and get into the details of the business or ask a lot of detailed questions about the business because you want to empower people and make them successful." What I've found is that understanding the details of the business and asking questions and understanding to the utmost extent you can, what's working, what's not, what are the financial goals of the business? Are we on track to get there? How are we making decisions? Getting into that level of depth is super important, and then you can decide as a leader, what do you want to do with that information? So there's a lot of information that I collect about what's happening in the organization, the decisions that we're making that I don't do anything with at a point in time.

(00:15:20):
That's my choice to make, but I want the information because in understanding the depth and what is happening, I can decide where I actually think I need to go in deep and make either very significant course correction or a small course correction. Then the way that I think about how do I bring my team along for that so they don't feel like I'm coming in and stomping all over the work that they're doing or trying to re-adjudicate a decision, one, is how do I get in there early?

(00:15:51):
One of the tactics I use is I ask people to present their strategies for things that I think we may need to do a course correction on, and I have them come in and then I ask them questions and then I make suggestion. And I'm able to do that in a forum where it doesn't feel like I'm coming in and rewriting the entire strategy, but I'm giving them there an opportunity to present their best thinking and then trying to figure out how do I take that and make that better and make them feel like I'm making it better versus stomping all over and dismissing the work that they've done.

(00:16:23):
I pick a strategic set of areas. So I think about what is most important for the business? What's going to kill the business if we don't get right and what are the biggest opportunities for the business that we need to go after regardless of how difficult it is for us to actually execute on that? By doing that, then at least I have clarity in my mind and I can provide clarity to the team about what is most important and rally the troops around making that stuff happen if that is what is essentially right. And I'll have all the context because I've asked all the questions of why this is right for the business, why is this going to help us with increased margins or get better growth or get into a new persona if that's what we're trying to do as an overall organization.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
So in that example, and I love this tactic, you have your team come in, you ask them, "Tell me what the strategy is for this thing that you're working on." What you've seen work is instead of like, "No, this is broken, this is wrong, this isn't going to work." Your approach is ask questions and hope that they see the flaws or gaps. Is that how-

Anneka Gupta (00:17:24):
Yeah, it's ask questions, but you can't always lead someone somewhere with asking questions. It's also sharing a hypothesis. So I might have a particular hypothesis about the business where I might see something like, "Well, I was talking to security leaders in our customer advisory board recently and I heard this piece of feedback and this is what it made me think about our strategy, what do you think about that?" And then let them say like, "Okay, yeah, actually I see this or maybe I have some follow up questions."

(00:17:54):
It actually opens a whole discussion where I'm still able to provide my perspective and point of view but not completely shut down the discussion. Because what I always worry about is a leader is I'm going to come in and say something, and because I'm one of the more senior people in the room, no one is going to say if they have a concern. And the reality is I'm not always right far from it, but I want to be able to seed an assumption and then have a discussion based on that and then figure out what the right outcome is about what we should do next based on that discussion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):
Speaking of strategy, you shared with me that at one point in your career you got this feedback that you just weren't strategic enough and that that comment led you to research and dig into what does it mean to be strategic, and also just to level up your strategic mindset and the way you think about strategy. What did you end up with recognizing as being strategic? What is that in your work and in your research? And then how did you actually get better at this work of being strategic?

Anneka Gupta (00:18:57):
I got this feedback once in a performance review and then I actually got it as well a few years ago when I was interviewing for head of product roles and I thought I had made a lot of progress on it, but when I reflected back, I think it actually all came back to the same themes. Which was I think when people say "I want someone that's strategic," what they're really saying is "I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product." So that's number one. The second piece is, "I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on."

(00:19:45):
And I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic. If you're really good at articulating the why, but you're only bringing small ideas to the table, then that's not strategic. If you're championing big ideas but you can't articulate the why behind them in a compelling and simple way, then you're not going to be seen as strategic either. So, that's the formula that I've come up with. This is what it means. And so I focused a lot on how do I make sure I do both of these things? How do I champion a few things that a really big ideas that are going to help change the direction of the company, and then how do I articulate that in a simple and compelling why?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:26):
That's such a cool simple way of thinking about this. Is there an example from your work that might illustrate some of this from a project you worked on or a product you built?

Anneka Gupta (00:20:35):
I can take some recent examples. We've been doing a lot of strategic planning for where do we want to be as a company over the next three years, and Rubrik operates in the cybersecurity space. It's a very fast moving landscape. There's a lot of places that we could go as a business, and one of the ways that I've exhibited this, and this is what I recommend to other people too, is sometimes it's really hard to come up with the compelling and simple why behind something and sometimes it's also really hard to come up with a really big idea out of thin air. So these things can be very challenging. The first step that I found as very useful, and I use this tactic every single day in meetings, is just summarization. So, bringing people together, lots of different voices into a room and hearing what they have to say and at various times in the conversation summarizing what people are saying and summarizing what that means in terms of the direction that we could go in.

(00:21:34):
And then that's a checkpoint of saying, "Okay, this is how I've synthesized what is happening. Is this correct or do we actually need to do another turn because we don't all agree with where we're landing here?" That summarization, even though I may not be adding a new idea into that, I found people actually view that as strategy. They view the effective summarization as strategy. So I think that's one element. Then what I've also found is that when I summarize what other people are saying and especially multiple different stakeholders, then I can think about offline and not in the context of right in the meeting, sometimes in the meeting too I guess, is how do I make this idea one click better? It's not about how do you do something radically, radically different, but taking ideas and then making it slightly better, slightly better.

(00:22:25):
When you think about that, especially from an outside-in perspective of what are the customer problems we're trying to solve and how are we going to take this to market, and don't worry about how difficult the technical implementation is going to be, then you start to get to these big ideas that can really be the change agent ideas. So, I've started doing this more and more and I think especially in the past three to six months, and I'm seeing a material difference in terms of the number of big ideas that we're going and pursuing overall as a company and also the quality of the strategic thinking that I can bring to the table, and it's been really exciting and rewarding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:02):
There's so much you're sharing that resonates with other podcast episodes. For example, this idea of just going one click better. I had Roger Martin on the podcast where this book, Playing to Win, which is one of the more popular strategy books, and he has this concept of betterment as a way to work on strategy. A lot of people go huge with a big strategy and vision, and his advice is just find the thing that is the biggest constraint and bottleneck to your business right now and just make it better and that's your next step. And then just keep doing that and you'll end up in a much better place over time, even though it feels like you're just doing one little thing. And so I love this idea of just picking one thing and making it one click better. There's going to be an episode that comes out right before this with Alex Komoroske, and he has this concept of the adjacent possible and it's just find the next thing that's possible and focus on that versus some big lofty thing. So I'm just sharing a bunch of stuff, that's not a question.

Anneka Gupta (00:23:56):
That totally resonates though.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:58):
Okay, okay. Okay, great. And then the summarization idea, I love it. So tactical, basically any PM can do this just in a meeting just like, "Okay, let me just summarize to make sure everyone's on the same page." Funny enough, this is the feedback I get on this podcast and I haven't been doing this in our conversation yet, but I often try to summarize the person's point and everyone's like, "Oh, I love that you do that. That's so helpful." So I totally see the power of that in my experience.

Anneka Gupta (00:24:22):
It also makes people feel heard and especially when you have a lot of diverse voices in the room that may not agree on all things but have valid viewpoints, it helps bring people together and ultimately the diverse perspectives are going to yield better insights and better decisions for the organizations. You want that, but some people shy away from that because it's scary because you have to deal with a lot of conflict and it's a way to kind of move beyond the conflict and get to the heart of an issue, which in my mind, that's what the PM job is all about is getting to the very, very heart of a problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:56):
If someone wants to work on this skill of summarizing as kind of a tactic, can you give just an example of how you would do that? Is there like a phrase to use? Is there words or an example you could give of just like here's how it would look in a meeting?

Anneka Gupta (00:25:10):
Yeah. So, often if there's a lot of discussion going on, sometimes it can be a little hard to insert yourself. I still may insert myself and say, "Hey, let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said." This is what I've heard. I've heard that our customers are having these kinds of challenges. We feel like this is the way that we want to solve these challenges. We have a right to win in this way and therefore we're going to take this action.

(00:25:36):
Is everyone in agreement with that or is there some dissent about whether that's an accurate portrayal of where we've landed with this conversation? That's the way I'll frame it up and again, ending it on a question so that you're not coming in and just being like, "Hey, this is where we're at." But then inviting people to discuss and say "Yes," or "No, I agree with 90% of that or 10% off." And that helps move the conversation forward because sometimes you'll get stuck in these circular discussions that aren't moving forward and you need to figure out a way to move it forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
And then you experience is just doing that makes you look more strategic and gives people the impression you're thinking strategically?

Anneka Gupta (00:26:18):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:19):
Awesome.

Anneka Gupta (00:26:19):
The other way you can do it is if you're in a room with someone and you have a whiteboard is actually summarize on the whiteboard while people are talking and then show your summarized framework or whatever on that. So that's kind of a good way to do it too. If you're having a hard time interrupting the flow of discussion or you don't feel as comfortable thinking on your feet and interrupting and then framing your point of view, you can do that. In Zoom you can also use a chat. I've done that very effectively and said, "I'm not going to interrupt the flow conversation. I'm just going to summarize in Zoom chat this is what I've heard, and this is what I think we're saying in this conversation." And then sometimes that'll get invited back into the broader conversation that's happening live on the Zoom itself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):
That's a much lower stakes way of doing it, and I'm picturing all the PMs listening to this, they're going to start doing this and there's going to be all these summaries now in Zoom chats and everyone will be like, "Oh my God, why is everyone sharing?"

Anneka Gupta (00:27:14):
And then Zoom AI will start just doing it all for you. Then we'll have to think again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):
And then PMs are over and AI replaced us all.

Anneka Gupta (00:27:19):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):
Okay, so then just to close the loop on becoming more strategic, your advice is when someone's like, "Hey, you're not strategic enough. You need to be more strategic." Your insights is the two things to work on is one, be clear on the whys behind the ideas that you're working on and be very crystal clear. People may not be understanding why you're working on the things you want to work on, the things you're pitching. And then two is actually be the person that makes these things happen, not just put a doc out there. If you're not actually achieving them, people are going to think you're not strategic.

Anneka Gupta (00:27:53):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:53):
Awesome. Okay. I want to talk about decision-making. You have a really interesting perspective on how to become a better decision-maker in relation to being kind of a historian, which I love this concept. Talk about that insight.

Anneka Gupta (00:28:07):
Yeah, so I was at my previous company for 11 years, so I kind of ended up becoming the historian. And when I joined Rubrik about three years ago, I came into an organization that had a lot of history that I just didn't know about. So one of the things that I decided to do when I joined the company was to really understand what happened in the past. What were the products that we launched that weren't successful? Why weren't they successful? What was the perspective on the history of how we've decided to develop the things that we did and why? What was the perception of different people in the organization? I tried to construct this past knowledge of what had happened and what were the decisions that were made and why were those decisions made, whether they were good or bad it didn't matter, so that I could better understand how to make decisions going forward and to learn from the mistakes that I didn't personally live through.

(00:29:07):
I think that's the part that's really important about being a historian. You can always be a historian. It doesn't have to be just when you join a company, but even today I'll hear about projects from many years ago that people will bring up and I'll be like, "Tell me about this project. What happened with it? How did we decide to do this?" And just really learn and be curious about it because that gives me more context into, well, what is it that we did poorly and how can we do that better? And also, what is the baggage that people have around trying to do something similar again? Because people always come with their baggage of, oh, this hasn't worked before, so why is it going to work now? And as a product leader, you're obviously putting in place a lot of thoughts and ideas around this is what I want to go achieve and these are the initiatives. And some people are going to come and say, "Well, we've tried that before." Especially you've been at an organization that's been around for a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:56):
I've been that guy. We've done this so many times. It didn't work. Why are we thinking about this again? Okay, so the advice is if you're new to a company especially, just study the past decisions that were made and share them out as a part of that and then as a side effect, it'll help you make better decisions because you'll have this history about what the company has done. I love that. Along the same lines of decision-making, I asked your former colleague Rachel Wolan what to ask you, and she said that your parting advice when she left to join a different company was it's not about making the right decision, it's about making the decision. That's like the things she remembered about you most, that parting advice. Talk about why that is so important and your insight there.

Anneka Gupta (00:30:42):
Very easy to get into analysis paralysis before making a decision and say, "Well, if I just had this one more data point, if I just knew this, then I could make a decision." But the reality is that you were always operating off of imprecise information as a product leader. What I've found is that once you commit to a decision, you actually learn more post committing to that decision about what's going to work and not going to work, and you move out of the hypothetical. And as long as your decision is like 70% right, you can iterate on that 20, 30% in either direction, but if you don't commit, then you don't actually get any new information that is high fidelity and high quality. So, I'm a big believer in making decisions...

(00:31:28):
I know you've had a few guests talk about speed is super important in organizations. Well, I think making decisions quickly and then being able to iterate on them is a form of that. Just make a decision. Don't make it uninformed, but have a strong hypothesis and then just keep testing whether that hypothesis is accurate or not and you'll shift here and there. You might build something that you have to throw away 20% of the work on, but that's okay. It's better than making no decision at all because you won't get any new information if you don't make any decision at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):
As a PM that might be listening to this, feeling like, "Okay, yeah, that sounds great." But then I make a bad decision and then Anneka is going to be like, "You messed up here. You've shipped the wrong thing here. It didn't work." How do you create a culture where people don't feel that and aren't as afraid of making bad decisions and making decisions with 70% of the information?

Anneka Gupta (00:32:19):
I think part of it comes down to making sure there's a strong hypothesis that everyone understands when you're making the decision. Or it might not just be one hypothesis, it might be a series of hypotheses and assumptions that we're making that are informing the decision. So it might be a hypothesis that this segment of customers is going to be willing to pay for this product because it's solving an urgent and important enough need for them that they're going to go do it and this is the evidence we have to find it, but this is also the stuff we don't know.

(00:32:52):
Then along the way, we learn whether that hypothesis is true or not. And so at the end of the day, if something didn't work out, we can go back to the original hypothesis and say, "Well, this is what we learned in this process that our hypothesis was actually not true, and we learned all of this after the fact." I think the way to make a culture of risk taking and people willing to make these bets and go out on a limb is to reward the learning versus the outcome. That's what I try to focus on is if we're constantly learning, it is okay if we make bad decisions, but we learn from them and we get better for next time. Even in making this bad decision, we learn something about our customers or our business that we otherwise wouldn't have learned that we can use in another context.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:40):
First of all, I love that this comes back to your strategic lesson of just if you have a strong why behind something, that's incredibly powerful and people will be confident that you're thinking strategically. Two, I was just at a talk with Zuck. He's being interviewed at the Chase Center, the Acquired Podcast at this whole event, and his main thing that he talked about that he values most in the culture of Facebook is learning faster than anyone else. Shipping stuff that isn't perfect, but just so that you can get one more turn and learn something faster than someone else. So, that super resonates that's Facebook's culture. Is there an example of something you worked on where you did that, where you kind of ship something that you weren't fully confident in and you learn faster?

Anneka Gupta (00:34:26):
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot because anytime you're shipping products, there's so many different things that could go right and wrong. There's a situation where we created a really amazing high value product and we decided not to monetize it, and then we realized after the fact, "Wait, we should have monetized it. So, we're trying to figure out how to package some new capabilities to monetize this thing that we know has a lot of value without taking away what we've already given to existing customers." So that was something we learned along the way that we originally didn't think, oh, we should monetize this, but then we realized that there's actually an avenue to do that after the fact. There's been other things where we've developed a set of capabilities thinking that it will solve for this new persona's problems, but then we misunderstood how easy it was going to be to go sell to that new persona within our own organization. I've made that mistake many times actually.

(00:35:26):
And so now I think now what I've taken from that is really know how you're going to sell something and who's going to do the selling before you actually go build out the product. Because if you don't have that right focus, you may build out the best product and yet it's going to get zero adoption because no one in your organization is ready to sell it. So there's tons of stuff like that where it's like been okay, yeah, we've learned something from this, and it's not all throwaway, it just means that we've got to do something differently for this product and we need to do something differently for our organization going forward.

(00:37:20):
I want to come back to something Rachel also shared with me when asked her what questions to ask you. By the way, first of all, she spent a lot of time raving about how amazing you are first. That was the first set of conversations, and then she came up with a bunch of questions to ask you. And so her other question was about how good you are at navigating very difficult personalities. She showed this quote that she constantly saw you interact with and bring together several leaders who had much higher egos and very disparate points of view who are not informed or thoughtful or as gracious as you were, and she also said you have very low ego. She wanted me just to ask you for what you've learned about how to navigate very difficult personalities and help people align when it's not neatly what they want to do.

Anneka Gupta (00:38:06):
I try to embody the mindset of feeling like and believing that I can work with anyone. I think what I do when I hit a difficult personality and difficult personalities come in all shapes and sizes and forms is I really try to understand what drives that person. What is it that they really care about? Hopefully they care about something deeply about the company and making the company successful. Sometimes they care about their own personal career, how they're showing up, what people view of them. That's fine. I just need to understand what it is that they really care about, and then if I need something from them, what is it that I can do to motivate them to find what I need from them important? And trying to make that match of they have this desire kind of like building a product, they have this desire and how am I going to get them to care about the thing that I want to care about?

(00:39:08):
The other thing I do is instead of feeling like anger or frustration with the person and instead trying to shift that to a mindset of feeling gratitude and a positive emotion about them is I look at them and I ask myself what can I learn? Maybe I don't want to adopt their personality or operate the way that they are operating, but everyone has something that they can teach you, whether it's their communication style or the way they're able to marshal people together, the way they come up with visionary ideas, whatever it may be, trying to study that person and be curious about them, learn from them and then thank them for that and feel the generosity genuinely about what I got from this situation. It's easier to do sometimes than others, but I think it comes back to that abundant mindset. If you can approach it with an abundant mindset, then you can really consciously do this and when you actually learn something, you will feel the gratitude when you recognize that you are able to get something from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):
I love that this connects with your other original piece of advice of just turning something into this is going to be fun. Let's make this fun. And in this case it's like make it great. What can I learn from this person even though they're really annoying me and it's frustrating and don't want anything done? Then your other point of understanding what they want and kind of using that as a way to pull them in your direction, how do you figure out what they want? Do you have any tricks for just like, "Here's how I learn what this person's motivations are and goals are"?

Anneka Gupta (00:40:42):
Talk to other people that have worked with them before and have done so successfully. So that might be people that work for them because if you work for a person like that, you have to figure out and or you're successful working for that person, you probably understand what makes them tick. So that's one, or talk to people that are peers, anything like that to try to understand and build this view of this person that helps me empathize with them and also helps me understand what they may be wanting to get out of a situation and why.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:16):
I love that. Yeah, they don't have to be involved in that. You just ask other people, "What is this person's motivations?" And then the idea is connect what they want with the thing you're trying to achieve. Beautiful. I really love this idea of when you're frustrated by someone just reframing it to like, "I'm grateful I'm going to learn something from this person in our interaction, even though they're making life hard for me." I really love that. Another skill I hear you're really strong at, and this comes from another one of your colleagues, Hema Mohan shared that you're world-class at giving feedback, giving hard feedback, and receiving hard feedback. And so I want to just ask you, what have you learned about how to do this? It's very hard to give hard feedback. That's why it's called hard feedback. So from either direction, what have you learned about receiving hard feedback or giving hard feedback where someone actually hears Zoom doesn't get defensive?

Anneka Gupta (00:42:07):
The answer is so much, I've learned so much from it. So maybe I'll start with receiving feedback. So, on the receiving feedback side, I think it's very natural to feel upset, defensive, all the negative emotions when you first see a piece of negative feedback, whether it's you're reading it in a employee survey or you're receiving it in a one-on-one from a direct report or from a manager or from a peer. And I try to let myself just feel the things that I'm going to feel. Sometimes that's an emotional feeling, sometimes that means I want to step out of the room or it depends on who I'm talking to, but let myself feel the things that I'm going to feel. Then once that's passed, whether that's a few hours or a few days, don't react. Don't try to say, "Oh, I don't believe this." Listen. And then ask myself, okay, well where is this feedback coming from? Why am I getting this feedback?

(00:43:07):
And try to be super curious about it. And that might be going back to the person that gave me the feedback and maybe asking someone that's a peer somewhere in the organization that might have more context and flavor to what the feedback really is, just trying to learn. Then I can decide, do I think this is valid or not? Is this something I should do something about or not? Actually, all feedback I think is valid. People's feelings are valid, but it doesn't mean that you need to do something about all of those things. Going through that process and letting myself ride the emotional wave and not judging myself for that, but then not reacting and letting myself then figure out and come back curious. I think when you come back curious, people then want to give you more feedback because they know that you're listening and that you're hearing what they say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:55):
So the advice is feel it, don't block it off and be like, "No, no, no, no, no, this isn't real." So fully let your body go through the roller coaster of feeling the negative feedback. Sometimes the feedback is just like, "No, this isn't actually a thing." Do you have any just heuristic of like I should actually pay attention to this deeply or just like let me wait for more data points?

Anneka Gupta (00:44:15):
Yeah, I think in product you receive feedback all the time for your organization or for yourself, and you can't make everyone happy. Everyone wants a different thing from product. So I think this comes up quite often where there's a lot of feedback for the organization or for you as a leader and you have to decide what to focus on and what not to focus on. I always try to anchor on, "Well, what is best for the company and what does the company need for me and for my team at this point in time?" There's stuff that is a must-have on that list, and there's stuff that's nice to have. Sometimes there's just too many must-haves to go deal with the nice-to-haves and you have to just be like, well, I know this is a problem, or I know we could be 10% better in this, but it actually doesn't matter as much as fixing these things that are really, really important and are really what's going to help my organization deliver what it needs to for the company and for the business overall.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:13):
In terms of receiving hard feedback, so you shared one example or I shared an example where someone said you weren't strategic enough. Is there another example of receiving hard feedback that you got that you're like, "Ugh, that sucks"? Either earlier in your career or more recently, anything else come to mind?

Anneka Gupta (00:45:26):
I mean all the time. So there's always hard stuff. Well, people will give feedback of, "Oh, I feel like we're not moving fast enough on our roadmap and priorities. We need to be doing more. Why aren't we moving fast?" Or-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:47):
Never heard that one before.

Anneka Gupta (00:45:48):
Never heard that one before, right? Or disparaging the direction that we're taking a certain product because they don't agree with it because a competitor is doing something else, but we've decided for our reasons that we're not going to go follow that path. There's always something that people have negative feedback about and sometimes I'm like, "Okay, this is an eye roll." I understand where they're coming from. I understand why they're giving me this feedback, but I also don't agree that we should change directions because of it. I don't know, some of the things cut deeper than others, but I think people are making personal statements about my team or they're feeling like, "Hey, the product team isn't listening to feedback, or the product team has a bad culture. Anneka isn't listening." Things like that cut deep and are a lot more... I know like physiologically they make me kind of seize up a little bit, but again, then I try to feel the things I'm going to feel and try to understand why are they saying that. Why do they really feel that and what does that mean behaviorally that I have to do differently or my team has to do differently or maybe just two people on my team need to do differently and someone is extrapolating this out to be a much bigger problem than actually is?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:59):
Awesome. Okay, and then we were going to shift to what you've learned about giving hard feedback so that someone actually listens and doesn't just put up a shield and like, "It's not real."

Anneka Gupta (00:47:10):
So I think in giving feedback, you can never fully control how someone else is going to respond to that feedback. All you can control is what you do, your body language and what you say. What I have found is that if I can convey, and I will say this very directly to people, I care so much about you and I'm giving you this feedback because I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to reach the pinnacle of what I know you can accomplish. And you do all of that setup and you don't just hope that they understand that, you actually explicitly say that and you show that in your body language, then it makes the other person much more receptive to hearing whatever you have to say. Then I think the other piece is that you've got to be direct.

(00:47:57):
The worst feedback is the kind of passive-aggressive feedback versus saying directly this is what you are doing or this is how you are being perceived in the organization, and here are the three things that you can do to change the way you're being perceived or to change the outcomes of what you're driving or become more strategic or whatever it is that I'm trying to give feedback on. I do a lot of prep before I give someone a lot of feedback. I really think about how can I frame this in a way that's going to resonate with them that doesn't come across as attacking them, but helps them understand why what they're doing isn't working or is being perceived poorly? And try to give them examples and even examples that I've personally had to go through myself of how I've approached those situations. And let them ask questions and brainstorm with them, be part of the solution versus saying like, "Here's all this feedback, now you go figure out what to do with it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
This reminds me of Radical Candor. Basically make people feel like you care deeply about them, but be very direct about what they can be doing better. Are there phrases or ways that you set up the conversation? You mentioned a few of just like, "I want to help you become the best version of who you could be and what you're capable of." Is there any phrases you find helpful that you come back to often of just a way to start the conversation?

Anneka Gupta (00:49:21):
Yeah, I think what I started with is like, "I care a lot about you. You have a lot of potential. I can see you doing these kinds of things. I can see you getting to where you want to go in your career." Sometimes I even start the conversation by asking them, "What do you want to do? Where do you want to go in your career?" And that will help me frame up which of these things are important. Because honestly, if someone wants to be eventually like a CPO, the feedback I'm going to give to them is very different than if they're like, "Hey, I don't really want to manage people ever. I just want to be the best I see I can ever be." I'm not going to give them the same feedback. And so having that conversation up front also allows them even before I jump into the feedback to give them their perspective of what they want and then I can tailor the conversation more to what they're looking for.

(00:50:04):
I think that has really helped as well make sure that I focus on the things that are going to really matter. During the feedback conversations, I also try to frame things as this is how you're being perceived than you are doing X. Because I think even though it's hard to hear, "Oh, hey, this person doesn't perceive you in the way that you may think," then we can talk about, "Well, what are ways that we can change the perception?" I also think it's important because sometimes people are like if you say, "Hey, I don't think you're X," and then they're like, "Well, yes I am." And if you're saying, "Hey, well this is how other people perceive you including me, but maybe this is not what you are intending," and you actually say that, you're giving them the benefit of the doubt of actually how they're trying to show up is different than how people are perceiving them. You can have a better conversation then around, "Well, what can you do to change that perception?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):
You mentioned I see product managers, and this is a good segue too. You're a big deal, fancy chief product officer person. A lot of people listening to this podcast are early career PMs or trying to get into product. I want to ask a couple of questions along these lines. One is about getting into products. So, interestingly, you got into product the same way I got into product, which is you used to be an engineer and then you moved into product within a company, which is maybe one of the simplest ways to get into product potentially. For people that are trying to break into product management, what advice do you often give them of how they could go about doing it? I know there's never the silver bullet, but what's your advice?

Anneka Gupta (00:51:41):
I definitely think doing it within the same company is a lot easier than trying to switch companies and switch jobs at the same time because when you're within a company, you've already built credibility, hopefully. And if you haven't, then go crush it at your job so you build the credibility. Then you can start to raise your hand, interact with the product team, take on projects and do things that allow you to get some experience and build a relationship with a leader on the product team who then may be willing to take a chance on you to put you into a product role even if you don't have the experience. Especially when you're within the same company, you bring other things to the table. Let's say you're working in customer support, well, you have a huge amount of knowledge about what are the big problems that people are calling up the support team or opening tickets on the support team for, and that is valuable knowledge for being a product manager.

(00:52:33):
You're coming from the sales side, you're coming with a knowledge of how to sell the product, what really resonates, how do you do the objection handling, and that can be a valuable perspective. If you come from the engineering side, but you understand how the product is built and you understand that technical nuances of that well, that can also be a valuable way to enter into the product team. That way, even though you don't have the direct product experience, you're still bringing something to the table where you are going to have to get trained on core product management, but you're not going to have to be totally trained on the business or the technology.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:06):
So is the advice basically get a job in any function, not necessarily any function, but join a company however you can essentially and then push to try to get into the product team in some form?

Anneka Gupta (00:53:19):
Yeah, I think join a product adjacent function, which honestly pretty much every function is product adjacent, because what function does product not engage with, but as closely product adjacent as possible, and then yeah, find your way into the product world from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):
Ideally there's something within the company, there's some program I imagine that does this sort of thing. Some companies have something structured, some are just kind of ad hoc. Is there anything there you're just like should you talk about this in your interview just like, "Hey, I would really love to become product manager someday." Do you have anything along those lines that would help me get into that or not? Or should you not talk?

Anneka Gupta (00:53:52):
Well, I think it depends. For instance, when I joined LiveRamp, which was my previous company as a software engineer, I actually did say in the interview process I want to become a product manager I think. At that point I was still early in my career, I didn't know for sure, but I said that. Now that was a 20-person startup, so it was worth saying it because they didn't really have a product team and I wanted to put it out there that that was something I was interested in growing into.

(00:54:17):
If you're joining a 5000-person company, you're hiring manager is probably not going to receive it well if you're like, "Hey, I'm interviewing for product marketing, but really what I want to do is go into product." So, it just kind of depends on the company and the stage. You have to play that wisely. But I think once you're in a company, then finding a way to make a relationship with the product leader, or if you're in a startup that is really small and they don't have product management, well then you have the opportunity to take on projects for sure that are product management related because no one is doing that work. Really taking initiative to do that so that you can find an inroad into product management.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:57):
Kind of along these lines, you have a really unique perspective on new PMs because you teach product management at Stanford. You've been doing that for a while. I just want to ask you work with a lot of people that are new to product, thinking about getting into product, then get into product. What do you find are the things that new PMs or people getting into product most misunderstand about the role of PM or are most surprised by when they become product managers?

Anneka Gupta (00:55:23):
When we interviewed students as we were designing the class about what they wanted to learn, what was most surprising to me was that students would say, "Well, can you teach me how to use Figma? Can you teach me the tools that product managers are going to have to use?" What was surprising me about that was I don't think it's the tools that you need to learn to be successful. I think what you need to learn to be successful is how to take very ambiguous situations and consistently drive more and more clarity over time. So, it was interesting to see this mismatch between what people said they wanted to learn and what I felt they actually needed to learn.

(00:56:03):
Now, having taught this class for a few years now, I think talking to students who have then left and become product managers, they've seen a lot of this in practice now and I think they understand that, but there is this mismatch of people who haven't been in product management saying they want to go and thinking that they need to learn some tools or process versus the mindset and the skills required to clarify ambiguity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):
Along those lines, I actually saw you somewhere in a talk or maybe something you wrote talk about how creating this class and creating the curriculum helped you crystallize your own thinking on product and helped you crystallize the mental models of becoming a product manager. Is there anything that you recall from that time of like here's something that's really helped me understand about this function and the skill as you were putting together the class?

Anneka Gupta (00:56:51):
Yeah, I know anytime you're teaching something, you have to figure out a way to synthesize it for another audience, and so many of us have learned product management just figuring it out on the job. I don't know if there's a particular framework that I would say came out of that, but what I found very interesting was seeing the questions that people asked in the class and then feeling like, "Oh, I understand how to answer this question. I can provide an example for it." That was super interesting to me because I didn't expect that coming out of the conversation. Yes, there's frameworks we developed to talk about ideation and product discovery and all of that, but I think those are fairly flexible frameworks.

(00:57:33):
What was most enlightening was being able to crystallize the answers to some of these questions, whether it was about how do you interact as a PM effectively with engineering or what happens if the data shows you that it doesn't matter which direction you pick, like there's merits to both ways. How do you actually go about making those decisions? It was very interesting being able to then have those conversations with students and bring in the real life examples. And I found in some situations that actually go back to my own team and share the same answer that I came up with in class, I was like, "Oh, this is actually a valuable thing to share with my team back at my company."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):
Reminds me of the recent chat I had with this guy Alex Komoroske, where he talked about how oftentimes talking with people helps them uncover new insights that he had in his head and then he writes them down as soon as he says something that's really clever in any way. He's like, "Okay, I'm going to remember that now." Coming back to how to become a PM, so you see all these people getting and taking this class want to become product managers. I know they're like Stanford students and people more likely hire Stanford people. But I guess in terms of how they end up becoming PMs, if you were to look at the pie chart of the people that end up getting a PM job, what's the biggest chunk? Is it they join at some other function and then move into product? Do they just join as a junior PM somewhere? How are people actually getting into the PM role in that class?

Anneka Gupta (00:59:00):
Yeah, I think very few are directly going to an established company and becoming a PM directly, so I would say a big chunk of them. Some of them are, but many of those then had PM experience to begin with or had engineering experience and then went to a technical company into a PM role. The vast majority of them are joining product adjacent roles or they're going to small startups where they might be doing product management, might be the first product manager, or they might be doing product management plus plus, chief of staff, something like that where they get to put their hands in product management, but it's a super small company. So I think those have been the two most successful paths to get into product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):
Awesome. That's a really interesting lens into how people actually get into this role. Potentially final question, but we'll see where it goes. I have this recurring segment on this podcast called AI Corner where I try to get a sense of just how people are finding AI tools useful in their work, in their life. So, let me just ask you, is there anything you've found useful in some AI tool in how you work? Like something you found that helps you work more productively, more efficiently, either you or people on your team?

Anneka Gupta (01:00:08):
One way that we're using AI today is summarizing our user research calls. So, that has been really valuable because we're doing all these calls all the time, we're getting a ton of rich insights. Some of those rich insights are related to the specific project that we were doing this call for and some of them aren't. And now we have that summarized and tagged in a way where you can look up any sort of thing that you want around the calls that we've done and it'll find you the call, it'll find you the context, it'll find you the transcript and summarize exactly what we've learned from that call. So we're starting to use that more and more. It's very powerful capability. I definitely think that that kind of summarization of information for PMs is a big unlock for organizations and I think we're still in the very, very early days of AI making a meaningful difference to the way that PMs do their work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:01):
Is there a specific tool that you love to help you with that that you may want to give a shout-out to or is it something you guys built?

Anneka Gupta (01:01:07):
Yeah, we use Dovetail and it's been fantastic. Connects into all of the Zoom calls and everything, it does a great job with summarization, with search, everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):
Awesome. I love it when someone recommends a very awesome sponsor of the podcast. Dovetail is ongoing and excellent sponsor, so I'm really happy to hear that. Amazing. Anneka, is there anything else that you thought you wanted to share or that you want to leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Anneka Gupta (01:01:38):
The mindset that you bring to your work is actually the most important thing over anything else that you can do. And if you are approaching every situation as much as possible with the positive mindset, you can do more than you could ever possibly hope to achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:56):
I'm going to pull on this thread because this is such a powerful point and I think it's easy to just hear that. It's hard to learn to do it. Do you have any advice on just how to build that mindset? Like it connects to many of the things you said: how can this be fun? How can I be grateful to this person that's annoying me and the things that they might teach me? Is there just anything you've done that has helped you build this mindset?

Anneka Gupta (01:02:20):
Journaling is very powerful. So actually growing up I journaled every single day of my life from when I was 13 to when I was 23. And while I cringe to go back to read any of those, I think what it helped me do and build a practice around that I still do today is when I have a lot of thoughts going through my head, especially negative thoughts, just putting them all down on a piece of paper, writing them on my phone and trying to explore why am I feeling this way? Why am I getting triggered? What is it about the situation that's making me feel so strongly?

(01:02:56):
And when I put it down on paper, then it takes this thing that's abstract and things that I'm ruminating on and actually makes it possible for me to break it down and understand, "Well, okay, this is something I may feel, but the why behind it is a little irrational, so let me let this go." I realize that this isn't rational way to think about this. Whereas other things I start to uncover, well, what is it about the situation and what is it that I need to do differently? What's within my control and what is it maybe that I need to go talk to someone about and say, "Hey, I need you to do this differently to be able to make myself feel better and make the situation better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:34):
It's interesting this is another thread that's been coming up a bunch on the podcast recently that when something is bothering you or something is hard, the more you actually listen to that part of yourself and dive into it and explore it and give it a space to share and talk, the less power it gets and the more space is created for the stuff you actually want to take space. It's not what you would expect because usually it's like, "No, shut up, everything's fine." But the more you actually hear that out, the easier things get. So, I love that you share that.

Anneka Gupta (01:04:09):
It's like doing cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself. That's how I think of it. I've never actually done cognitive behavioral therapy, but I've read a lot about it and sometimes when I go through this, I'm asking myself the same questions that I think are asked in those settings.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:26):
Love that. All right, Anneka, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?

Anneka Gupta (01:04:29):
I think that's all I can think of.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Anneka Gupta (01:04:35):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Anneka Gupta (01:04:41):
The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz, such a great book, great again about mindset of how to approach hard things. Second is I'm a huge fantasy sci-fi fan, so I love Brandon Sanderson's books. I highly recommend those to people as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
All I know about him is I saw videos of him after COVID where he just said, "I wrote five new books during COVIID." I was like, "what is going on?"

Anneka Gupta (01:05:03):
He is someone that is at the top of his craft and I admire people so much that are truly the elite in what they do, and he's truly the elite in what he does. He writes a lot about writing, he podcasts a lot about writing. It's pretty impressive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
And he writes fantasy books, is that right?

Anneka Gupta (01:05:18):
He writes fantasy, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:20):
Okay, cool. It feels like a lot of books to read though. I'm just like, "Oh, my God, so many books." Okay, great. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Anneka Gupta (01:05:31):
Again, on the fantasy sci-fi track, I really like Fallout, which is a dystopian show based on a post-apocalyptic, post-nuclear war world. It's very entertaining.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Yeah, it's just very quirky and fun.

Anneka Gupta (01:05:45):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):
And unexpected. Awesome. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?

Anneka Gupta (01:05:53):
My eight-foot iPhone charger. So I have a cord that's very long that allows me to move around the house and do stuff while my phone is charging because my phone is always running out of batteries. So, highly recommend getting a super long charging cord.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:10):
I've got one of those and I know exactly what you mean. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work during life?

Anneka Gupta (01:06:18):
I think it comes back to dealing with lots of different types of people. I really try to remind myself that everyone has something to teach and everyone has something to learn. I think that helps not only think about how you interact with other people, but also combat imposter syndrome because you have something to bring to the table and teach as well as anyone else, no matter what your age is, no matter what your background, and leaning into that and realizing that people can learn from you and you can learn from others in every single situation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):
Final question. I heard that you're a big fan of Isaac Asimov. Do you have a favorite Asimov book, one that you'd think if someone were to explore his canon, they might want to start with?

Anneka Gupta (01:07:01):
I really like the Foundation series, so starting with that is really good. It's a very different style of writing. You kind of have to stick with it, but it's good, I promise.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):
And I'll build on that and say, "Don't watch the show because the show is so different from the book series." I don't know if you've seen it and-

Anneka Gupta (01:07:16):
Yes, I have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:17):
... not nearly as good.

Anneka Gupta (01:07:17):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:18):
I was just like, what is going on? This is not the story.

Anneka Gupta (01:07:20):
Yeah, very different.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:21):
What are they doing? Amazing. Anneka, this has been amazing. We covered so much ground. I feel like this is going to help a lot of people. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow up on things, maybe ask you questions or just check out the stuff you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Anneka Gupta (01:07:38):
You can find me on LinkedIn, follow me, DM me. I would love to connect. The way you can help me is we're actually redesigning our Stanford class right now for PMs, and I would love to hear from you if you don't have any PM experience, what is it that you wish a class could teach you? And that would be super helpful for me as we're redesigning this class. Thanks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:59):
Amazing. And the way they could share that is DM you on LinkedIn or Twitter?

Anneka Gupta (01:08:03):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):
Easy. Amazing. Anneka, thank you so much for being here.

Anneka Gupta (01:08:07):
Thanks for having me.

# Microsoft CPO: If you aren’t prototyping with AI you’re doing it wrong | Aparna Chennapragada

## Transcript

Aparna Chennapragada (00:00:00):
I have a cheesy Chrome extension. Literally whenever I open a new tab, it just says, how can you use AI to do what you're going to do right now?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:06):
How do you see the future of product development being different?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:00:09):
If you're not prototyping and building to see what you want to build, I think you're doing it wrong. It becomes even more important to have that territorial and taste-making at the heart of it because, otherwise, you just have a Frankenstein product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
There's this acronym that you taught me, NLX. What is that?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:00:26):
Natural language interface. NLX is the new UX. Often I hear a product builders say, "Oh, yeah. With AI, the model eats the products." That doesn't mean it's not designed. You and I are having a conversation. It's a podcast. I'll have another conversation at Microsoft and that's a meeting. Conversations also have grammars. They have structures. They have UI elements. They're invisible. What are the new principles, new constructs in natural language as an interface?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
I just saw that Cursor hit 300 million ARR in two years. Interestingly, you guys were very well positioned to do really well in this AI coding tool space. You guys had Copilot, the first tool in the world at this stuff. So ahead of everyone, what happened?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:01:06):
I would say...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):
Today my guest is Aparna Chennapragada. Aparna is chief product officer at Microsoft where she oversees AI product strategy for their productivity tools and their work on agents. Previously, she was chief product officer at Robinhood, vice president at Google, where she worked on Google lens, search, shopping, augmented reality, AI assistant, and a lot more. She was also a long-time engineering leader at Akamai, and on the board of eBay and Capital One.

(00:01:32):
In our conversation, we chat about how working in B2B is like being Jean-Claude Van Damme doing the splits across two moving trucks, how she's operationalizing her team living in the future so that they're building towards where things are going, why people still need to learn to code, why the PM role isn't going anywhere, why NLX is the new UX, and so much more.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:04:35):
Thank you, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:37):
When I asked a lot of people that work with you, what I should ask you about and what I should know about you, something that came up again and again, it's something that I think most people don't know about you, which is that you're big into stand-up comedy, and you take it semi-seriously. Just how serious are you about this? How much of your life is this and most importantly, how does this help you build better products?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:04:59):
It's hard to say I'm serious about a funny business, but I do watch and do stand-up comedy. I do open mics. I've done a few shows.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:09):
Wow.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:05:09):
I have one set brewing that is around AI, unsurprisingly AI and tech and Silicon Valley. It's really interesting for me. This was an accidental discovery. I had always been an SNL fan and Discovery fan, but I went to an open mic because my son sings, and he went to the open mic for singing and he is like, "Mom, you should go do this." And I was like, "Oh, let me go give it a try," and I found that I enjoyed it and was good at it. To your question though, about building better products, I'd say both have PMF, I mean, product market fit, punchline market fit.

(00:05:49):
Actually, there are a couple of things that I do find really powerful and useful because in open mics or even when you're testing these things, it's a very tight cycle of iteration, and you get live... Open mics are the real live experiments. You put something out there, you get very clear micro feedback from users, and then you get tough feedback sometimes. And I think as product builders, that's actually one of the great skills to have, which is you sometimes launch stuff that have a fantastic vision, but the first version is not quite there. And Reid Hoffman says this, "Hey, if you don't launch the first version and are not embedded, you're doing it too slow." Just that gap in closing that, it's good resilience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:30):
Yeah. I never saw these corollaries between these two things. I didn't realize you actually did shows, and you're working on a set. I wasn't going to ask you for a joke, but if you're working on a whole thing about AI, is there something that you can share from that set?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:06:43):
One joke I'd maybe share is people think about these AI chat products as women because you don't know what's going on. It's a black box, and you don't know what they're thinking. There's an entire set around that, but obviously on the flip side too, that they're probably more like men in the sense that they hallucinate a lot. They kind of are not yet reliable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:12):
I'm afraid to laugh with this a little bit. This is great.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:07:16):
And even when they don't know the answer, they make up stuff. They're very confident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:21):
This is good. Where are we going to be seeing the show by the way?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:07:22):
TBD.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:24):
Okay. This is great. Okay, let's get serious again. So you worked at most of your career at a lot of consumer internet companies. You worked at Google, Robinhood, you're on the board of eBay, you're on the board of Capital One. Now, you're at Microsoft. I'm curious just what is most different about working at a company like Microsoft and building product at a company like Microsoft?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:07:46):
I think intellectually I knew that, hey, enterprise, particularly the area that I look at most at Microsoft is focused on enterprise and productivity and transforming companies through AI. And to me, I think two things really strike as very different. One, in fact, I just posted about this the other day saying, in consumer, you're kind of like, "Oh, we have a playbook for make the product work or make the feature work and make it delightful," but I think in the enterprise, you almost have... Every time you think you have one use case, you have really two, which is how do you make sure that the feature works well and there's governance of the feature.

(00:08:25):
If you think about even something as simple as sharing a link to a document, you want it to be easy, frictionless, but at the same time, you want that to be secure and safe and being able to have auditability and all of those things. And often, I find that when you go from a consumer enterprise, you fall into a trap of either disregarding that and say, "Oh, we'll just focus on one side of the house," or overly crippling the user experience side and leaning on the other side. So I think there's an art and science and nuance and playbook there too, so that's one big learning for me. The other learning, and especially in the AI era for me has been about this... I think there's a famous trailer from the 2000s on Van Damme on these two buses [inaudible 00:09:13] splits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:14):
Like doing the splits.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:09:14):
Yeah, doing the splits, exactly. I feel like a lot of the companies, including the tech companies, but certainly the enterprises that I talk to are in these two modes where one hand, this is the most compressed tech cycle that we've ever experienced. It's in the order of weeks and months versus years and decades. If you think about mobile and cloud and internet, and there's just so much happening, the intelligence overhang. On the other hand, there's also humans and habits that... Productivity habits change. It's hard to change and change management through the company is also hard. You don't want to be rash on that. So it's like the future is unevenly distributed but even within the companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:59):
On the second bucket of the bus that Van Damme's riding on of governance and adoption and changing behavior and stuff, is there something you've learned about how to get past that, help that along more?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:10:10):
The thing not to do is hold back folks who are early adopters. I think that's the other one learning. In fact, I think that's one of the reasons why recently... I've been working with folks to say, "Can we have both," which is the longer-term change management, being able to do it in a trusted way, at the same time do this program we are calling Frontier program and roll out cutting edge experimental features. We just built this world's first deep research agent made for work, post-trained for work. And of course, it has all sorts of edges, rough edges, but if there are only adopters in an enterprise or outside, how can we put that in the hands of those folks without insisting that all of the company be completely developing different muscles?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:04):
This program Frontier you're talking about, I wanted to spend a little time on it. So what is the idea? The idea here is people are working in this futuristic environment. How does that actually work?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:11:14):
Yeah, I think the idea is exactly this, which is I want to kind of institutionalize and operationalize my personal model of living one year in the future and say, "What does this..." Imagine a company or a setup like Frontier Consulting Group or Frontier Inc., right? And if you did live in that environment where you had all the AI tools and really advanced deep research intelligence on tap, what are the kinds of questions you'd be asking? What's the kind of work you'd be doing? How would you change how you're going about your work day? So that's the premise and you'd say, "Hey, how does it change an individual?" But also down the lane, we want to think about what does a Frontier team look like. We talk a lot about Frontier labs and models. I think models layer is amazing and obviously that's what empowers all these product building to happen, but I want to push us to think about what does a Frontier product look like? And more importantly, how does a Frontier way of working like? What does a team with three people and tons of compute and AI tools look like?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:20):
So how exactly does this work? There's a team within Microsoft that's like your job is to use all of our latest tools and build product using that. Does that work?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:12:29):
That is the setup. We are just a few weeks into that setup, but meanwhile what we have done is we've actually set up a fake company and said, "Hey, if you are somebody who wants to come play with some of the cutting edge science projects and deep research agents and agents at work, come party here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:51):
Wow. And it's only a few weeks in. Okay, so TBD how it all goes.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:12:54):
Yeah. And again, these are micro... Let's see. The meta point here also is that in the traditional way, we've kind of always thought about across the companies, across industries, really thinking about roll-outs in these macro ways. You build something and you kind of roll it out, you have a general availability for, and then you take the time. And that's really important too because, again, we are talking about pharma companies, legal companies relying on this. So we do want to have that. But at the same time, given the compressed cycles of AI, how do we start to have people experience what's the one year in the future?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
Let's follow this thread in a few different directions. There's how product development changes, there's how engineering changes. There's also just agents. I know you're spending a lot of time in agents, feels like you're not an AI company these days if you're not working on agents or building an agent.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:13:42):
Lenny, you're doing this wrong. You didn't use the word agents so far into the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:51):
I try hard to push it out as far as I can. It's like every conversation in San Francisco, it's just like how long until I start talking about AI? It's like three minutes. Average, I bet. Oh, man. Okay, so with agents, I know that you're leading a lot of this work at Microsoft and a lot of people are wondering what the hell does this mean? What is going to change? Give us just a glimpse into how you see the world being different in a world of agents being around more.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:14:18):
There's a short term and there's a long term, right? There's a lot of hyperventilated, excited talk about the eventual future and all of that. I take a much more practical product building lens on this, and I think about these. At the end of the day, there are tools. Yes, underneath it, there's stochastic models versus very deterministic programming models. You can tell I'm a computer scientist like the way that worldview definitely shapes how I think about this. To me, the short term is there's an evolution. We had apps, and now I think we are firmly in the assistance era where there's human driving the... That's what we think of as co-pilot, right? I think the human driving in the driver's seat but having a lot of assistance from AI.

(00:15:07):
So I think of this as then you look at the dimension of almost autonomy and delegation and intelligence. As the intelligence, for example, when deep reasoning unlock happened, of course, then you can delegate more to the agent. So I think, to me, there's one dimension where you say, "Hey, agents are somewhat independent software processes that can kind of run tasks," and you're not just thinking about handholding and fine motor stuff. You're saying, "Hey, here's my goal. Go make this happen." I'll give you an example. So we are working on this researcher agent for work. And last night, I said, "Hey, I have an important meeting coming up with the leadership team. I really want to present these frameworks here and this is the roadmap here. Go back and look at all the people that are in the meeting. What are their views on this topic and come up with how I should I be thinking about the right persuasion pitch here?"

(00:16:07):
And what's magical about this is not just that it's saving time. Typically, we think about the, so far, AI as summarizing a document or saving time. This is like fighting synapses that I didn't quite have and actually giving me new insights and giving me, dare I say, superpowers. So that's a natural evolution of AI, I would say. So when I think about agents, I think about three things. One is an increasing level of autonomy and kind of independence that you can delegate higher and higher order tasks. Second thing I think of it is complexity. So it's not just a one-shot, "Hey, create this image or do this thing or summarize the document," it's build me this prototype that expresses my idea of, say, an augmented reality app. It's a complex task. And then the third thing I would say is asynchronous. It works when you are not working. I think that's the other big thing about these things that you don't have to sit in front of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:05):
This answers the question of what is an agent essentially, these three bullet points. So what are the three again?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:17:10):
When I think about agents, I think about these three things. So one, it's autonomy like being... And it's a spectrum, it's not a zero-one, it's how do I actually delegate things that it can do. Second, I think of as complexity. It's not a one-shot, "Hey, summarize this document, generate this image, but it's build me this prototype or help me knock this meeting out of the park." And then the third one I think of is it's a much more natural interaction. That doesn't just mean chat, but it may be actually jumping on a meeting with the agent and being able to talk through all of it or point it to things that I wanted done differently. So I think all three things, the autonomy, the complexity, and the natural interaction are at least product principles that will shape really good ones, good agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
That is really helpful. Along this line of agents, there's this acronym that you taught me as we were chatting ahead of this podcast, NLX, what is that and how does that relate to agents and why are people not thinking about this enough?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:18:10):
Oh, that's one of my Roman empires these days. The natural language interface. NLX is the new UX. Here's the deal. To me, I think traditionally we've thought very consciously about GUI because the graphical interfaces are not something natural, and so they have had to be explicitly designed, but they're rigid interfaces. What we have with conversational interface and natural language is it's a much more elastic, right? That doesn't mean it's not designed. Often, I hear a product builders say, "Oh, yeah. With AI, the model leads to the product. So it's just you chat with it." You and I are having a conversation, it's a podcast. I'll have another conversation at Microsoft and that's a meeting.

(00:18:59):
So conversations also have grammars, they have structures, they have UI elements, they're invisible. And so one of the things that I see and I'm really excited about is what are the new principles, new constructs in natural language as an interface? I'll give you a few examples. And actually a lot of startups as well as big companies are really experimenting with this stuff. One is if you think about it, prompt itself is a new construct and that's a new UI element just like a dropdown was or a menu was. But others that are emerging, especially for agents, I think are plans. So when you give a high level goal, what we are seeing is that when the agent comes back with a plan, preferably an editable plan, that's a new construct.

(00:19:44):
The other one that I think about a lot is showing the work, progress. You see this with different products. You see with the Copilot, you see with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, this idea of thinking aloud and it's kind of showing the work, but how much do you do it? If it's too verbose, it feels like I'm running some cron job and scripts, but if it's too terse, then I don't know if it's going in the right path, and I don't have the confidence yet. So there are all these new elements. So if you are a product whittler, this is a fun new space to be digging in for product design.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):
This is really interesting because I think people chat with all these chat bots and it just feels like this is just the way it is, but you actually are designing every element of the interaction, how much to share, but how much you're thinking, here's my plan, what do you think. So I think this will surprise a lot of people, just realizing there's so much that goes into just designing even these what seemingly are simple conversations.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:20:47):
Yeah. Another good example is follow-ups, right? You could say, "Look, you asked me a question," and then I could ask a follow-up set of things, and that's explicitly should be designed for success. So for example, if I said, "Hey, create an image," and it created a black and white like a clip art version of something. What are the next obvious follow-ups that it should be suggesting proactively? Now, too much and you are kind of annoying me, but too little in some sense, you've lost an opportunity to direct me or guide me into a happy path here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:25):
This resonates a lot with when we had Kevin Weil on the podcast, he talked about this question of just how much to show about what you're saying. And it's interesting that DeepSeek went the extreme of just showing everything and people liked it too. I think that was interesting.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:21:39):
Yeah, and I think it's a point in time thing too, Lenny, because in some sense right now these things are such black boxes. They're almost like peeking under the hood for anything. Even if it's verbose feels like, "Oh, I know what's happening," especially because the compute inference time, it's taking long to think. So it just feels like if you just went silent, I'd be very uncomfortable, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:02):
I know.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:22:05):
Exactly. So I do feel like there's that point in time, but over time, I also feel like this is an area ripe for personalization. For example, again in human, my API would be very different from somewhere. My interface is probably different from others, and I might just want the direct, "Hey, give me the TLDR," versus the, "Oh, so I went here and then I went there," and I'm like...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:28):
Following the start a little bit. We're talking about just how the future is going to be different. There's designing for these chat experiences, there's agents, kind of zooming out to just product development in general, it feels like you're at the forefront of a lot of the tools that are going to change the way we build products and also your teams are working with a lot of these tools that no one else has access to. So let me just ask, how do you see the future of product development being different from today most, and what do you think product builders should be preparing for doing to succeed in that future?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:22:59):
I'll start with one stark statement that I say internally and externally, and I am trying to live it is that in this day and age, if you're not prototyping and building to see what you want to build, I think you're doing it wrong. I call it the prompt sets of the new PRDs. I really insist on folks saying if you're building new projects, new features of course come with prototypes and prompt sets. And I think the notion is not to say, "Hey, now everybody's just a biggest version of a software engineer." It is to say you have the fastest path to seeing and experiencing what's in your mind to be able to communicate, right? It's a much more high bandwidth way of communication. I think about that as a really a loop accelerator in terms of product building. That's number one. When in doubt, as someone put it, demos before memos, right? I think that's really number one.

(00:24:04):
I would say number two, this one is a little bit tricky I'd say, is that what I'm seeing is that the time to first demo is much shorter, but the time to a full deployment is going to take longer. So I think that there's going to be an uneven cadence. So typically, I think there was much more of a you've been this thing, you take a few weeks and then you can iterate and so on. But that inner loop of prototyping and iterating and getting even user research through AI conversations, all of that gets shortened. But I think the bar for scale, therefore becomes much high. In some sense, if you look at it, there's going to be a supply of ideas, a massive increase in supply of ideas in prototypes which is great. It raises the floor, but it raises the ceiling as well. In some sense, how do you break out in these times that you have to make sure that this is something that rises above the noise? So I would say that it's simultaneously thinking about not chasing after every idea. I think is the second one.

(00:25:14):
I'd say the third thing is there's a lot of conversation around full stack builders. What does the team of the future look like? A product building team. What I think about is I think that is inevitable in terms of there will be a few folks that are, especially at the prototyping early idea discovery stage that the lines of blurred, there'll be a few taste makers at the same time. I think you can still have a lot of people experimenting. It becomes even more important to have that editorial and taste making in a Frontier, one or a few at the heart of it because otherwise you just have Frankenstein product. That definitely doesn't change.

(00:25:58):
I have one other additional bonus thing, which is a lot of folks think about, "Oh, don't bother studying computer science or the coding is dead," and I just fundamentally disagree. If anything, I think we've always had higher and higher layers of abstraction in programming. We don't program in assembly anymore. Most of us don't even program in C, and then you're kind of higher and higher layers of abstraction. So to me, they will be ways that you will tell the computer what to do, right? It'll just be at a much higher level of abstraction, which is great. It democratizes. There'll be an order of magnitude more software operators. Instead of Cs, maybe we'll have SOs, but that doesn't mean you don't understand computer science and it's a way of thinking and it's a mental model. So I strongly disagree with the whole coding is dead.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:54):
That's awesome. I love that. And SO is a software operator, what is that? What that stands for?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:27:00):
Yeah, I just made it up but yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:04):
Okay, cool. This idea of prototyping as being kind of core to building these days, is there anything you do within Microsoft to operationalize that and make that just a thing everyone has to do? Is it just culturally do it or is it like you must show me a prototype before you show me it.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:27:20):
Again, the future is here, unevenly distributed, even in Microsoft I would say, but there is certainly a strong cultural momentum and shift and desire to say, "Hey, let's actually look at live demos, live prototypes, and to even communicate the ideas. And to me, I mean, it's not always possible because obviously there are things that are deeply... If you're trying to change something in the bowels of Excel, you probably don't. There's even enough depth in the product that what you need to do, and you don't need to prototype that. But if you're especially thinking about new things and new products, new features, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:01):
Okay, let's talk about product management. There's this fear that emerged as soon as all these AI coding tools came out of just like PMs are dead, we don't need PMs. We could just build things ourselves. What are these people hanging around for? And what I found is it's actually the opposite that now that coding is easy. Now, the question is more and more, what should we be building? Why should we be building it? Is this right? Is this the right solution? Then getting adoption for it, which is what PMs are really good at. I feel like it's the opposite. PMs are the most important role. It'll change too, but let me get your take. Just what do you think the future of product management looks like? Do you think it's dead? Do you think it's going to thrive? Do you think it's going to change?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:28:41):
Yes. Look, if you are a TPS report, mostly process person, and a lot of companies do get confused about product management and process and project management, I think then you do have a question of, "Hey, what is the value add here," especially if AI can read and write 50,000 meeting notes and track things and send emails and so on, but what I do think on the flip side is the taste making and the editing function becomes really, really important. In a world where the supply of ideas, supply of prototypes becomes even more like an order of magnitude higher, you'd have to think about what is the editing function here.

(00:29:34):
So that does mean that the bar is higher for product folks, but I think there's an interesting side effect I am observing in startups that I'm advising, companies and even within the companies that there used to be more gatekeeping I would say, in terms of like, "Oh, we should ask the product leader what they think." And again, there is a role for that editing function, but you have to earn it now. You just don't get it because of this title, but there's also just unlock of latent really good ideas from smart engineers, smart user researchers, smart designers who now have this expert in their pocket to kind of round out all the other things that they're not typically skilled at to bring forward their ideas and that's amazing, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
And I think that expert, it's interesting, I'm working with an engineer on some stuff and he uses ChatGPT to even communicate to me in a more effective ways like, "Turn his pitch into something that will convince Lenny, this is a good idea."

Aparna Chennapragada (00:30:39):
By the way, that is actually one of my common use cases, which is the WWXD I call it. What would X do? I use it to say, "Hey, what would Satya think about this particular set of conversations or ideas that we are pitching and so on." This is the power of, I think deep reasoning plus relevant context, right? This engineer you're talking about has that context about you and so it's kind of very interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:06):
If only everyone was as famous as Satya and had so much information out there, but I guess you can import all their emails or whatever tools exist to just understand from the conversations you've had with that person.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:31:17):
Yeah. And I think this goes back to actually what you were saying too, which is I think this idea of what is the... There's like a coil spring. There's an intelligence overhang that I just see across the board. And I think the part of product development has to almost rewire ourselves to, I think, Tobi from Shopify calls it the reflexive AI usage. And that's not as easy, and I've been thinking about why. Basically, I mean, I have a cheesy Chrome extension. Literally whenever I open a new tab, it just says, "How can you use AI to do what you're going to do right now?" It's very cheesy, but it kind of helps to pause and think, "Oh, what am I trying to do here?"

(00:31:56):
But the reason I find it hard, and when I talk even people who are living and breathing in this space, they find it hard is that the updating of the priors is really hard. The models couldn't do some things one year ago. I mean, image generation was full of spellings or reasoning. You just couldn't have deeper and smarter answers. You couldn't do data analysis. So my impression of it from change, trying it a few months ago, that prior needs to be updated. And it's hard to do that, right? You have to do something almost counterintuitive and against the grain to say, "No, no, ignore what you learned about what this can or cannot do." The baby just grew up to be a 15-year-old in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:40):
I think that last point is so important that we've tried these tools over the years. And so far, it hasn't been amazing and then all of a sudden it is, and you kind of don't know that and you've given up almost and things change.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:32:53):
I think that's actually... If you are a product builder listening to it, that's a really interesting arbitrage thing for you. If you can kind of cut against the grain and say, "No, I won't have that scar tissue around." This didn't work a few months ago and keep setting high expectations and demand more of the AI today, I think you can unlock more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):
There's a lot of alpha in doing that.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:33:18):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda.

(00:33:54):
With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy to organize tab. Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day and more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/Lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A .io/Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/Lenny. I'm going to come back to this cheesy plugin, say more about this. So this is a plugin that just lets you put a custom message on every new tab, and you have it say, how can you use AI to do this?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:34:45):
Yeah, it's as cheesy as that. And it's interesting because it works. In the last few weeks alone, I've been doing this experiment to say, "Hey, how much more AI pill can I get?" Both at work and in personal life to say, "When I'm trying to do anything manual, should I be demanding the AI to do this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:08):
That's so cool. Do you know the name of this Chrome extension by any chance otherwise?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:12):
No. No. I built it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:13):
You built a Chrome extension. That's so cool. Okay. Did you use AI to build it?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:20):
Of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):
Wow. Which tool did you use to do that? Some kind of Microsoft tool I imagine.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:25):
Yes. No, actually, it was just like, I mean, I live in GitHub and GitHub Copilot, so I just was like, "Okay, let's go build this Chrome extension."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:33):
Are you releasing this for the general public?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:36):
No, I mean, that's the amazing thing. It took me like 10 minutes to do this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:43):
Okay, let's link to it. Let's get it out there, open source this thing. Okay. You mentioned Satya, I have a question about this. So you're one of the very few people that have worked very closely with both Satya and Sundar at Google. Let me ask you this. How do their leadership styles differ, and is there just a fun story you could share about each of them?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:36:02):
Yeah. I do feel lucky to have a window into these two amazing leaders of this generation. I would say, I mean, again, no surprise as you'd expect from CEOs of multi-trillion dollar market cap tech companies, they are 99.99 percentile in almost every dimension you'd think of intellect, empathy, leadership, product, strategy. There are, of course, flavors of differences. I was the technical advisor for Sundar for the first... At Google and set up the office of the CEO there. And they're, again, a matter of time and context because there's a lot more consumer-oriented focus there. So what I did find Sundar great at it is being really calm and measured and thoughtful in terms of making sure that things have... Dealing with the complex ecosystems.

(00:36:57):
If you think about the phone ecosystem or even the search and publisher and advertiser ecosystem, it's a very complex ecosystem. He was a master at that. He's a master at that. And I think on Satya, I find it amazing the appetite he has for learning and fine tuning his mental models and just the zoom levels that he can operate at. The macro, the strategy, what's the game? Also the micro, "Hey, why are we not..." Here's a specific insight that I saw on Twitter, and you can count on the fact that he's ahead of pretty much everybody else in terms of spotting those early things too. So it's just been learning from the firehose as they put it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
What a cool opportunity to work with two incredible folks. Okay, let's go in a whole different direction. Let me just ask you this question that I've been asking people more and more. What's the most counterintuitive lesson that you've learned about building products that goes against common startup wisdom, common product building wisdom.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:37:57):
I don't know if it's as common as it should be, and it's like a counterintuitive thing, but I've repeatedly learned that when you're doing something new, zero-to-one, the temptation is to kind of think about... It's like that South Park episode. Step one, think about the problem. Step two, question-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:57):
Underpants. I think it's Underpants, step one.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:38:19):
Underpants. Exactly, right? So I do feel like there's a temptation to rush and say to go to scale before solve. So I've always said to my teams solve before scale. So what that does mean is there's a different posture and different mode when you're trying to solve a problem versus scaling something that's either post-product market fit or even at least in roughly in the ballpark. So to give you a couple of examples, I think when you look at the solved stage, there are wide lurches. You got to be very comfortable with the fact that you're day one thinking about, "Hey, a plant detection tool." And then day 15, you're like, "Oh, actually, the tech is really good for translating foreign language." By the way, this is not hypothetical. This is what we kind of looked at in Google Lens back then and said, "Okay, what is the intersection and so on?"

(00:39:17):
So from the outside, it looks like chaos, but actually, in the... And you should be very comfortable... Not only tolerant, I think you should have an appetite for that because the last thing you want is prematurely fix on one local hill. And then you're climbing that in start-ups and entire product areas and companies, big companies make that mistake and three years later you're like, "Oh, how do I get off this hill?" So I'd say that's one big counterintuitive. When you're trying to think about what mode you're in, are you in the solved mode? Are you in the scale mode? One example is kind of making sure that you're comfortable with the chaos. I think the other lesson I've learned is the danger of metrics. And I think again, if you have worked on Google Search or if you worked on Office products, you really have a very fine-grained sense of what are the metrics for this product?

(00:40:11):
You have the input metrics out, you have the whole shebang, but when you're looking at something zero-to-one. If you decide on a metric two prematurely, that's false precision first of all, right? I mean, CTR. When you have a thousand people, it doesn't mean anything. Retention also may not mean anything. So really being very wary of this big guy, big girl of grownup metrics as I call it, right? You are looking for more qualitative, the sound of click, and what is your... The other kind of the handler uses, what is your set timer and play music? So if you look at Alexa and Siri and Google Assistant and all these things, they had a very promising broad interface. You could say anything, but I think there was one or two things that it was really good at. You could set a timer, you could play music, and you could play trivia. And so you've got to nail those things before you say, "Oh yeah, here you can do anything with it," which is not a good recipe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:11):
Not so funny. That's exactly what I use my Google Home for, so basic. I don't do the trivia thing now maybe I got to give this shot.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:41:20):
Got to try that. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:21):
There's something along these lines that I've also seen you talk about, which is how to go zero-to-one with something, just a little framework for helping you know if this is the right time for this idea. How do you think about that?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:41:33):
Yeah. And when you think about the solved mode, and this is again sticking with my whole living in one year in the future, I gravitated towards the zero-to-one and solved mode products completely thinking about new category of products. And what I've found, both the hard way I would say, is that you do want to look for at least two out of these three factors, inflection points here if you want to make a really good product. Number one is there a... Shift is a step function in the tech. That's somewhat obvious I would say. Deep learning was one for Google lens. Back then, speech recognition was a step function for conversational search. I would say for Robinhood, the generational shift was very clearly, and the fact that phones were a primary means for you could actually have mobile app for finance that you could use. So look for that inflection. What is the tech inflection? And right now, of course, like LLMs and reasoning models are that step function, but that's not enough.

(00:42:35):
I would say the second factor that we should look for is, what is the consumer behavior shift? So to give you an example, when we started working on Google Lens, what we said is, "Look, people were taking mostly pictures for sharing, selfies and sunsets and so on. And suddenly, when storage became free, mostly free, and everybody had phones everywhere all the time, you took pictures of everything. And then you had enough of pictures or you use the camera as the keyboard for your world, for the real world. And so how do you then say, "Oh, this consumer shift is big, and so therefore, as you go order of magnitude more photos, then you want more to come out of them and you can apply AI to that."

(00:43:24):
And I'd say the third inflection point, particularly I would say in enterprise but also in consumer, is the business model shift. Is there an inflection natural inflection point in the business model? So any great products, if you think about all the way from search, again, the second price option and the fact that you had CPCs, same thing with SaaS and the fact that you could actually charge or monetize enterprise products in a different way. And with AI, of course the monetization is a whole different... We've just barely scratched the surface of whether you do seat monetization, usage like on tap, and then of course outcome-based stuff, outcome-based monetization. Hey, have you solved the problem for me and then I will pay you some fees. So all three to me are kind of like, great, but at least two out of three for a good product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:21):
So this essentially... When investors look at startups, they're always asking, why now? Why is this the time to start this thing? And so your advice here is there's three ways to look at it. Two of these three should be true. There should be a shift in technology, some new technology that has enabled this now recently. There's a shift in consumer behavior, and then there's maybe a new sort of... Or you've invented a new business model, any way to monetize something that it gives you an advantage over folks trying to do it today.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:44:51):
Yep, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:52):
Awesome. You did mention Robinhood, I think in that example. That was another good example of phones-

Aparna Chennapragada (00:44:56):
Yeah, I mean, talk about the business model of, again, not having a zero fees. And again, that combination of all of these things is what can unlock it. You can't just say, "Oh, we'll just have a much more better intuitive interface and hope that people will switch to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:16):
Okay, so speaking of zero-to-one products, I'm going to take us to a occasional segment on this podcast that I call Hot Seat Corner. And I have a question for you that is on my mind and it's come up in a couple recent podcasts actually. So there's these companies like Cursor, VZero, Lovable, Bolt, Replit that are the fastest growing company's history. I just saw that Cursor hit 300 million ARR in two years. Interestingly, you guys were very well positioned to do really well in this space, this AI coding tool space. You guys had Copilot, the first tool in the world at this stuff, so ahead of everyone. You build VS Code, which is what all these companies are forking to build on. You have incredible AI infrastructure, incredible AI talent. So this could have been your market. What happened? What happened, Aparna?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:46:01):
It's interesting, the framing... So I'm a dead user of GitHub Copilot, and I would say, "Look, if you unpack..." I think the beauty of this is that code generation has become an amazing tool that LLMs have unlocked. So it is actually really good excitement and action that now code generation has just opened up all of these things that... We talked about the whole idea of prototyping, goes from idea to marks and idea to a clickable prototype in a few minutes. Those are the kinds of things that, of course, we should expect code generation to enable. The way I think about how we are positioned and what we do with GitHub is... So it's a system, not just a product or a set of features.

(00:46:52):
If I think about GitHub, it's for folks who have the repo there and you have... Of course, you have the assistance in terms of autocomplete and you can chat, but now we have the agent board. It's one of the fastest loops that we are seeing, really strong positive feedback. So in some sense, when you have a system, what you are looking for in terms of building and designing it is not just a single product that can grow, but what is the repository? What is your context? What are the set of features that grow from your expertise? If you're a really expert coder, you want the assistance this product needs to scale for that. If you're a wide coder, you should still be able to do that and so on. So that I think is the way that GitHub is positioned to build on and growing honestly really well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:46):
That's so interesting. So the core of this is everyone ends up in GitHub anyway, no matter what tool they use and that's kind of the-

Aparna Chennapragada (00:47:53):
Yeah. The idea again is that code generation as a tool will unlock lot more products. I mean, they're not all competitors to the fact of... They're not all kind of doing the same job. I think when you are... At the end of the day, you are building code for companies to run on, you need to have a system. You need to have kind of the ability, an entire Swiss Army toolkit, not just the autocomplete, not just a chat, not just like a software agent that runs and you kind of hand hold. You need all of this to work together, and that's what the GitHub product is going after.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:30):
All roads lead to GitHub. On the flip side of this question, there have been probably 5,000 startups that have tried to disrupt Excel and you guys just keep winning, so something there is working really well.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:48:46):
That is so interesting you say that. So when I came to Microsoft, and I'm an Excel fan, so I actually had a conversation with one of the OG Excel product folks. I was like, "an, what is it about this product?" And he said a couple things that were really interesting for me that just stuck with me. One is and I said, "Hey, Excel is a proof that non-coders also have to program." Programming is really powerful and it's the tool that gives all of the non-coders a really powerful programming ability, and I thought that was just really striking.

(00:49:22):
And then the second thing that I found out super cool, I don't know if you know this, but I didn't know at least before two years ago that there are these amazing Excel championships like World Excel championships where you see folks who can do just magic. And to me, I think the insight here is also that some tools are harder to learn. Perhaps in the beginning there's friction in terms of learning, but great to use. So it's a very good case of, hey, the learning curve initially, the one-time learning curve might be tricky, but it is because there's so much power and depth in the tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:02):
That's so interesting. I never thought of Excel as a programming language, but it makes sense and I feel like once you get used to it and this is just the way things work, you're kind of stuck there and everything else has to basically copy that model, which is hard to be as good.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:50:13):
Yeah. And I think the depth then the attention that the team has given, and again, that's the compounding effect over decades of working on deep, deep signal from people who depend on it day in and day out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:29):
Okay. To kind of start to close out our conversation, I want to ask this question around your career. I find that most people have one moment in their career that changes the trajectory of their career. It could be a manager they had, it could be a project they worked on, it could be just the job they landed. What would you say is the most pivotal moment in your career that eventually led you to becoming chief product officer at Microsoft?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:50:54):
Actually, there is one moment where it was a turning point for me. I was in Google Search, I was working on this idea that I thought should just work and it didn't. I said, "Hey, these phones are becoming a thing. Personalization has to be important." So I probably banged my head against the wall for a year or so trying to make personalization work. And it turns out when you have a query that you put into Google Search, the personalization didn't matter as much. And so we disbanded the team, but then I think I started working on this product called Google Now, which was a twist on that, which said, "Hey, actually on the phone, we should be able to push content. It's not about searching with personalization." For example, if you have a flight coming up, we should be able to say, "Hey," connect the dots and say, "you should leave now given the traffic and where you need to go," and so on or if you're deeply interested in stand-up comedy with deadpan artists, you should check out Mitch Hedberg.

(00:52:00):
These are kind of these really moments that the smartphone should be smarter. So I let that product through the initial zero-to-one phase, and that was a pivotal moment. It made me realize two things. One, I really love seeing around the corner and kind of seeing where things go and building the product rise to the occasion way more than the scaling and sustaining products. Second, it's harsh, but being early is the same as being wrong. This is pre-LLMs, pre-deep learning a lot of the really amazing ideas in terms of next token predictor, et cetera. We'd been thinking of it but didn't have the horsepower to go... The interface was great, the intelligence wasn't there. And I'd say the third thing that stuck with me is I got to work with some really smart... They talk about talent density now, and I think really smart people who have gone on to do amazing things, and so it gave me a taste of what a small group of people can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
It's such a great story because it didn't work out in the end. Google Now kind of went away. And by the way, I super remember that product. It was very cool. I remember looking at it was very delightful and happy. And so I also have this segment on the podcast called Failure Corner, where people share a story of failure and how that helped them. And I love this as a combination of those two.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:53:20):
Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to lie. I think it was painful when you do that because you see the vision of what can be and what is, and sometimes it's hard limitations. Sometimes, in this case, it takes five years or 10 years to really unlock the intelligence, but sometimes it's one or two key click stops away from the product being great and part of figuring out is knowing when you're in what situation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:50):
How long was that period from starting out until just moving on and it's not working?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:53:54):
Yeah, I would say in that case, one of the good things is, again, it led the foundation of... It was one of the foundations of the Google Assistant. And of course, as the LLMs step function happened now with Gemini, it kind of works out. And I think it's the same thing across the board, which is sometimes you want to figure out the invariance that do work that then go on to the next version of the product. And other times, you just have to start over.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:26):
Is Google Now the first agent before agents? That's what it feels like.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:54:27):
That was certainly the idea, but it is fascinating to me that the interface, that there, we had the opposite problem. Whether you think about all the voice assistants, the interface is like we overshot and the intelligence wasn't there. Today, I feel like there's an opposite problem. I think these things have amazing intelligence and the interface we have largely is like the AOL Dial-Up Modem Chatbot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:55):
We've covered a lot of ground. Is there anything that you wanted to chat about or leave listeners with, maybe a last nugget of wisdom before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:55:06):
I think I would say one thing that I'm really excited about is this idea of figuring out how we as people and agents collaborate together. I think there's some great set of products and experiences to be reimagined. That's my other Roman empire, which is how do we actually have this co-working space where you have the humans and agents and how do you actually have an output that's much, much more significant than what any one of us or any few of us can produce?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:40):
Well, I need to hear more about this. When do you imagine a co-working space of humans and agents? What does this look like? Is this Microsoft teams or is this a physical place with little robots?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:55:51):
Oh, I had a thought of the physical place, but I am thinking a lot about... Right now, all of these experiences are very civil player, and I do think there's an opportunity to think about how do we... Again, I'm living one year in the future, how do we actually have collaborate with each other, but also with agents and really figure out, for example, what tasks can we delegate? What can we inspect? How do we actually have information that flows between people that agents can mediate, and so on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:24):
All right, I'm curious to see what you guys got cooking. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:56:32):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Let's do it. First question, what two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:56:38):
Oh, I have recency bias, but I've been reading this book called The Brief History of Intelligence, phenomenal book and like lots of underlining from me. And I think it kind of... The premises too, it looks at the evolution of intelligence like human intelligence and the brain development and connects that to what we are seeing with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:02):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:57:05):
Hacks. I've been watching this. It's about a woman who's a great standup comedian of... I think it's set in the fact that she grew up in the '70s and '80s and really tried to break through in an industry that hasn't traditionally been very friendly to women, so really fun and quirky.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love, could be an app, could be some physical?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:57:36):
I do use a lot of Microsoft products, GitHub Copilot being one of them, but I think the one that maybe I'll pick is Granola, I think, is the name of the app. I found it really useful. I just gave it a spin the other day and I'm like, "Oh, this is really useful in terms of being able to, again, without being intrusive, just capture the thoughts, notes, and structure it, put some..." It felt like one of those things where, yep, the confidence of a few things like we were talking about like the transcription, real-time transcription tech has gotten really good. Voice recognition is great, and then enough of the LLM magic on top of it to make it structured and contextual.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:18):
I am a huge fan of Granola. I'll give a quick picture here. If you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter, you get a year free of Granola for your entire company.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:58:28):
Did not know that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:29):
There we go, and then just check that out, lennysnewsletter.com, and you click the word bundle and you'll see how to do that.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:58:29):
Very cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):
Very cool. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to when you're dealing with something maybe you share with folks that they find useful as well in work or in life?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:58:46):
I have one. In fact, actually, this is my email signature for, I don't know, for the last 20 years or so. It says the best way to predict the future is to invent it. I think it's a quote by Alan Kay. I find it useful for two things. One is no one knows anything. When you think about all the folks who think about, "Hey, this is exactly how everything's going to look and this is exactly the sequence," and so on, I think there's no substitute to experientially building it. I think the second part is if you think there's something that should exist, go build it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):
I love that. Final question. We've talked about standup comedy a bit. Is there a favorite under the radar standup comedian that you think people should go check out?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:59:34):
Oh, there's a couple of them. So one, I think, there's an Indian American or I think a British Indian standup comedian. Her name is Sindhu Vee, super smart, mom comedy, and I think the other one that... This is definitely not under the radar, but I just love his stick is Nate Bargatze. He's just so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:59):
Aparna, this was amazing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out maybe and follow up on anything you shared and how can listeners be useful to you?

Aparna Chennapragada (01:00:08):
You can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter. Aparna CD is the handle. I do post stuff a lot more on LinkedIn these days, so would love to hear thoughts, comments, conversations there. I'd say one thing that would be super interesting is if any of this stuff spark conversations, particularly around this, what can a small team with a lot of AI tools do or new products that folks are really excited about, saying that they should exist, hit me up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):
Amazing. Aparna, thank you so much for being here.

Aparna Chennapragada (01:00:45):

## Transcript

April Dunford (00:00:00):
40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it." Because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:00:39):
Today. My guest is April Dunford. April is the world's foremost authority on product positioning. She's the author of the bestselling book, Obviously Awesome, which is my favorite book on positioning. And this is her second time on the podcast because she just published a new book called Sales Pitch, which builds on her 25-year career as VP of marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games and many others. The book guides you through a better way to pitch and sell your product. And in our conversation, April shares the framework that she has seen work most often in getting potential customers to get excited about your product and to decide to buy your product.

(00:01:16):
Like I say, at the top of this episode, you'll become better at pitching and selling your product by the end of this episode. And if that's useful to you, which it should be, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you April Dunford after a short word from our sponsors.

Speaker 1 (00:01:32):
This episode is brought to you by Composer, the AI powered trading platform now with retirement accounts. Algorithmic trading has historically been reserved for the hedge fund elite. Now with Composer, you can automate your trading with a library of over 1000 strategies that are easy to understand and tweak using an AI assistant and visual editor. Composer is the first ever algorithmic trading platform where you don't need any coding experience. It includes a full range of trading indicators for you to get creative and a Discord community of 2,500 traders to discuss your ideas with.

(00:02:06):
Composer also has a powerful back tester to see the historical performance of your strategies, and you can then invest with a single click. Once you invest, Composer will automatically trade for you based on the logic of your strategy. With $1 billion in trading volume and over 1 million trades executed, composer already has many big time investors using the platform regularly.

(00:02:26):
Head to composer.trade and use the code Lenny for an extra week of free trial on your composer membership. That's composer.trade. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, click up, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:03:04):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:03:47):
April, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast.

April Dunford (00:03:52):
So great to be back. We were talking about this earlier, but it feels like it was so long ago when I did the last one. I was one of the first guests and I feel like, man, you've been running this thing forever. And that was like a year ago.

Lenny (00:04:05):
It feels like a lifetime, but it was about a year ago.

April Dunford (00:04:08):
But what you've done with it is amazing, right? The growth in it, everything else, it's super inspirational.

Lenny (00:04:13):
Thanks April. I appreciate that.

April Dunford (00:04:15):
You're welcome. It's true though. I think everybody looks at your stuff and goes, "What the heck? How does he do it?"

Lenny (00:04:22):
The secret is a lot of work.

April Dunford (00:04:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:04:24):
That's the get rich quick scheme there.

April Dunford (00:04:28):
Nobody wants to hear that.

Lenny (00:04:30):
Yeah. But it's work that's extremely fulfilling and we get to chat again and you are a very rare return guest, which makes me very happy. And the reason you're back is you've written an incredible new book, which I have right here if you're on YouTube called Sales Pitch.

April Dunford (00:04:44):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:04:45):
There it is. And it's in your background, too. It's like a inception. The book is called Sales Pitch, How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win. And we're going to be spending our time today digging into all of the lessons and frameworks in the book as much as we can in the hour that we have. And my goal for this conversation is for listeners to leave this podcast with better skills at pitching and selling their product. Which I think every product leader and founder will want to do and get better at. How does that sound?

April Dunford (00:05:13):
That sounds great.

Lenny (00:05:14):
Okay, sweet. I was thinking as a way to get into the conversation, we start with maybe a story or an example of a company that you worked with where you applied the frameworks and lessons they teach in the book. And then use that as kind of a jumping off point for digging in further.

April Dunford (00:05:30):
Yeah, sure. So my background is, I do positioning work. And so in the work that I do with clients, generally what we're working on is a shift in the positioning, which is a little bit of a shift in our thinking around, how do we win in the market? So in order to test that positioning, what we want to do is take the positioning and translate it into a sales pitch and then test it live with prospects.

(00:05:53):
And one of the things I noticed right at the beginning of doing this work is that everybody's sales pitch kind of looked the same and they weren't all that great. And for the most part what was happening in the sales pitch is there was no positioning going on in the sales pitch at all. The sales pitch was essentially a product exposition, so essentially a glorified product box room. If there was five dropdown menus, we're going to click on all five dropdown menus and show everybody everything just feature, feature, feature, feature, feature.

(00:06:24):
And so, most of the teams weren't used to doing any kind of pitching in the pitch really. It was just the facts Jack, were just going to show you that. Some would do this really lightweight thing. Here's the problem, we're the solution. Now let me walk you through all the dropdown menus, but it is basically the same thing like that.

(00:06:43):
And so what I wanted to do was build a pitch structure that would reflect the positioning. And so in order to do that, we have to get a little bit into storytelling mode. Not a lot, but at least a little. And when we're talking about features, we shouldn't be talking about features. We should be talking about the value that the features deliver.

(00:07:01):
So let me give you an example and I'll do before and after what this would look like. So I work with these folks, Help Scout, and so they're in the customer service space, so think Zendesk or whatever. They're in that space. And what's interesting about them is they were built from the ground up to serve digital businesses. So businesses that don't have a physical store, they don't have sales reps. And so their approach to customer service was different from the outset. Help Scout said, "Well, you know what? Customer service for that kind of business is really important. It's the only time you ever get to interact with actual customers." And so the data shows that if you give them a really great interaction in service, it improves loyalty, it improves repeat purchases, and it's actually a growth driver. Now, most folks in other industries see customer service as a cost center.

(00:07:49):
So your telephone company for example, wants to get you off the phone as fast as possible. And they want to push you to the self-serve FAQ channels, and they don't care about giving you a good service at all. They don't care about any of that. And so they're all about driving the cost down. So if we look at Help Scout in their positioning, the alternatives to Help Scout are a handful of things. Most folks start using a shared inbox and it's really easy to use and the reps love it. It's easy to use. The problem is, is you start growing and then you want customer service features. You want to be able to do assignments and prioritization and things like that. So then these customers end up upgrading to help desk software and now they're in this whole different world.

(00:08:31):
So the first thing is really hard to use. So we're not in shared inbox territory anymore. And the second thing is that there's this attitude of we're trying to push folks to low cost channels. We don't really care about them. We're going to assign you a ticket number. You're not a person anymore. All this stuff. So that's the situation. So Help Scout, if they did a typical pitch the way I see most SaaS companies pitch, they would just expose the features. Right? So the pitch would look like this. Digital business comes in and they say, "Hi, Help Scout, let me show you how to log in, let me show you all the features. Look, there's a shared inbox thing there that's really great. Oh, look, we can do assignments and prioritization and we can do this other thing and we can do this other thing and la, la la." And I keep going until the time runs out and I don't have any more features to talk about.

(00:09:20):
The problem with that pitch is the customer's sitting there going, "I don't know, man, that sounds a little bit like my shared inbox, but it also sounds like help desk software. Is it different than help desk software? I'm not so sure. And there's overlap in the features there." And so it doesn't really answer the question, why pick us over the other guys?

(00:09:42):
And so a different style of pitch would be one, we would do a little bit of setup to give everybody an idea about how we fit amongst all the other solutions and what our point of view is in the market. And then when we get to exploring the features, we would do that within the context of the differentiated value. So here's how that pitch would look like. Customer comes in and Help Scout says, "Hey, digital business, we work with a lot of companies like you, and I'm going to show you the product. But before we get there, one of the things we think is interesting is that digital businesses look at customer service differently. They look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center. And so most of the folks we work with see delivering a really amazing experience as a key part of customer service. Would you agree with that?"

(00:10:26):
Yeah, we would. They have a little conversation and then they say, "Great. We you have choices here. So most of the folks we work with start with a shared inbox, and that's great because it's really easy, really easy to use all that stuff. The problem is if you're growing and you probably are, then you're going to outgrow that because you're going to need prioritizations assignments, help desk stuff.

(00:10:45):
And so then your option is to go to help desk software. And so help desk software is great, does all the things. The problem is that it was not designed for businesses like you. It was designed for businesses that want to take the cost out of customer service. So it's going to do some things that are weird. It's going assign your customers a ticket number and it's going to try to drive them to low cost channels. So can we agree that in a perfect world for digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk, but had all the bells and whistles so we wouldn't have to migrate to something else. And on top of that was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service. Do we agree we want that?"

(00:11:26):
Now, at that point, the customer is either with you or you're not. But if they are, then we switch to the actual demo part. If we do a demo and then we say, "Great, we've got those three things. Let me show you how that works. So one as easy to use an inbox. Look, here's the inbox. It's easy to use. Looks just like an inbox. It's amazing. Two, features, so you never have to outgrow it. Look, here's how we do prioritizations assignments, whatever. We can do all the stuff you need as you grow, and you're never going to have to switch platforms. And then last one, deliver an amazing experience. Look, the customer gets to choose which channel that they interact with you with. And look, they get to stay Dave and not ticket number 1479."

(00:12:02):
That sort of thing. So that's how the pitch looks in the after. But that's a really different pitch. That pitch is designed to answer the question, "Why pick us over the other folks?" And so as you might imagine, it is a lot more effective at actually getting clients to get their head around, what is this thing? Why is it different? Why should I pick you? And it just works way better in a sales situation.

Lenny (00:12:22):
Awesome. So just to maybe summarize the framework 'cause you went through each of these pieces, and I think it might be helpful to give people the kind of steps. And I have them here, but maybe it might be better for you to kind work through.

April Dunford (00:12:33):
So you can think of it is... So first of all, the pitch structure has two big pieces. So the first is the setup. The setup piece is not about us, it's about the market, our point of view on the market. The second bit is all about our differentiated value. So why pick us over the other guys? So those pieces aren't equal. In a normal sales pitch situation, we don't want to spend all day in the setup part. We want to get to the meat, which is our differentiated value, but we can't skip that bit. So if I've got a half hour call or a 45-minute call, maybe I spend a few minutes on this upfront, this upfront stuff is really important though.

(00:13:12):
And we could break the upfront into three pieces. So it starts with our insight into the market. So you can think of this as our point of view on the market or kind of like the problem inside the problem, in some ways. So in Help Scout's case, the insight is, " Hey, customer service is just different for digital businesses, and this is really a growth driver, not a cost center. So we need to think about customer service in a different way." That's their insight. So we start with that.

(00:13:41):
The second piece is pluses and minuses of alternative solutions. What we want to do is paint a picture of the entire market and talk about what's good and bad of the other ways of approaching the job. And then out of that conversation, we have a conclusion, which is what I call perfect world. But just kind of like can we agree that if we really wanted to solve this problem and knowing what works and doesn't work in the alternate solutions, can we agree really good solutions should tick these boxes? This is getting the customer aligned with your worldview.

(00:14:14):
If they're aligned, then we switch to the follow through. The follow through has a handful of steps, but the main step is this differentiated value step. So usually what we'd start with is an introduction. "Hey, we're Help Scout. We do customer service stuff specifically for digital businesses." And then we would move on to, "Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it."

(00:14:37):
We generally end the sales pitch with a couple of little steps. So one is after we talk about the value, generally there's a step for proof, which is how can we prove that we do what we say we could do. Which is often a customer case study or it might be independent third party verification on stuff. But usually there's a proof step. There's an optional step after that, which is handling objections that haven't come up during the call. So sometimes we'll have a silent objection, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it sounds really hard to adopt." Or, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it's probably pretty expensive." Or, "Yeah, that's okay, but it probably doesn't meet our needs for security or whatever."

(00:15:15):
And so we handle that at the end in this special objection step. And then we end the pitch with what I call the ask, which is whatever we want the customer to do next. So it could be just asking for the sale or it could be, "Hey, we want to do a proof of concept. Who do we need to talk to about that?" Or, "Hey, we're going to do a project. Who needs to be involved in defining the project?" Whatever the next step is in your sales process. That's how we end is with dask.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Cool. I wanted to actually talk about objections. 'Cause I imagine going through this, companies often don't agree with what you're saying, and I wonder how you handle that. So you're going in this, do you agree? And yeah, the silent objection is really interesting. I don't even think about that, where they're just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we agree." But they don't really agree. How would you suggest people handle them being like, "No, I don't actually see the world that way." Or the silent objection, which I guess is something you save for the end.

April Dunford (00:16:09):
Typically when we're starting with insight, our insight into the market, if we're doing this well, the insight is generally not all that controversial. So you could think of it this way. So it's kind of the reason you built what you built. So most founders, when you talk to them, they didn't just come up with the idea out of nowhere. They woke up in the morning and said, "You know what sucks about email, this thing sucks about email. And so I'm going to build this different kind of email that solves that problem." Or in the case of Help Scout, it's like, do you know what sucks about customer service? It just wasn't built for these kinds of businesses.

(00:16:44):
And so if you've got a point of view on the world and you're talking to a customer that just fundamentally doesn't agree with that... In the case of a Help Scout, they come in and they say, "No, actually it's a cost center for us. We're just trying to get the cost down." They should disqualify that deal because they can't serve that customer better than Zendesk does. Zendesk is going to win that deal. But if you've done this properly, your insight should resonate for the target account that you're trying to go after. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be other objections, and usually there's all kinds of other objections. But the objections are more on a level of, if I can get you hooked at the beginning in this setup, then we go to the value, which is just proving I can do what we already agreed we wanted to get done. Then the objections tend to be more like operational stuff. "Yeah, this sounds good, but I don't know if we can forward it." Or "This sounds good, but boy, we're going to have to migrate off the old thing or whatever."

(00:17:40):
So mentally they're kind of sold already, but they're worried about, "Well, what's IT going to say? And can I actually get budget about this?" And in B2B, we've got this network of people that we've got to go get agreement from to move forward on this thing. And so often there's objections around that. The beginning of the sales pitch thing... One more thing on that is that part of what we're doing in that setup is what salespeople would call discovery. And so that setup part should not be me talking at you. It should be a conversation between me and the client saying, "Do you agree with this? Is this what you're seeing? Did you start with a shared inbox? What are you doing right now? Did you ever consider using help desk software? Why yes, why no? Do you have any constraints on what you're looking at? What have you tried before? What are you looking at trying right now?"

(00:18:31):
This is part of the discovery that we do in a first substantive sales call that your sales reps would know how to do this. Typically, one of the things we don't have in the pitch decks that I see in SaaS companies is there's no good place to do this discovery. So it kind of happens outside of the structure of the pitch. In this pitch structure, there's a definite spot for discovery. So by the time we get to the end of the setup, we should either be aligned like, "Yep, this looks like a good prospect for us. Yep, we can do something. Yep, they got a problem we can solve. This all looks good." Or we kind of jointly come to the conclusion, "Hey, this just... Our stuff just ain't for you, man." And that's it.

Lenny (00:19:13):
I mentioned a lot of this comes from doing this enough times. You get to understand where people generally agree, this is a problem. We all know this is our problem. And it's unlikely that you're going to have to throw everything out because someone just decides, "No, this isn't for us."

(00:19:29):
I think one of the biggest shift maybe from this framework is that you go into a teaching mindset. It's not just like, "Here's our product, it's going to solve your problem." It's more, "Here's what's happening broadly. Maybe you don't have the time to do the research we've done. Here's what we found." And then that builds trust, I think in you as a company and as a leader, a salesperson. And then they're like, "Okay, see, they see the world the way we do." Or, "I've just realized something new. I never thought of it that way." And then, "Okay, cool. How do they think about the solution to this?"

April Dunford (00:19:57):
Right. One of the key things to think about in all of this stuff that I think we don't think about enough as software vendors is that customers will come to us and they've done their homework. They've Googled around and they've looked at stuff, but that doesn't mean they have perfect understanding of the market. In fact, it's usually far from it. If we think about it, most of the folks in B2B software, most of the time, your buyer has never purchased software like yours before. This is the first time they've done it. And their bosses come to them and said, "Hey, figure this out. Go find us a CRM and look at all the CRMs and figure it out."

(00:20:33):
And the buyers looking at it going, "Geez, I don't know, man. There's a lot of CRMs out there, and I'm looking at all the things. I'm on G2 Crowd and there's 24 CRMs in the top right corner. And I'm looking at Gardner Group and I'm looking at this thing and I'm actually doing my research, but I'm overwhelmed. What I don't have is a clear picture of the market. What are the different approaches to this problem? Forget about products. What are the approaches to the problem? Where do the products fit in those approaches? What's a good solution for me look like? What should be my purchase criteria?" That's really hard for buyers to figure out.

(00:21:10):
And in general, in a sales process, we're not doing anything to help the buyer figure that out, even though we know it. We eat, sleep and breathe this market. We spend all day looking at competitors and thinking about this stuff and whatever. But we've got this idea, "Well, we shouldn't do this because first of all, we can't talk about the other guys that we'd be seen as bashing our competition, and that's bad." The other thing is, even if we did give our opinion, nobody would trust us because we're biased. But if you look at the research on this stuff, the research doesn't support that. The research actually says what B2B software buyers want in a sales interaction is perspectives on the market and help weighing their options. And we don't do that. We're just like, "Here's our stuff. You figure it out, it's up to you. You figure it out."

(00:22:03):
And so as a result, what we get are these buyers come in, they're overwhelmed with all this information. They come in and they sit in our sales process, and we overwhelm them even more with more features and more information. And what they're really worried about is, "What if I make a bad choice here? I've never done this before and I'm going to have to recommend to my boss. And if I make the wrong suggestion to my boss, maybe my boss thinks I'm stupid. Or maybe I buy something and the whole department hates me because awful to use. Or maybe I pick something and it's just bad software and then bad things happen for the business, maybe I get fired."

(00:22:40):
And so the data on this shows that for B2B, 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. And then when you look at, if you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of the...

April Dunford (00:23:00):
The old thing we were doing is better, that's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it," because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:23:23):
I think this is one of the most interesting insights that you share in your book and you also share this in the newsletter post about how buying software you could argue is harder than selling it because people will have learned there's skills and training for selling, but buying is, as you described, extremely stressful. Basically your job's on the line if you make a mistake. Is there anything more you can share along those lines just to help reinforce that buying software is extremely hard and stressful and people don't understand that?

April Dunford (00:23:50):
Once you get into that mindset, I think then you look at the situation a lot different. I think we've seen the statistics on this that says the buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying, "Nope, I'm not buying nothing." And in fact that's true 60% of the time. And so how do we combat that? The way we combat that is not just talking about ourselves, it's actually about trying to be helpful to that person in this very stressful situation that is trying to figure out how do I make a really good decision.

(00:24:27):
So what we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, "Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us. And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets." And so you can just think of it that way. So you don't need to know every single feature, every single thing. I'm giving you a bigger picture of the whole market and helping you feel good. Well, if you choose this or you choose that, now you know why.

Lenny (00:24:57):
I think what's interesting about this is a lot of startups fail because they can't convince anyone to switch from the status quo. And I think people always think of that as the current product is good enough and that's why they're losing, but I think this adds an additional wrinkle of it's also the person buying it is just like, "I don't want to add the stress to even decide and make the choice and put my butt on the line to switch." And I never thought of it that way.

April Dunford (00:25:22):
I think that hurdle is a lot more than you think. So we obviously have to compete with status quo, we can't ignore status quo, because sometimes status quo just is good enough and so we can't ignore that. We still lose deals to status quo, but we lose an awful lot of deals to just plain customer indecision, customers being more afraid of screwing up than missing out.

Lenny (00:25:46):
So to try to overcome that, to drill into the things you find most powerful, one is help the customer understand the bigger picture and why essentially they're falling behind, why maybe competition is going to have an advantage because they're thinking in a different way.

April Dunford (00:26:04):
Well, I'll throw something out about that.

Lenny (00:26:06):
Please.

April Dunford (00:26:10):
And I've heard people talk about this a lot that one of the things we could do in this situation when a customer is feeling this indecision is to lean into this FOMO and say, "Look, you're missing out. The competitors are all doing it and you're not doing it." And so this is an interesting question. And so I was super excited, Matt Dixon wrote this book called The JOLT Effect, and in that they studied two and a half million sales calls, they recorded on Gong and they studied it with AI, and then they looked at what happened after the sales call, so were these successful or not successful, did a deal happen or whatever. It's pretty rare that we get a chance to dig into some data like this.

(00:26:49):
And so what his data showed is if a customer is indecisive, throwing FOMO into the mix makes it worse. So they're less likely to close the deal if you throw that in. And the idea is that they're already stressed out and you're just putting more stress on them by pressuring them, by saying, "Oh, this is happening, bad things are going to..." You're like, "Bad things will happen if I do something, bad things happen if I don't do something, what do I do?"

Lenny (00:27:22):
They just put their head in the sand, right? They're just like, "Ah, forget it."?

April Dunford (00:27:24):
So they're just like, "Forget it, I'm doing nothing. Now I'm totally paralyzed." And so there's an assumption that companies are very motivated by this FOMO thing, but I think that that is not always true, and if the customer is actually indecisive, throwing in this FOMO thing isn't going to do it. So what does work in that situation is, one, giving them the tools to make the decision. So that includes paint the picture of the market, teaching them how to buy essentially. So teaching them, look, for customers like you, you just have to worry about these three, four things, and all this other stuff, it doesn't apply to you. That applies to bigger companies, that applies to whatever, so this idea of teaching a customer how to buy is one way to take that stress down.

(00:28:08):
And then there's a whole bunch of other techniques you can use. So one is if it's a really big deal, we can split it into smaller pieces, we can do things like offer you a money back guarantee, we can do things like sometimes we have services and support that are going to help you if things go bad and this is how we're going to make sure. So this idea of being able to take risk off the table is a really serious one if we've got a customer that is actually paralyzed because of this indecision thing.

Lenny (00:28:36):
That makes a lot of sense, basically it's like how do we help the buyer cover their ass if they made a mistake, because what you're saying is that's the main reason they're not buying your product.

April Dunford (00:28:43):
And this FOMO thing is just not going to do it.

Lenny (00:28:43):
That's so interesting. So I really like this framework. I wrote this down, teaching them how to buy, that is a really simple way of just thinking about this whole process.

April Dunford (00:28:53):
Well, it's funny, I was having this conversation with Bob Moesta, he did Jobs To Be Done.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Yeah, I watched that episode.

April Dunford (00:29:00):
So he's just the best. And so one of the things I think of is normally when we come at this we're like, "Well, how can we convince the customer that we do the job that they need to have done?" And obviously we need to do that, but there is this secondary job that the champion of the deal is, and that's how do I make a decision without getting fired? And so we got to help them accomplish that job, otherwise we don't get what we want, which is the money.

Lenny (00:29:28):
It's so interesting. And it's not even necessarily get fired, it's even the performance sufferers or they don't get the promotion, it's did they do a good job. This makes me think of a process at Airbnb we went through to buy community forum software and I just remember these massive teams of salespeople come to the office and pitching everyone on the software and they just keep pushing you to make what's the next step here, who do we need to roll in, who needs to buy into it? And it's just like, "Oh my God, it's so stressful. I have to keep this thing moving." And then there's IT coming in like, "Oh, we got to make sure it integrates with Salesforce." And you start with I just wanted the best community forum software because we were trying to build something really different and unique and you end up with like, "Okay, it's fine, just go with the thing that works with Salesforce. It's all good. I'm just going to move on to another process."

April Dunford (00:30:15):
Well, this is the thing, it's so easy to default to the market leader in that situation. The market leader has this big advantage that you can say, "You know what? Who's going to get me in trouble for picking Salesforce? Nobody." It's so easy to just flip back on that. And so if you're the challenger in this situation, the brand that's number two or number three, you've got to get over all of this inertia and tilting towards the status quo, because it's just so easy, it's the lowest risk decision, besides do nothing is to just pick the leader in the market and we'll just run with that.

Lenny (00:30:49):
I think the classic phrase was no one gets fired for buying Microsoft. I wonder is it Salesforce now that's the default version of that now?

April Dunford (00:30:55):
Yeah, the original one was IBM. [inaudible 00:30:57]

Lenny (00:30:56):
I think you're right. Oh, man.

April Dunford (00:30:59):
Now you totally get fired for buying IBM. I don't know what happens. The other thing you bring up is I think an interesting thing to think about too that really messes people up in these situations is that in B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen and so there's this complexity we don't have a consumer, but a lot of people I think overcomplicate that. In a typical B2B purchase process, we've got someone in that buying team is what we would call the champion. So that person is the person who's been tasked with, hey, pick us the accounting software or pick us the CRM, you figure it out. And so that person is the person that does the initial research, makes the short list, probably sits on the first calls, and then there's all these other people.

(00:31:49):
Now, the other people can't make a deal happen, but they can kill it a thousand ways. So the way this works is your positioning and your pitch needs to really work for the champion, because if it doesn't, you don't even get to talk to anybody else, you don't even get to go near anybody else if you don't make it out of the shortlist and you don't get the deal cooking. But once the deal is cooking it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups. So if you're the line of business buyer, let's say you're in the sales department and you're buying a CRM, IT is going to have to get involved at some point, and IT doesn't really care about the value of your CRM, but they do care does it meet the security requirements and does it integrate with the stuff we already have and how much of a pain is this thing going to be to manage, and so we're not actually pitching value to those people, we're just handling objections.

(00:32:46):
And so once we realize that, then we can get really tight on our positioning in our sales pitch. What we're really trying to do is just cook the champion, get the champion, and then once the deal's going we got to arm the champion for how to handle all these objections of all these other groups so that you can get a consensus to get a deal moving forward.

Lenny (00:33:05):
How do you actually do that? Is it ask them what are all the concerns you're hearing? Is it ask the individual stakeholders what your biggest concern is?

April Dunford (00:33:11):
Well, if we're really smart, we already know because we've done lots of deals. So if we're being a good partner in this, sometimes even in the very first meeting in that spot where we're talking about objectives, we're going to say, "Hey, look, IT is going to come in and they're going to be worried about this, this, and this, and don't worry, we got you."

(00:33:32):
So we're SOC 2 compliant, we do this, we do that, we know because we've done 15 deals and we know what these deals are like and we know what the stuff is going to be. You might have the champion come in and say, "Well, I don't know, end users might not like it." And it's like, "Okay, well, here's how we're going to get your end users on board, this is the training we have, this is the stuff we're going to do." The neat thing, if you have a product like [inaudible 00:33:54] on the front end of that, it takes that objection off the table. And you might have other things like you're going to take this to your boss and they're going to want to know ROI numbers, blah, blah, blah, and we've already done that, look, here's our calculator, if you give us this information, we can put this in, here's how you sell your boss.

(00:34:12):
So that's what we're doing. We're trying to arm them because we've done a million deals, they've never bought software like this before. So half the time you'll be doing deals and they don't even know what the purchase process is. And so if we're being good partners, we're like, "Okay, does this need to go to purchasing?" And they'll say, "Yeah, it probably does." Oh, well, here's what typically happens at purchasing. They're going to do this, this, this, and we're going to give you this stuff and that's going to help you get it through purchasing.

Lenny (00:34:40):
The way you're describing it now makes it feel like you need to be a big company for this to be useful because smaller companies don't have all these reps and they may not have the resources to do all these things you're describing. Who is this framework useful for? Can you use this approach if you're just, say, an early stage B2B?

April Dunford (00:34:53):
Well, so it's B2B products. If you don't have a sales team, I still think you can use this structure to build a story that marketing can use and you can use in different ways, and we can talk about that. But in the companies that I work with, they're B2B, they've got a sales team, and so the immediate thing we're doing is we're making a shift in positioning, we're building a sales pitch that reflects that positioning, we can immediately implement that in sales even though it's going to take a while for us to forklift the messaging and do other stuff and change our campaigns and everything else to match this new positioning, but we can tighten up the sales pitch and have an immediate impact over in sales on that. Second thing is that I've worked with tons of companies where the founder is the only sales rep and this works pretty good for that.

(00:35:39):
I don't think we need a ton of resources to do it, but I do think we need to have enough traction in the market that we understand how a deal typically goes. So if we haven't sold anything yet then we don't know yet, it's hard for us to help you buy something if we don't even know how to sell it. But if I've done 10 deals, I know what happens, I got a pretty good guess of what IT is going to say when you try to implement this stuff, I have a good guess of what's going to happen when we go to roll it out, I have a pretty good guess of what your boss might object to or might get excited by. And so I don't necessarily need a research team to go figure this out. This is just me trying to be helpful and help the champion do their job of getting this deal to the finish line.

Lenny (00:36:23):
So maybe the MVP of this approach is a deck that you continue iterating and adjust and restructure, and also bullet points of things you want to bring up like, "Okay, cool, IT is going to ask for these things," a few bullet points that you keep track of.

April Dunford (00:36:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I'm also thinking from the perspective of a product team building a product, they don't really sell it themselves. They work with sales, they work with marketing. Is there anything that you would recommend or that you think product teams could learn from this approach of selling that would help them build products in a different way or work with sales in a different way?

April Dunford (00:36:59):
Yeah. So here's what I think, the core of a good sales pitch is really deeply understanding your differentiated value, which is what is the value I can deliver that no other solution can. Often what I see at companies is you got a smart product team and they know a lot about the stuff they're building and why it's important and what the value is to the customer, and they did all this work on that when they were building it, but that information never made the jump to sales, because sales isn't even trying to pitch value. They're just pitching features like here's the dropdown menus, here's what they do. And so the first step in fixing this I think is to have a cross-functional team work on positioning.

(00:37:43):
So if I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product, deeply understand what's differentiated about it, deeply understands value, and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are, what the champion really wants to get done and doesn't want to get done, what the situation is in a typical account, and then all of this cool information sharing happens, which actually you end up with way better definition of your differentiated value in the first place.

(00:38:22):
And so once we've done that work, it is very natural then for us to work together on the sales pitch that reflects that. What typically happens is not that at all. What typically happens is product's working on some stuff, sales is working on some stuff, marketing's working on some stuff. Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, "I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see," and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.

Lenny (00:38:57):
That's a long time. So first podcast episode was all around positioning, and so folks want to get deep into that, they should listen to that, so we're not going to spend tons of time there, but differentiated value is a big part of this process also so I think it's worth spending a bit of time here. Could you maybe share a couple examples of what this is to give people a sense of what does it mean to share differentiated value?

April Dunford (00:39:20):
Yeah. So differentiated value is the answer to the question why pick us over the other alternatives? And so the way we get at that in positioning is we start with putting a stake in the ground of who do we actually compete with? And so if we didn't exist in the market, what would a customer do? And so typically there's some status quo thing, it might not even look like you, it might just be a spreadsheet, or do it with the intern or manual labor, and then there's whatever else ends up on a short list against us. And it's basically the definition of I got to beat all this plus indecision in order to win a deal, so I can stick my stake in the ground. Sales knows the answer to this question. If you have a sales team, they know the answer to this question, what would a customer do if we didn't exist, they know.

(00:40:06):
And then we get to the next step is, well, so what do we have that's different? And that's capability wise, feature function of the product or capability of the company, so it could be features, it could be your pricing model, it could be we have support in a way that the other folks don't. So there's all kinds of things it could be. It could be be the breadth of the portfolio that you have beyond that one product, we can fill whiteboards with this stuff. And then what we do is we go down that list of features and we say, "So what? You got advanced AI, whatever the heck the thing is, so what? Why does anybody care?" And the answer to that so what is your value. And because it came from this differentiated feature, it's generally value that the other guys can't deliver because they don't have the capabilities that underpin it.

(00:40:53):
So if I give you an example, a company I worked with a few years back, they've recently been acquired by Salesforce called LevelJump, and so they're in the sales enablement space, which is terrible. There's a million companies in the sales enablement space and they all look the same. And so LevelJump, so if you look at, well, what's the competitive alternatives, if I look at all the companies in the sales enablement space, you can put them into two buckets in terms of approaches, they're either a CMS like a jazzy content repository where you could make sure that people are using the right content and whatever, or they're an LMS, a learning management system, which I can build the course and certify you on the course, and that's how we're going to train the sales reps.

(00:41:39):
If you look at LevelJump, they're differentiated capability is they're the only one that's built on top of Salesforce. That's the feature, we're built on Salesforce, the other folks aren't. And then who cares? So what? And so when we first had a conversation about it, there was five or six different answers to that so what question, but the big answer was, well, because we're built on top of Salesforce, my sales enablement data is integrated with my sales data. And then you say, "Well, so what about that?" Well, because then that means I can actually tell did the sales enablement improve time to first deal or improve time to make quota? Well, so what about that? Well, if I improve that ramp time, then we get way more revenue faster. So that's the differentiated value.

(00:42:29):
When I go to do that in a sales pitch, I can translate that into my insight. My insight is every day your rep's not making [inaudible 00:42:36] it costs you money. So if we really want to solve sales enablement, don't we really want to have something where we can measure whether or not the sales enablement is working with sales metrics? Yeah, we do.

Lenny (00:42:47):
Interesting. So the differentiated value often informs the insight that you start with?

April Dunford (00:42:52):
It does. It absolutely is. The insight is basically the context that makes your differentiated value important, what is the thing you need to know to understand the importance of my differentiated value? In the case of Help Scout, the insight is, look, digital businesses like customer service is a growth driver, where does that come from? If you look at their differentiated value, it's there. And so we can just reverse it, flip it around. Even if the product wasn't necessarily constructed with that insight, maybe we got there sideways or the roundabout way or whatever, we iterated our way into that. We can look at the differentiated value and then basically reverse it out to the insight.

Lenny (00:43:33):
What's a sign that the differentiated value or insight that you've come up with just isn't clicking?

April Dunford (00:43:37):
If the differentiated value doesn't work in a sales pitch, what you'll get is the company going, "Why would I pay for that? This is not value for me, buddy." The companies I work with, the way I look at it is if you're in market and you're selling and you have happy, engaged customers, there's differentiated value there. That's why they picked you. That's why they love you. That's why they don't turn out on you. It's there. You might not know what it is, we might have to do a little process to get at it, but it's there and it exists.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Awesome. Another question that's been in the back of my mind since we started talking about differentiated values is just how honest should you be about the competition? Obviously there's a spectrum of extremely honest to super biased, what's your guidance on just how honest to be there?

April Dunford (00:44:34):
The posture I think you should assume in a sales situation, I had an old boss used to talk about this, is the posture we should have is calm confidence. So where that calm confidence comes from is we really understand why people should pick us. So this is differentiated value, we really understand it and we really understand who that's a really good fit for, and we don't even bother trying to chase anybody else.

(00:45:03):
So we should be able to come in and say, "Look, we're sales enablement that delivers results. If you don't care about those results, you shouldn't pick us. You should pick someone else." And so generally what we're trying to be is extremely honest. We're trying to come in and actually give credit where credit is due with the other approaches, because typically the other approaches work just fine for other kinds of companies. If you're really small and you're not growing e-commerce business, use a shared inbox. It's free, it's easy to use, there's no problems there, just use it. If you're really worried about bringing the cost down in a customer service center, maybe you should use Zendesk. And so I think the more we can act as a guide in this situation and come in and say, "Look, these guys are good for this, these folks are good for this, and we're good for this. And you might not care about that, and if you don't care about that, we're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us." But I think that...

April Dunford (00:46:00):
We're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us. But I think that this calm confidence idea is that where we know the client should pick us, we should be unafraid to fight for that business. But we should totally walk away from business where we're not the best fit. We shouldn't be chasing that business at all.

Lenny (00:46:20):
And this comes back to teaching them how to buy again and again. For these cases where you're like, "This is not a fit." Ideally you know that before you fly to their office and pitch them.

April Dunford (00:46:29):
Yeah, generally you've had some kind of qualification happen upstream, and so that qualification could be done in lots of different ways. If you've got some kind of product like growth motion in the beginning, you're looking for signals in that. And if the signals aren't there, then you're not talking to them. And so if you've designed your signals right, then you already know there's intent there. You already know you're a fit. You already know stuff. The way a lot of companies do this is they'll have inside sales do a qualification call before they set up a first call with a sales rep. In that qualification call, you're trying to make sure is this the right person? Do they have a need that we can actually meet? Is this actually a good fit for what we do? And if they're not, they don't even make it to the call.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Mm-hmm. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B1B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q3, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.

(00:48:09):
Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:48:32):
Another question around this idea of differentiated value and just alternative approaches is there's a certain previous guest who was very big on creating a category being extremely important, and that potentially being the only way to build a legendary business. I know you have a different perspective on that because in theory if you go that direction, there's no alternative. It's like "We're the one." What's your take on that?

April Dunford (00:48:55):
Well, so here's a few things. So one, obviously creating a category is not the only way to create a legendary business because the vast majority of legendary businesses did not create the categories that they're in. So Google did not create search, Facebook did not create social network. There's so many of them. It's actually more of an exception to the rule that the company is creating a category than the other way around. So I think it's a bit disingenuous to say the only way. It is a way to build a big business, no question about that. But it's absolutely not the only way. In fact, it is not the most common way, but it is a way and it does work. So that's one thing. The second thing is that category creation is interesting. Like most companies, if you look at their arc, even the category creators that are successful, they did not start out as category creators.

(00:49:53):
So they started out as a niche play in an existing category, and that's because that's generally the easiest way to get traction for a company early because what is the job of the market category? The job of a market category is to help answer the question, what is this thing all about? If I'm positioning an existing category, I can say, "Well, I'm CRM for very small businesses." That was Salesforce's initial positioning. I didn't have to explain to you what a CRM was, that already existed. There was already billion dollar company in that space. We know what a CRM is, and I could say "We're CRM for very small businesses. The reason you can use in this very small businesses is we don't have any software. So you don't have to have an IT department to babysit it. It's fantastic."

(00:50:34):
So most companies start there. Now what happens is that if you become the dominant player in that space, which again, category creation folks talk about this like no category creator has ever lost the market. In fact, most category creators wins their market. Like what happened to MySpace? What happened to Ask Jeeves? It didn't work out so good for them. Most category creators actually get overtaken by fast followers. So if we look at the CRM market, Siebel was the big dominant player there and now they're not. So now we've got Salesforce. Once you're the dominant player in that market, a cool move to do is to actually extend the boundaries of the category so that you can continue to grow. And most of the category creation examples we see are companies that when they were 200, 300, 400 million revenue dominating their space, then decided to move the goalposts and say, "Well actually now we're expanding into all these other areas and we're going to call this category something. And that's what it is."

(00:51:38):
And there's loads of examples of that. Like Qualtrics for example, is a company that a lot of people talk about very successful category creation. Well, they were survey software up until there were 300 million revenue just like everybody else in an existing category. So that got them there and that worked just fine. Oh, well, once we're dominating it, now we can say it's whatever, it is, customer experience software, whatever it is. Snowflake. Another good example like data warehousing in the cloud, they were that data warehousing, an existing market, were data warehousing for the cloud. That is not category creation. And that took them all the way up to the point where they were about to go public and now they're cloud data, which is their attempt to expand and say, "Well, it's not just data warehousing, it's actually data lakes and all other data stuff."

(00:52:22):
And so that's a smart move for them because they're now very well known in that space. I'm not saying category creation is a bad thing. There are examples of company that came right out of the gate and successfully created a category and then survived to own the category longer term. But a more common thing that happens is that the company does the hard work of creating the category and in exactly the moment where the category starts to take hold, fast follower can come in with fresh funding and a lot of it and learn from all your mistakes and come in and knock you off the peak right when you think you've made it.

(00:53:01):
So I think category creation is, again, it's good, it works, but I think we have to be very careful when we're thinking about doing that at an early stage business or a business that isn't already dominating the category that they're in. It's much more common to see companies come in, shave off a piece of the market, dominate that, and then successfully branch out. It's what Jeffrey Moore called bowling pin strategy. Almost all successful companies follow bowling pin strategy.

Lenny (00:53:29):
Wait, what is that? Let's touch on that real quick.

April Dunford (00:53:31):
Oh yeah, you remember that thing. It's funny how many times I've talked about bowling pin strategy in the last two months. So this comes from a bunch of work that was done around the way innovation gets adopted, blah, blah. So there's a bunch of research done on this stuff, and I'm going to misquote it because Jeffrey Moore stuff, I've been reading it for decades. But bowling pin strategy goes like this. The easiest way to take over a great big market is to define a segment of the market that is underserved by the market leader.

(00:53:59):
And so if you think about a bunch of bowling pins, we're going to circle around the lead pin, which is this little piece of the market that's easy for us to go get, and the market leader probably doesn't care about it. And so we knock over that pin and knocking over that pin enables us to get to the three pins right beside it. And so now I'm established here as a beachhead and I can go get the next three pins, I'm going to knock those over, and eventually I get big enough to challenge the market leader and then I overtake them.

(00:54:28):
So the example for my early career was I worked at this company, we thought we were enterprise software. We narrowed it down to CRM for investment banks, and so we literally drew bowling pins for our investors and said, "Lead pin is CRM for investment banks. Once we knock that over, then we're going to go to retail banking, then we're going to be CRM for banking. And then once we knock that over, we're going to go to insurance, then we're going to be CRM for financial services. Once we knock that over, then we're going to be a great big company and we're going to challenge Siebel to be CRM for enterprise software." Instead we got acquired by Siebel for like $1 billion, but whatever. So most companies, if you look at the history of them, they actually start that way. And so yeah, if we just fast forwarded to when they were 300 million, we can say "Category creation's the only thing to do," but it's like, well, what happened before then? That was something different.

Lenny (00:55:21):
Awesome. Let's come back to your framework. I'm looking at the list of bullet points. So we've covered a lot of this already actually. So there's the insight where you helped them understand what's happening in the world and what's changing and why this is important. Then you talk about what the alternative approaches might be, pros and cons. Then there's this third step, which we haven't talked about yet, which is sharing the perfect world characteristics of a perfect solution. Can you talk a bit about that and why that's important?

April Dunford (00:55:47):
So this is the conclusion of the setup phase. So if I'm Help Scout for example, the conclusion is we say, "Look, you really want customer success software that's as easy to use as an inbox. You're never going to outgrow it, but it was built from the ground up to be deliver an amazing service." And so it's this part of the pitch where we actually get agreement with the customer that we are aligned in terms of our point of view on the universe. So it's where I say, "Okay, we've had our little discussion about the pros and cons of the other alternatives," and we say, "So look, so are you with me, man? Can we all agree that a really good solution for you would have A, B and C?" And the customer is either like, "Yeah, right," or they're not. And so if they're right with you on this definition of the perfect world, then I've got you. I've already won the deal and I haven't even talked about us yet because the way I've set it up, I'm the only one that can deliver that.

(00:56:49):
So if you say, "Right," all I got to do is prove that I can do that and get you over the hurdle that it's possible for you to adopt it.

Lenny (00:56:59):
Sounds too easy.

April Dunford (00:57:01):
Yeah, I mean...

Lenny (00:57:02):
It's like you lure them in.

April Dunford (00:57:04):
If all of this was easy, Lenny we would be on a beach drinking out of a coconut.

Lenny (00:57:09):
Oh man, let's make it happen. Okay, so that's the setup. What do you call the second part again?

April Dunford (00:57:14):
It's the follow through-

Lenny (00:57:14):
The follow through.

April Dunford (00:57:15):
... which is really focused on differentiated value. So in the second part, the first step is usually we introduce our stuff, which is where the market category is important. So we come in and we say, "Okay, can we agree that a really good solution should tick these boxes? Yes. Okay, good. Now let's talk about us. Okay, so we believe that. That's why we build what we build."

(00:57:36):
So here I am, I'm Help Scout, we're customer service software for digital businesses or whatever our market category is. So we introduce it just to get people straight in their mind about what it is, and then we move to here's the value, here's how we do it. If we think about a typical sales call, like let's say a sales call is half an hour, 45 minutes, I would expect to spend more than half of the time in the sales call in this differentiated value phase. So if we're doing a demo, that's the demo, and we're saying, "Okay, step one, let me show you how we do this. So easy to use as an inbox. Here's the features. Never have to outgrow it, here's the features. Delivers amazing customer experience, here's the features." And so that's where we're getting to the meat of what you thought you were getting when you clicked on the button that said, "Give me a demo."

(00:58:25):
So that's what we're doing there. And then we end with these three little pieces. One is generally I got to show you some proof that I can do what I say I can do. So if I'm claiming this thing delivers an amazing customer experience, how do I prove that? Well, I can prove it by other customers saying it was amazing. That's one way to prove it. If I had some independent third party data that proved whatever I was claiming, I could show that there too. But a lot of times what we're doing is we're like, "Let me show you how this worked in a company that used our stuff. So this is what the before looked like. They did this thing, here's the after." And so customer case study is usually good way to do that, but there's usually a step called proof, which is, I showed you the value, now here's the proof that I can actually deliver on that value and it's not just me blowing smoke.

(00:59:16):
And then the step after that then is this optional objection step where they say, "Oh yeah, sounds good, but IT is never going to go for it," or "Sounds good, but maybe it's going to be too expensive," or something. And so you're going to handle that objection as best as you can. And then you finish with the ask, which is whatever the next step in your sales process is. So it's, "Hey, so what we have to do to get a deal cooking here, do we have to get IT involved? Does IT need to see it? Would you like us to come in and present with you with IT or do you want me to just help you work on some stuff for IT?" It's whatever your next step in the sales process is.

Lenny (00:59:56):
Awesome. So let me read through this just to have it also succinctly here in case people are taking notes or trying to remember the stuff. So there's the setup, there's the follow through. Within the setup, you have the insight, the alternative approaches, pros and cons, in the perfect world. And then you introduce your product, talk about the differentiated value, share the proof of why it works, potentially handle objections, silent objections, and then the ask of what comes next.

April Dunford (01:00:21):
That's right. That's it.

Lenny (01:00:22):
In terms of knowing if this is working and if your differentiated value works or if your insight works, do you have kind of a heuristic of a success rate that feels right? How often should this work for you to feel like "I think we have it?"

April Dunford (01:00:34):
Well, so generally if the sales pitch isn't working, it's because the positioning was weak.

(01:00:41):
And so companies that jumped straight to building the new sales pitch without going back and really making sure that they really nailed the differentiated value, who knows? Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. And a lot of times it doesn't, I think. And so in the work I do with my clients, we go all the way back to the beginning. So we go right back to let's work on the positioning first. Now, if I've got the smartest people from the company in the room and we've done enough deals that we are pretty knowledgeable about how customers buy and what they like and what they don't know. If I've got the senior executive team in the room and they've got a reasonable amount of customer experience, we can pretty much feel good that the positioning we come up with if we're following a process will be good.

(01:01:25):
Then it's just a matter of taking that positioning, mapping it to the sales pitch and then going to test it. So I think there's a bunch of things in testing that are really important. So one is we absolutely need sales involved in building the pitch. If we don't have sales involved in building the pitch, the pitch is never going to stick. The rule with sales reps is even if they don't like their current pitch, they're comfortable with the current pitch and they know it and they've memorized it and they have a little joke they tell on slide three. So they're not going to give up the current pitch without a fight. So you got to get sales management involved in building a new pitch, and then I would never just build the new pitch and then heave it over the wall and say, "Good luck, Chuck." Because what'll happen is they'll come up with all kinds of excuses why they can't use this pitch.

(01:02:07):
Instead, what you do is you take your best sales rep, your best one, and you bring your best sales rep over and you train them on the new pitch. They got to learn it, they got to pitch it to you, pitch it to the head of sales. We do a bunch of repetition on that, and then we have that rep test the pitch with qualified prospects. So we don't go to existing customers. They've already been polluted with the old positioning and the old pitch, and this needs to work with a qualified prospect, so let's do it in the way it was intended. We're going to take qualified prospects and work that new pitch with them. Usually what we'll do is a test period where after every pitch we'll huddle and say, "What worked? What didn't work? Maybe that word is tripping people up. Maybe we need to move this slide from here to here," and so we'll tune it.

(01:02:53):
And then after we've done a bunch of pitches, one of two things happens. And so in this test structure, I am very much relying on the expertise of my best rep to know what's good. So after the best rep is comfortable with the pitch, done a bunch of pitches, re-twizzled it, at some point the rep will say, "Okay, I think we're done optimizing this pitch, and I'm not going back to the old pitch. I'm sticking with this pitch because I think this one works better." An experienced sales rep will know that, whether the pitch is better than the old pitch, if you give them the opportunity to feel comfortable with it, work with it a bit and pitch a bunch of new prospects with it.

(01:03:38):
So if your best sales rep says, "Oh, this is way better than the old pitch. I can just feel it from the way people react to it and the number of times we've been able to convert people over into actual opportunities from a first call." Then what you do is at that point I call that pass. So then we take that rep, we can film them doing the pitch for training, and then we can take that rep, go back to the rest of the sales team and have that rep sell everybody else on it. So that rep goes back and says, "Listen up people, you're stupid if you're using that old pitch, which sucks. This new pitch is way better. Trust me, I'm the best rep on this whole team. By the way here's the list of deals I have cooking in the pipeline that I got using this deck. You should go do it and I'm going to teach you how to do it."

(01:04:24):
Now I got sales, teaching sales, teach and sales instead of marketing, sort of throwing something over the wall and crossing their fingers and saying, "Hey, I hope this works." What we should see is an immediate uplift in what happens after first call. So most of the time what that is we get a higher percentage of deals converting into opportunities after that first substantive calls. Sometimes depending on the quality of the pipeline we had coming in, we're actually disqualifying more. But sometimes that's a good thing.

(01:04:54):
But what we should see is an immediate uptick. It's stuff coming into the pipeline. It's a neat trick to pull, especially right now when everybody's budgets are really tight and you're just trying to squeeze more juice out of the lemon. It's a really easy way to get some more juice out of the pipeline. Just go in, tighten up your positioning, tighten up that sales pitch. And we can have instant impact with that because we can roll that out in a couple of weeks and start getting better deals flowing through the pipeline because these customers are understanding your value better, understanding why to pick you better. It's just easy, low hanging fruit to do when the economy's bad.

Lenny (01:05:32):
To give people a sense of maybe how easy that might be, how long would you suggest people spend on maybe tweaking their positioning and then also on this pilot, how much total time could it take to potentially significantly increase sales?

April Dunford (01:05:45):
So in the customers that I work with, when we do the positioning stuff, the positioning stuff takes a week. We're beginning and we're done in a week. We're all about speed on this thing. We're trying to get the thing happening fast. So we're in and out on the positioning in a week. It might take you, it depends on the company, the bigger the company, the slower this is, but some big companies are actually quite fast, and if you're motivated, it shouldn't take long for us to take that pitch and make it real.

(01:06:11):
Then we got to find a rep, train the rep, and then how long it takes us to test it really depends on how much deal flow you've got. So if you're working on monster deals and you don't actually get that many qualified prospects to pitch, that might take a few weeks. But if you've got a lot of prospects coming through the door, and you can get through this fairly quickly. So I've had companies do it start to finish. We got new pitch out the door and people using it in two weeks. That's about as fast as you can get it done. Most folks, I would say take about a month.

Lenny (01:06:39):
Cool. That is a very short-

April Dunford (01:06:40):
Sometimes you're like IBM and who knows when you get to it, right? But most folks could get through it if everybody's motivated, we can get it out and have it running a month.

Lenny (01:06:50):
You mentioned marketing and earlier you said that marketing is involved in this process in some way. What's your advice to just how to involve marketing, where they fit in?

April Dunford (01:06:58):
Yeah, so usually marketing is going to end up being the stewards of the positioning once the positioning is done. So they're going to end up being positioning police after this because a lot of the positioning stuff is going to take the form of marketing things. So they're invested in this. So when I was the VP marketing, I was the person that would instigate the positioning thing, let's get everybody together and work on the positioning. And then I would usually be the person that is driving, getting the sales pitch figured out, but it's me and sales and product working together. And then once the sales pitch is done, depending on the size of the organization and whether or not you have sales enablement or somebody inside sales that can babysit the pitch. Usually me and the head of sales would work on, "Okay, this is the pitch and this is locked down and we're not actually going to change this pitch until something happens that requires us to change the positioning. And then that's when we'll re-look at the pitch."

(01:07:55):
So we would look at recertifying the reps every quarter on the pitch and all that kind of stuff. And that would be generally, me in partnership with the head of sales. But it depends on how you do it. I don't think it really matters who owns it. If you have a good product marketing organization, good product marketing organization generally is very concerned with the positioning and the pitch, and those two things sit in their purview, but depends on how you define it. I can't wait till you get Airbnb. Tell us how this stuff works. They're different because they're a consumer, but companies are arranged in all different ways. So if you have product marketing, it looks one way. If you don't, it looks another way. Somebody's got to kind of be the owner of this thing though. And so we have to decide who that's going to be.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Just a couple more questions. One is to motivate people to do this. What kind of impact have you seen at companies that invest this time and rethink the way they pitch?

April Dunford (01:08:49):
Well, so people don't like me to talk about revenue stuff. Hugely what we've seen though is again, the immediate impact is felted sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that.

April Dunford (01:09:00):
Impact is felt in sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that. Because sometimes what the worry is, is we've got this old positioning and they came in through the pipeline that way. So they were exposed to our marketing somewhere with this old positioning, and then we hit them with the new positioning with this sales pitch. And aren't they going to be all like, "Oh, you moved my cheese." And usually it ends up not being a problem at all. So usually what we see immediately is an uptick in what's happening in sales. And so I've had a couple of companies tell me they've doubled the number of deals that they're bringing from first sales call to opportunity just by tightening up the pitch and getting that going. I think that's not unusual. I worked at a company where we did it in-house where I was the VP marketing, and we, within two quarters, had doubled the revenue just by tightening up the pitch. Just tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:53):
Holy shit. All right.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:54):
No big deal.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Yep.

Lenny (01:09:54):
Okay. So-

April Dunford (01:09:56):
It was a big shift in positioning, I'll tell you that. Not small. Most of the time, we're not doing that. Most of the time, it's a tightening. We're not saying, "Oh, we used to be this and now we're this." Most of the time, it's a tightening, but usually the pitches are so bad. I'm telling you they're so bad that there's this low hanging fruit there that if we could improve it even a little bit, it actually has this big impact on how much stuff survives down the pipe.

Lenny (01:10:25):
And again, if folks want to go deep into the positioning step, your first book Obviously Awesome, is a great guide, and our first podcast episode goes through this. Plus you have a guest post in my newsletter where you give them a quick start guide. So there's so many tools to help you through this process.

April Dunford (01:10:38):
So many tools.

Lenny (01:10:39):
The other thought I've had in the back of my mind as we've been chatting is a previous guest, Andy Raskin, has a different framework, feels similar, but I know they're different. His framework starts with a shift that's happened in the world, and then here's who's going to win in the shift, here's who's going to lose. And then he goes into why this product is the best. What's your perspective on that approach versus this approach and the big differences?

April Dunford (01:11:01):
So the thing with that framework is I do think it works in certain conditions, but again, I think the conditions might be kind of edgy. So there's a couple of things that I think are lacking in that structure for a sales pitch. So the first one is there's actually no concept of differentiated value in that pitch, which for me is a giant miss. So in that pitch, it assumes that new is inherently valuable and old is inherently bad, and sometimes that's true. So sometimes there's just you versus the status quo and the status quo is some terrible old thing, some legacy thing or it's manual processes or something, and you're the only thing out there, then you can get away with that. But most of the time, we don't have that. Most of the time, there's multiple new ways of doing something and you just can't say, "Well, I'm the only new and the rest of you are old and bad."

(01:11:55):
So usually I've got to thread the needle. And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that for most companies, if we really understood customer and decision, old is good, it's safe, it's not risky. And does anybody ever say, "No, I'm not going to buy Salesforce. That's the old stuff,"? I just don't think that happens. So in a lot of cases, I don't think you can rely, it's lazy to say, "Buy this because it's new and new is better." Most of the time, the customers are going to want to know, well, what's better about it? Tell me what the value is that I can't get anywhere else. And you're going to have to get more specific than just saying, "Trust me, it's new and new is good." So that's the first thing. The second thing is this idea of starting with a trend. On the surface it looks kind of good, but the problem is often the trend is not unique to you. So everybody else sees the trend too. And so you are starting in a way that any of your competitors could start the same way.

(01:12:59):
I did this for years where I was taught to do problem solution. We would define the problem like a trend. We'd say, "Well, the change in the world." I was selling databases and I'd say, "Change in the world, data is exponentially growing." It's like, no shit. We all know that. All of my competitors could say that, and all of my competitors deal with the trend in the same way. So unless you have a particularly unique take on the trend, well, then it's not the trend at all really, is it? It's your insight into the trend. So I don't think trend is that great because it's not always unique to you. And ideally what we want is something that we can say that none of our competitors can. And typically a trend is something outside of our control. It's out in the world and everybody else can see it too.

(01:13:47):
So I don't think it's great. I think that structure looks a lot like the structure we use in a VC pitch or an investor pitch because we're talking about much longer timelines and we can say, "Look, the world is really changing and 10 years from now there's going to be chaos and destruction and the only one standing is us and therefore there is no competition." And because the timeframes are longer and we're talking about disruption of an entire market, which is pretty theoretical, we can get away with a lot of that stuff in investor pitch. In fact, we want to go there in investor pitch. Sales pitch is all about right now. Sales pitch is like, okay, I'm going to exchange my money for right now. You can't get too far into the future. Otherwise, all I'm doing is giving everybody a reason to delay, which they're likely to do anyway because they're indecisive about what they should do.

Lenny (01:14:39):
I feel like I need a debate version of this podcast where people come on and-

April Dunford (01:14:43):
I know, but here's the thing that I think people should think about when they're looking at all this stuff because it's terribly confusing if you're trying to figure this out. The one thing I really dislike about the category creation folks is they say that's the only way that you can be successful. And in general, that's just not true about anything. There's lots of ways to do everything. And so I think people should mess around with stuff. And for any of these frameworks, I think they should look at it and see if it works for them and their situation. And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

(01:15:16):
And I think they should steal things from wherever they can steal it and figure out what works in their own situation. My stuff, I like to think is a starting point, folks should use it as a starting point, but people shouldn't be slaves to it. There are lots of things that work at a market, and I think the only thing that we know for certain is that we can't say, "Well, this is the rule and it always works like this." If it was that easy, again, this wouldn't be so hard. We wouldn't have podcasts and newsletters and all kinds of things trying to figure this stuff out.

Lenny (01:15:49):
Extremely true. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

April Dunford (01:15:54):
Oh yeah. Lightning round. Oh gosh. It gives me stress. Okay.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Okay, question number one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

April Dunford (01:16:04):
Well, that's an easy question. So right now I'm really into Matt Dixon's work right now, which we've mentioned him a couple of times on the podcast, but Matt Dixon's new book called The JOLT Effect is really great just because there's all this data and the things that he discovered with that data, a lot of it go against what we would consider accepted sales wisdom. And so I think that book is full of juicy nuggets and everybody should look at it. His previous book, The Challenger Sale, and there was a companion book to that called The Challenger Customer. Those were also excellent and based on a deep set of research. And those books are older now, but what we see in The JOLT Effect is all the stuff holds true. All the stuff from The Challenger Sale has not changed in 10 years. So I think those books together are really cool.

(01:16:54):
The other one that I always recommend is the original book on positioning, which is the book by Ries and Trout Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. I have my copy of it, is dogeared. I probably read that book 100 times and I still see stuff in that book that I didn't see before. So I think if you really want to go deep on this positioning stuff, my book is the how to book. Their book is what is it in the first place book. And I think everybody that's interested in positioning should go read that.

Lenny (01:17:19):
Amazing. By the way, I have your first book somewhere behind me there. I don't know where it is, but it's there.

April Dunford (01:17:23):
I got mine right here so I can do this gag. There it is.

Lenny (01:17:23):
Nailed it.

April Dunford (01:17:27):
There's the new one, there's the old one.

Lenny (01:17:27):
The YouTube audience can see that trick that you've learned. Second question, what is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

April Dunford (01:17:36):
Oh man, I'm going to get in trouble for this. So you know Bong Joon-ho is the guy that did the movie Parasite?

Lenny (01:17:47):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:47):
So [inaudible 01:17:48] before Parasite, there was this book called, this movie called Snow Piercer. It's really old. I think it came out in-

Lenny (01:17:54):
I've seen that. Is that with the train?

April Dunford (01:17:54):
2013. Have you seen it?

Lenny (01:17:54):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:57):
So I love this movie so much. So recently I went on a train trip with my dad and before I went to the train trip, we got talking about trains. And then we all had to go watch Snow Piercer again. Like me and my daughter watching Snow Piercer. We're really into this movie. And it's funny, when it came out, I was working at a startup and the CEO came and said, "Seen any good movies lately?" And I was like, "Oh man, you got to see this movie Snow Piercer." And he went on a first date with a woman and he came back the next day and he was so mad. He was not just kind of mad. He was really mad at me. He was like, "That was the worst movie I've ever seen." I was like, "Dude, you should have told me you were going on a date. I didn't know."

Lenny (01:18:40):
Yeah, that is my experience with that movie. I did not enjoy it, but I think you have to go into it [inaudible 01:18:46]

April Dunford (01:18:46):
It's polarizing. You either think it's amazing or you're like, that was terrible. What did I just watch?

Lenny (01:18:52):
This explains your taste in movies. We learned a lot about you, April. That movie is something else.

April Dunford (01:19:00):
Did you see Parasite? That was amazing.

Lenny (01:19:02):
That was amazing. Very different. Not what I imagined. I didn't realize it was the same person.

April Dunford (01:19:06):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (01:19:08):
All right. Okay, cool. That's two movies for people to watch. I'm curious how people think of Snow Piercer.

April Dunford (01:19:13):
Be warned don't go on a date with this.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Oh man, I still think about that movie sometimes. Next question, what is a favorite interview question you like to ask people that you're interviewing? Usually this is for when you're hiring, so whatever this comes up for you.

April Dunford (01:19:28):
So back when I was running teams internally back in my VP marketing days, I felt like a lot of marketing folks came with a certain amount of bad habits, particularly startup marketing folks. It's a bit of the wild west in marketing. And so sometimes they'd come in and you get into somebody new and they'd be really smart, but they learned something at the previous company that you're like, please never do that here. It's not going to work here. And so I developed a thing where I was just looking for attitude. Were you enthusiastic? Are you super into what we're doing here? And I can teach you pretty much anything. The only thing I can't teach you is persuasive writing. And I think that's a learnable skill. I think people can learn how to do persuasive writing.

(01:20:12):
I just don't have time to teach it to you myself. And so I used to give people a writing test, so I'd say, "Look, think of something you bought recently and write me two paragraphs and just sell me on it." And I used to love that test because people could either do it or they can't. And there's just so much stuff we end up doing in product marketing and marketing that involves a little bit of writing that it's kind of a foundational skill. And if you don't have that, that was the one thing I couldn't teach you.

Lenny (01:20:42):
Wow, that is fascinating. I've never heard of that as an interview question. And I love it. I feel like product managers-

April Dunford (01:20:47):
I stole it from a company that made me do it before I got hired, and I was like, this is a really smart thing. I'm [inaudible 01:20:53] stealing it. My thing was I got anxiety and I couldn't decide what product to write about, and I had literally just bought a new pair of running shoes. So I wrote two paragraphs about my new Brooks distance running shoes. But it was good. I got the job.

Lenny (01:21:09):
It is an excellent segue to our next question, which is, is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

April Dunford (01:21:15):
Right now I'm kind of into, I don't even know how to describe this category of things, but things that are kind of low tech but are awesome. And so one of the category of things that I really love right now is I'm really into fountain pens. I don't know if you've ever written with a fountain pen. [inaudible 01:21:35]

Lenny (01:21:35):
I haven't, but I know what they are.

April Dunford (01:21:36):
And so there's this company, Lamy, they're based in Germany, and they make the world's greatest fountain pens. They're beautiful, they're amazing. Some of them are really expensive. If you want to spend a lot of money on a pen, you can. But they have this one called the AL-Star, which is not an expensive pen. It's 20, $30. It may be expensive for a pen, but it's not so much money that you wouldn't feel bad if you lost it. So Lamy AL-Star. That's my great product lately. I don't have one right here. I should, it'd be a great prop to pick it up, but I actually don't have my bag here and it's in my bag. But Lamy AL-Star. You Google it. These are beautiful pens. And then if you haven't written with a fountain pen, it takes a minute to get used to it, but then it's like, gosh, it just feels great. You'll never write with a ballpoint pen again.

Lenny (01:22:22):
I was going to ask, is it the feel of the writing that you really enjoy about it?

April Dunford (01:22:25):
Feel. Totally different. Yeah. Amazing.

Lenny (01:22:29):
I use Muji pens. I don't know if you know these pens.

April Dunford (01:22:31):
Oh yeah, these are actually really good. They're like roller ball pens, roller ball pen, very good, but not as good as the fountain pen.

Lenny (01:22:31):
It's no fountain pen.

April Dunford (01:22:38):
The Muji pen is pretty good.

Lenny (01:22:39):
Then do you have to dip it in ink and stuff? How does that work?

April Dunford (01:22:41):
No. You actually, they either come with a little cartridge that you stick in or if you feel bad about the environment, you don't want to be throwing out cartridges all the time, there's a refillable cartridge, so you basically just stick another thing and it sucks it up and yeah, you don't dip it in ink. That would be crazy. I can't take that on the airplane, man.

Lenny (01:22:58):
Confiscate your ink. All right, questions get a little more challenging potentially or really easy. Do you have a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, you like to share with people, that you find useful to come back to?

April Dunford (01:23:11):
My thing lately is, and maybe this is just an old person thing, but my thing lately is nothing's a big deal. Nothing's a big deal, nothing's a big deal. And so you'll have stuff that you think is a really big deal, positive or negative, and you'll be like, wow, if this thing happened, it'd be so great, and then it happens and you're like, yeah, it's pretty great, but things are good otherwise, or it'll be the opposite. Like, oh, if this thing happened, it'd be so bad. Then it happens and you're like, that wasn't that bad. And so I don't know if this is good or bad, but lately I'm in this zone of I'm in this kind of chill zone where I'm like, nothing's a big deal, man. Everything's cool.

Lenny (01:23:56):
That super resonates. And as much as you say that to yourself, it's still hard to convince yourself of that sometimes. But that is a really good motto. I'm going to steal that myself. I kind of say that to myself often in different way.

April Dunford (01:24:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:24:10):
What is the most valuable lesson your mom or your dad taught you?

April Dunford (01:24:15):
Yeah, it is funny because it's a little bit related to that. So my dad ran a business, so I grew up in a really small town and my dad and it's cottage country in Canada. And so my dad ran the local toys for tourists, like boats and motorcycles and ATVs and that sort of thing. And he ran that business for years and years and he sold it a few years back when he retired. But it's a neat thing to grow up in entrepreneurial family because you kind of see this highs and lows. The business is really good. Then the business was really bad and then we were all broke and then the business was good and we were not broke. So there was this thing, and my dad used to always kind of have this attitude of you just got to grind it out.

(01:25:01):
You're just going to grind it out. There's going to be good stuff, there's going to be bad stuff, but the key is to just keep going, just keep going. And so he ran that business for whatever, 30, 40 years. I don't know. His motto is the home of fun since '71. So he started it in '71. I think he sold it three, four years ago. So a long time.

Lenny (01:25:21):
Wow.

April Dunford (01:25:22):
It all worked out good in the end. And so I don't know, I think there's something cool about growing up in a family where you can see the highs and lows and then again be like everything's we're just grinding it out over here. Nothing's a big deal.

Lenny (01:25:34):
It's clear where all that comes from now.

April Dunford (01:25:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:25:37):
Final question. You do a lot of traveling, you do a lot of speaking, you go to a bunch of cities. I'm curious just what is your favorite either city that you go to that maybe people may not know about or venue that you speak at?

April Dunford (01:25:49):
It's such a cliche, but I love Paris. I just love it. But for me, Paris is like a particular vibe. So when I was in university, I did an exchange when I was in engineering and I did third year engineering at a school just outside of Paris. And so I spent the whole year there, learned a bit of French. My French was pretty good at the end. My French is really bad now. So I kind of get Paris. I like Paris. And so when I go to Paris, I just have the best time. I have my set of restaurants I want to go to. I have my handful of places I want to go shopping. I put my butt down in a cafe, look at the beautiful people, drink my nice coffee. I just really dig the whole vibe of Paris and people are starting to know that now. So French companies will call me and they'll say, "Do we get a Paris discount? We hear you like coming here." And I go, "Okay."

Lenny (01:26:50):
Now this is going to [inaudible 01:26:51]

April Dunford (01:26:51):
There's a great product management conference there called La Product Conference run by these folks at Tega, shout out to Tega. So I've been there a number of times for their conferences and they do an amazing job and the venue is really great. It changes around. But last year, the last time I went there, which was two years ago, it was at an old theater in [inaudible 01:27:13]. Absolutely beautiful. And that was a pretty great venue in a great city with a great conference. So yeah, shout out to French people.

Lenny (01:27:22):
Oh man. That sounds dreamy. Paris. I see how that could be a favorite. April, I think we accomplished everything we were hoping to accomplish. I think everyone that has listened to this podcast is going to be better at pitching and selling. It feels like even if they take one element of this framework, say starting with an insight or focusing on different value will make them better. And so I'm proud of us. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

April Dunford (01:27:50):
So where can people find me? I'm aprildunford.com. The only social media I'm doing these days is LinkedIn. I'm a bit social media-ed out. I'm experimenting a little on threads and Instagram, but LinkedIn is a good place to find me if you just want low lift way to follow my stuff. But I'm doing all the things now, Lenny, I got a podcast, it's called Positioning with April Dunford. I got a newsletter that's also called Positioning. You can find that if you go to, it's on Substacks, you can find it there, otherwise aprildunford.com/books and you can sign up there. But those are the big things. And then there's the books, obviously, if you want to learn more about this stuff. Everything I know is in the book. There isn't stuff that I know that isn't in the book to be honest.

Lenny (01:28:34):
Amazing. And then how can listeners be useful to you? Just check out those things.

April Dunford (01:28:37):
I guess so. You know what? I'm in this phase. I think, again, I think it's an old age thing. I am in this kind of philosophical phase where I'm not going to be doing this forever. And what I'm trying to do right now is get everything that's useful out of my head and out in the world before I'm done. And so right now I'm very focused on delivering useful things for other people. I didn't think I needed to write a book about sales pitches, but then I got the idea in my head, everybody's sales pitch is so bad and there isn't a book on how to build a sales pitch. And I'm not saying mine's the world's greatest thing, but it's better than nothing. So this is what I'm trying to do right now. I'm trying to be useful to other people because pretty soon I'm not going to be doing anything, I think is the idea.

Lenny (01:29:29):
Arnold Schwarzenegger's new book is called Be Useful. And I feel like that's the perfect description of how to be successful and especially in the work that we do, just helping people. But I keep coming back to that. It's just be useful.

April Dunford (01:29:41):
I think this is a really important thing. When I wrote the first book, people started writing back to me and saying, "Oh, your book was so great." And my reflex action was to say, "Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it." But then I stumped myself and I was like, you know what? I don't actually care if you enjoyed it. This isn't entertainment. I'm actually trying to create something that's useful. So what I really want is for people to read this stuff and come back and say, "That was useful. We were struggling with this thing, and that unlocked something for me and that was useful." And that's what I'm trying to do right now.

Lenny (01:30:11):
April, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing.

April Dunford (01:30:14):
Thanks so much. It's always good to be here.

Lenny (01:30:17):
Always good to have you here. And we might do a V3 when you do a third book if you ever-

April Dunford (01:30:21):
No, not happening.

Lenny (01:30:25):

# How to nail your product positioning | April Dunford (Obviously Awesome)

## Transcript

April Dunford (00:00:00):
40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it." Because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:00:39):
Today. My guest is April Dunford. April is the world's foremost authority on product positioning. She's the author of the bestselling book, Obviously Awesome, which is my favorite book on positioning. And this is her second time on the podcast because she just published a new book called Sales Pitch, which builds on her 25-year career as VP of marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games and many others. The book guides you through a better way to pitch and sell your product. And in our conversation, April shares the framework that she has seen work most often in getting potential customers to get excited about your product and to decide to buy your product.

(00:01:16):
Like I say, at the top of this episode, you'll become better at pitching and selling your product by the end of this episode. And if that's useful to you, which it should be, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you April Dunford after a short word from our sponsors.

Speaker 1 (00:01:32):

Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, click up, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:03:04):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:03:47):
April, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast.

April Dunford (00:03:52):
So great to be back. We were talking about this earlier, but it feels like it was so long ago when I did the last one. I was one of the first guests and I feel like, man, you've been running this thing forever. And that was like a year ago.

Lenny (00:04:05):
It feels like a lifetime, but it was about a year ago.

April Dunford (00:04:08):
But what you've done with it is amazing, right? The growth in it, everything else, it's super inspirational.

Lenny (00:04:13):
Thanks April. I appreciate that.

April Dunford (00:04:15):
You're welcome. It's true though. I think everybody looks at your stuff and goes, "What the heck? How does he do it?"

Lenny (00:04:22):
The secret is a lot of work.

April Dunford (00:04:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:04:24):
That's the get rich quick scheme there.

April Dunford (00:04:28):
Nobody wants to hear that.

Lenny (00:04:30):
Yeah. But it's work that's extremely fulfilling and we get to chat again and you are a very rare return guest, which makes me very happy. And the reason you're back is you've written an incredible new book, which I have right here if you're on YouTube called Sales Pitch.

April Dunford (00:04:44):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:04:45):
There it is. And it's in your background, too. It's like a inception. The book is called Sales Pitch, How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win. And we're going to be spending our time today digging into all of the lessons and frameworks in the book as much as we can in the hour that we have. And my goal for this conversation is for listeners to leave this podcast with better skills at pitching and selling their product. Which I think every product leader and founder will want to do and get better at. How does that sound?

April Dunford (00:05:13):
That sounds great.

Lenny (00:05:14):
Okay, sweet. I was thinking as a way to get into the conversation, we start with maybe a story or an example of a company that you worked with where you applied the frameworks and lessons they teach in the book. And then use that as kind of a jumping off point for digging in further.

April Dunford (00:05:30):
Yeah, sure. So my background is, I do positioning work. And so in the work that I do with clients, generally what we're working on is a shift in the positioning, which is a little bit of a shift in our thinking around, how do we win in the market? So in order to test that positioning, what we want to do is take the positioning and translate it into a sales pitch and then test it live with prospects.

(00:05:53):
And one of the things I noticed right at the beginning of doing this work is that everybody's sales pitch kind of looked the same and they weren't all that great. And for the most part what was happening in the sales pitch is there was no positioning going on in the sales pitch at all. The sales pitch was essentially a product exposition, so essentially a glorified product box room. If there was five dropdown menus, we're going to click on all five dropdown menus and show everybody everything just feature, feature, feature, feature, feature.

(00:06:24):
And so, most of the teams weren't used to doing any kind of pitching in the pitch really. It was just the facts Jack, were just going to show you that. Some would do this really lightweight thing. Here's the problem, we're the solution. Now let me walk you through all the dropdown menus, but it is basically the same thing like that.

(00:06:43):
And so what I wanted to do was build a pitch structure that would reflect the positioning. And so in order to do that, we have to get a little bit into storytelling mode. Not a lot, but at least a little. And when we're talking about features, we shouldn't be talking about features. We should be talking about the value that the features deliver.

(00:07:01):
So let me give you an example and I'll do before and after what this would look like. So I work with these folks, Help Scout, and so they're in the customer service space, so think Zendesk or whatever. They're in that space. And what's interesting about them is they were built from the ground up to serve digital businesses. So businesses that don't have a physical store, they don't have sales reps. And so their approach to customer service was different from the outset. Help Scout said, "Well, you know what? Customer service for that kind of business is really important. It's the only time you ever get to interact with actual customers." And so the data shows that if you give them a really great interaction in service, it improves loyalty, it improves repeat purchases, and it's actually a growth driver. Now, most folks in other industries see customer service as a cost center.

(00:07:49):
So your telephone company for example, wants to get you off the phone as fast as possible. And they want to push you to the self-serve FAQ channels, and they don't care about giving you a good service at all. They don't care about any of that. And so they're all about driving the cost down. So if we look at Help Scout in their positioning, the alternatives to Help Scout are a handful of things. Most folks start using a shared inbox and it's really easy to use and the reps love it. It's easy to use. The problem is, is you start growing and then you want customer service features. You want to be able to do assignments and prioritization and things like that. So then these customers end up upgrading to help desk software and now they're in this whole different world.

(00:08:31):
So the first thing is really hard to use. So we're not in shared inbox territory anymore. And the second thing is that there's this attitude of we're trying to push folks to low cost channels. We don't really care about them. We're going to assign you a ticket number. You're not a person anymore. All this stuff. So that's the situation. So Help Scout, if they did a typical pitch the way I see most SaaS companies pitch, they would just expose the features. Right? So the pitch would look like this. Digital business comes in and they say, "Hi, Help Scout, let me show you how to log in, let me show you all the features. Look, there's a shared inbox thing there that's really great. Oh, look, we can do assignments and prioritization and we can do this other thing and we can do this other thing and la, la la." And I keep going until the time runs out and I don't have any more features to talk about.

(00:09:20):
The problem with that pitch is the customer's sitting there going, "I don't know, man, that sounds a little bit like my shared inbox, but it also sounds like help desk software. Is it different than help desk software? I'm not so sure. And there's overlap in the features there." And so it doesn't really answer the question, why pick us over the other guys?

(00:09:42):
And so a different style of pitch would be one, we would do a little bit of setup to give everybody an idea about how we fit amongst all the other solutions and what our point of view is in the market. And then when we get to exploring the features, we would do that within the context of the differentiated value. So here's how that pitch would look like. Customer comes in and Help Scout says, "Hey, digital business, we work with a lot of companies like you, and I'm going to show you the product. But before we get there, one of the things we think is interesting is that digital businesses look at customer service differently. They look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center. And so most of the folks we work with see delivering a really amazing experience as a key part of customer service. Would you agree with that?"

(00:10:26):
Yeah, we would. They have a little conversation and then they say, "Great. We you have choices here. So most of the folks we work with start with a shared inbox, and that's great because it's really easy, really easy to use all that stuff. The problem is if you're growing and you probably are, then you're going to outgrow that because you're going to need prioritizations assignments, help desk stuff.

(00:10:45):
And so then your option is to go to help desk software. And so help desk software is great, does all the things. The problem is that it was not designed for businesses like you. It was designed for businesses that want to take the cost out of customer service. So it's going to do some things that are weird. It's going assign your customers a ticket number and it's going to try to drive them to low cost channels. So can we agree that in a perfect world for digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk, but had all the bells and whistles so we wouldn't have to migrate to something else. And on top of that was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service. Do we agree we want that?"

(00:11:26):
Now, at that point, the customer is either with you or you're not. But if they are, then we switch to the actual demo part. If we do a demo and then we say, "Great, we've got those three things. Let me show you how that works. So one as easy to use an inbox. Look, here's the inbox. It's easy to use. Looks just like an inbox. It's amazing. Two, features, so you never have to outgrow it. Look, here's how we do prioritizations assignments, whatever. We can do all the stuff you need as you grow, and you're never going to have to switch platforms. And then last one, deliver an amazing experience. Look, the customer gets to choose which channel that they interact with you with. And look, they get to stay Dave and not ticket number 1479."

(00:12:02):
That sort of thing. So that's how the pitch looks in the after. But that's a really different pitch. That pitch is designed to answer the question, "Why pick us over the other folks?" And so as you might imagine, it is a lot more effective at actually getting clients to get their head around, what is this thing? Why is it different? Why should I pick you? And it just works way better in a sales situation.

Lenny (00:12:22):
Awesome. So just to maybe summarize the framework 'cause you went through each of these pieces, and I think it might be helpful to give people the kind of steps. And I have them here, but maybe it might be better for you to kind work through.

April Dunford (00:12:33):
So you can think of it is... So first of all, the pitch structure has two big pieces. So the first is the setup. The setup piece is not about us, it's about the market, our point of view on the market. The second bit is all about our differentiated value. So why pick us over the other guys? So those pieces aren't equal. In a normal sales pitch situation, we don't want to spend all day in the setup part. We want to get to the meat, which is our differentiated value, but we can't skip that bit. So if I've got a half hour call or a 45-minute call, maybe I spend a few minutes on this upfront, this upfront stuff is really important though.

(00:13:12):
And we could break the upfront into three pieces. So it starts with our insight into the market. So you can think of this as our point of view on the market or kind of like the problem inside the problem, in some ways. So in Help Scout's case, the insight is, " Hey, customer service is just different for digital businesses, and this is really a growth driver, not a cost center. So we need to think about customer service in a different way." That's their insight. So we start with that.

(00:13:41):
The second piece is pluses and minuses of alternative solutions. What we want to do is paint a picture of the entire market and talk about what's good and bad of the other ways of approaching the job. And then out of that conversation, we have a conclusion, which is what I call perfect world. But just kind of like can we agree that if we really wanted to solve this problem and knowing what works and doesn't work in the alternate solutions, can we agree really good solutions should tick these boxes? This is getting the customer aligned with your worldview.

(00:14:14):
If they're aligned, then we switch to the follow through. The follow through has a handful of steps, but the main step is this differentiated value step. So usually what we'd start with is an introduction. "Hey, we're Help Scout. We do customer service stuff specifically for digital businesses." And then we would move on to, "Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it."

(00:14:37):
We generally end the sales pitch with a couple of little steps. So one is after we talk about the value, generally there's a step for proof, which is how can we prove that we do what we say we could do. Which is often a customer case study or it might be independent third party verification on stuff. But usually there's a proof step. There's an optional step after that, which is handling objections that haven't come up during the call. So sometimes we'll have a silent objection, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it sounds really hard to adopt." Or, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it's probably pretty expensive." Or, "Yeah, that's okay, but it probably doesn't meet our needs for security or whatever."

(00:15:15):
And so we handle that at the end in this special objection step. And then we end the pitch with what I call the ask, which is whatever we want the customer to do next. So it could be just asking for the sale or it could be, "Hey, we want to do a proof of concept. Who do we need to talk to about that?" Or, "Hey, we're going to do a project. Who needs to be involved in defining the project?" Whatever the next step is in your sales process. That's how we end is with dask.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Cool. I wanted to actually talk about objections. 'Cause I imagine going through this, companies often don't agree with what you're saying, and I wonder how you handle that. So you're going in this, do you agree? And yeah, the silent objection is really interesting. I don't even think about that, where they're just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we agree." But they don't really agree. How would you suggest people handle them being like, "No, I don't actually see the world that way." Or the silent objection, which I guess is something you save for the end.

April Dunford (00:16:09):
Typically when we're starting with insight, our insight into the market, if we're doing this well, the insight is generally not all that controversial. So you could think of it this way. So it's kind of the reason you built what you built. So most founders, when you talk to them, they didn't just come up with the idea out of nowhere. They woke up in the morning and said, "You know what sucks about email, this thing sucks about email. And so I'm going to build this different kind of email that solves that problem." Or in the case of Help Scout, it's like, do you know what sucks about customer service? It just wasn't built for these kinds of businesses.

(00:16:44):
And so if you've got a point of view on the world and you're talking to a customer that just fundamentally doesn't agree with that... In the case of a Help Scout, they come in and they say, "No, actually it's a cost center for us. We're just trying to get the cost down." They should disqualify that deal because they can't serve that customer better than Zendesk does. Zendesk is going to win that deal. But if you've done this properly, your insight should resonate for the target account that you're trying to go after. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be other objections, and usually there's all kinds of other objections. But the objections are more on a level of, if I can get you hooked at the beginning in this setup, then we go to the value, which is just proving I can do what we already agreed we wanted to get done. Then the objections tend to be more like operational stuff. "Yeah, this sounds good, but I don't know if we can forward it." Or "This sounds good, but boy, we're going to have to migrate off the old thing or whatever."

(00:17:40):
So mentally they're kind of sold already, but they're worried about, "Well, what's IT going to say? And can I actually get budget about this?" And in B2B, we've got this network of people that we've got to go get agreement from to move forward on this thing. And so often there's objections around that. The beginning of the sales pitch thing... One more thing on that is that part of what we're doing in that setup is what salespeople would call discovery. And so that setup part should not be me talking at you. It should be a conversation between me and the client saying, "Do you agree with this? Is this what you're seeing? Did you start with a shared inbox? What are you doing right now? Did you ever consider using help desk software? Why yes, why no? Do you have any constraints on what you're looking at? What have you tried before? What are you looking at trying right now?"

(00:18:31):
This is part of the discovery that we do in a first substantive sales call that your sales reps would know how to do this. Typically, one of the things we don't have in the pitch decks that I see in SaaS companies is there's no good place to do this discovery. So it kind of happens outside of the structure of the pitch. In this pitch structure, there's a definite spot for discovery. So by the time we get to the end of the setup, we should either be aligned like, "Yep, this looks like a good prospect for us. Yep, we can do something. Yep, they got a problem we can solve. This all looks good." Or we kind of jointly come to the conclusion, "Hey, this just... Our stuff just ain't for you, man." And that's it.

Lenny (00:19:13):
I mentioned a lot of this comes from doing this enough times. You get to understand where people generally agree, this is a problem. We all know this is our problem. And it's unlikely that you're going to have to throw everything out because someone just decides, "No, this isn't for us."

(00:19:29):
I think one of the biggest shift maybe from this framework is that you go into a teaching mindset. It's not just like, "Here's our product, it's going to solve your problem." It's more, "Here's what's happening broadly. Maybe you don't have the time to do the research we've done. Here's what we found." And then that builds trust, I think in you as a company and as a leader, a salesperson. And then they're like, "Okay, see, they see the world the way we do." Or, "I've just realized something new. I never thought of it that way." And then, "Okay, cool. How do they think about the solution to this?"

April Dunford (00:19:57):
Right. One of the key things to think about in all of this stuff that I think we don't think about enough as software vendors is that customers will come to us and they've done their homework. They've Googled around and they've looked at stuff, but that doesn't mean they have perfect understanding of the market. In fact, it's usually far from it. If we think about it, most of the folks in B2B software, most of the time, your buyer has never purchased software like yours before. This is the first time they've done it. And their bosses come to them and said, "Hey, figure this out. Go find us a CRM and look at all the CRMs and figure it out."

(00:20:33):
And the buyers looking at it going, "Geez, I don't know, man. There's a lot of CRMs out there, and I'm looking at all the things. I'm on G2 Crowd and there's 24 CRMs in the top right corner. And I'm looking at Gardner Group and I'm looking at this thing and I'm actually doing my research, but I'm overwhelmed. What I don't have is a clear picture of the market. What are the different approaches to this problem? Forget about products. What are the approaches to the problem? Where do the products fit in those approaches? What's a good solution for me look like? What should be my purchase criteria?" That's really hard for buyers to figure out.

(00:21:10):
And in general, in a sales process, we're not doing anything to help the buyer figure that out, even though we know it. We eat, sleep and breathe this market. We spend all day looking at competitors and thinking about this stuff and whatever. But we've got this idea, "Well, we shouldn't do this because first of all, we can't talk about the other guys that we'd be seen as bashing our competition, and that's bad." The other thing is, even if we did give our opinion, nobody would trust us because we're biased. But if you look at the research on this stuff, the research doesn't support that. The research actually says what B2B software buyers want in a sales interaction is perspectives on the market and help weighing their options. And we don't do that. We're just like, "Here's our stuff. You figure it out, it's up to you. You figure it out."

(00:22:03):
And so as a result, what we get are these buyers come in, they're overwhelmed with all this information. They come in and they sit in our sales process, and we overwhelm them even more with more features and more information. And what they're really worried about is, "What if I make a bad choice here? I've never done this before and I'm going to have to recommend to my boss. And if I make the wrong suggestion to my boss, maybe my boss thinks I'm stupid. Or maybe I buy something and the whole department hates me because awful to use. Or maybe I pick something and it's just bad software and then bad things happen for the business, maybe I get fired."

(00:22:40):
And so the data on this shows that for B2B, 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. And then when you look at, if you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of the...

April Dunford (00:23:00):
The old thing we were doing is better, that's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it," because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:23:23):
I think this is one of the most interesting insights that you share in your book and you also share this in the newsletter post about how buying software you could argue is harder than selling it because people will have learned there's skills and training for selling, but buying is, as you described, extremely stressful. Basically your job's on the line if you make a mistake. Is there anything more you can share along those lines just to help reinforce that buying software is extremely hard and stressful and people don't understand that?

April Dunford (00:23:50):
Once you get into that mindset, I think then you look at the situation a lot different. I think we've seen the statistics on this that says the buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying, "Nope, I'm not buying nothing." And in fact that's true 60% of the time. And so how do we combat that? The way we combat that is not just talking about ourselves, it's actually about trying to be helpful to that person in this very stressful situation that is trying to figure out how do I make a really good decision.

(00:24:27):
So what we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, "Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us. And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets." And so you can just think of it that way. So you don't need to know every single feature, every single thing. I'm giving you a bigger picture of the whole market and helping you feel good. Well, if you choose this or you choose that, now you know why.

Lenny (00:24:57):
I think what's interesting about this is a lot of startups fail because they can't convince anyone to switch from the status quo. And I think people always think of that as the current product is good enough and that's why they're losing, but I think this adds an additional wrinkle of it's also the person buying it is just like, "I don't want to add the stress to even decide and make the choice and put my butt on the line to switch." And I never thought of it that way.

April Dunford (00:25:22):
I think that hurdle is a lot more than you think. So we obviously have to compete with status quo, we can't ignore status quo, because sometimes status quo just is good enough and so we can't ignore that. We still lose deals to status quo, but we lose an awful lot of deals to just plain customer indecision, customers being more afraid of screwing up than missing out.

Lenny (00:25:46):
So to try to overcome that, to drill into the things you find most powerful, one is help the customer understand the bigger picture and why essentially they're falling behind, why maybe competition is going to have an advantage because they're thinking in a different way.

April Dunford (00:26:04):
Well, I'll throw something out about that.

Lenny (00:26:06):
Please.

April Dunford (00:26:10):
And I've heard people talk about this a lot that one of the things we could do in this situation when a customer is feeling this indecision is to lean into this FOMO and say, "Look, you're missing out. The competitors are all doing it and you're not doing it." And so this is an interesting question. And so I was super excited, Matt Dixon wrote this book called The JOLT Effect, and in that they studied two and a half million sales calls, they recorded on Gong and they studied it with AI, and then they looked at what happened after the sales call, so were these successful or not successful, did a deal happen or whatever. It's pretty rare that we get a chance to dig into some data like this.

(00:26:49):
And so what his data showed is if a customer is indecisive, throwing FOMO into the mix makes it worse. So they're less likely to close the deal if you throw that in. And the idea is that they're already stressed out and you're just putting more stress on them by pressuring them, by saying, "Oh, this is happening, bad things are going to..." You're like, "Bad things will happen if I do something, bad things happen if I don't do something, what do I do?"

Lenny (00:27:22):
They just put their head in the sand, right? They're just like, "Ah, forget it."?

April Dunford (00:27:24):
So they're just like, "Forget it, I'm doing nothing. Now I'm totally paralyzed." And so there's an assumption that companies are very motivated by this FOMO thing, but I think that that is not always true, and if the customer is actually indecisive, throwing in this FOMO thing isn't going to do it. So what does work in that situation is, one, giving them the tools to make the decision. So that includes paint the picture of the market, teaching them how to buy essentially. So teaching them, look, for customers like you, you just have to worry about these three, four things, and all this other stuff, it doesn't apply to you. That applies to bigger companies, that applies to whatever, so this idea of teaching a customer how to buy is one way to take that stress down.

(00:28:08):
And then there's a whole bunch of other techniques you can use. So one is if it's a really big deal, we can split it into smaller pieces, we can do things like offer you a money back guarantee, we can do things like sometimes we have services and support that are going to help you if things go bad and this is how we're going to make sure. So this idea of being able to take risk off the table is a really serious one if we've got a customer that is actually paralyzed because of this indecision thing.

Lenny (00:28:36):
That makes a lot of sense, basically it's like how do we help the buyer cover their ass if they made a mistake, because what you're saying is that's the main reason they're not buying your product.

April Dunford (00:28:43):
And this FOMO thing is just not going to do it.

Lenny (00:28:43):
That's so interesting. So I really like this framework. I wrote this down, teaching them how to buy, that is a really simple way of just thinking about this whole process.

April Dunford (00:28:53):
Well, it's funny, I was having this conversation with Bob Moesta, he did Jobs To Be Done.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Yeah, I watched that episode.

April Dunford (00:29:00):
So he's just the best. And so one of the things I think of is normally when we come at this we're like, "Well, how can we convince the customer that we do the job that they need to have done?" And obviously we need to do that, but there is this secondary job that the champion of the deal is, and that's how do I make a decision without getting fired? And so we got to help them accomplish that job, otherwise we don't get what we want, which is the money.

Lenny (00:29:28):
It's so interesting. And it's not even necessarily get fired, it's even the performance sufferers or they don't get the promotion, it's did they do a good job. This makes me think of a process at Airbnb we went through to buy community forum software and I just remember these massive teams of salespeople come to the office and pitching everyone on the software and they just keep pushing you to make what's the next step here, who do we need to roll in, who needs to buy into it? And it's just like, "Oh my God, it's so stressful. I have to keep this thing moving." And then there's IT coming in like, "Oh, we got to make sure it integrates with Salesforce." And you start with I just wanted the best community forum software because we were trying to build something really different and unique and you end up with like, "Okay, it's fine, just go with the thing that works with Salesforce. It's all good. I'm just going to move on to another process."

April Dunford (00:30:15):
Well, this is the thing, it's so easy to default to the market leader in that situation. The market leader has this big advantage that you can say, "You know what? Who's going to get me in trouble for picking Salesforce? Nobody." It's so easy to just flip back on that. And so if you're the challenger in this situation, the brand that's number two or number three, you've got to get over all of this inertia and tilting towards the status quo, because it's just so easy, it's the lowest risk decision, besides do nothing is to just pick the leader in the market and we'll just run with that.

Lenny (00:30:49):
I think the classic phrase was no one gets fired for buying Microsoft. I wonder is it Salesforce now that's the default version of that now?

April Dunford (00:30:55):
Yeah, the original one was IBM. [inaudible 00:30:57]

Lenny (00:30:56):
I think you're right. Oh, man.

April Dunford (00:30:59):
Now you totally get fired for buying IBM. I don't know what happens. The other thing you bring up is I think an interesting thing to think about too that really messes people up in these situations is that in B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen and so there's this complexity we don't have a consumer, but a lot of people I think overcomplicate that. In a typical B2B purchase process, we've got someone in that buying team is what we would call the champion. So that person is the person who's been tasked with, hey, pick us the accounting software or pick us the CRM, you figure it out. And so that person is the person that does the initial research, makes the short list, probably sits on the first calls, and then there's all these other people.

(00:31:49):
Now, the other people can't make a deal happen, but they can kill it a thousand ways. So the way this works is your positioning and your pitch needs to really work for the champion, because if it doesn't, you don't even get to talk to anybody else, you don't even get to go near anybody else if you don't make it out of the shortlist and you don't get the deal cooking. But once the deal is cooking it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups. So if you're the line of business buyer, let's say you're in the sales department and you're buying a CRM, IT is going to have to get involved at some point, and IT doesn't really care about the value of your CRM, but they do care does it meet the security requirements and does it integrate with the stuff we already have and how much of a pain is this thing going to be to manage, and so we're not actually pitching value to those people, we're just handling objections.

(00:32:46):
And so once we realize that, then we can get really tight on our positioning in our sales pitch. What we're really trying to do is just cook the champion, get the champion, and then once the deal's going we got to arm the champion for how to handle all these objections of all these other groups so that you can get a consensus to get a deal moving forward.

Lenny (00:33:05):
How do you actually do that? Is it ask them what are all the concerns you're hearing? Is it ask the individual stakeholders what your biggest concern is?

April Dunford (00:33:11):
Well, if we're really smart, we already know because we've done lots of deals. So if we're being a good partner in this, sometimes even in the very first meeting in that spot where we're talking about objectives, we're going to say, "Hey, look, IT is going to come in and they're going to be worried about this, this, and this, and don't worry, we got you."

(00:33:32):
So we're SOC 2 compliant, we do this, we do that, we know because we've done 15 deals and we know what these deals are like and we know what the stuff is going to be. You might have the champion come in and say, "Well, I don't know, end users might not like it." And it's like, "Okay, well, here's how we're going to get your end users on board, this is the training we have, this is the stuff we're going to do." The neat thing, if you have a product like [inaudible 00:33:54] on the front end of that, it takes that objection off the table. And you might have other things like you're going to take this to your boss and they're going to want to know ROI numbers, blah, blah, blah, and we've already done that, look, here's our calculator, if you give us this information, we can put this in, here's how you sell your boss.

(00:34:12):
So that's what we're doing. We're trying to arm them because we've done a million deals, they've never bought software like this before. So half the time you'll be doing deals and they don't even know what the purchase process is. And so if we're being good partners, we're like, "Okay, does this need to go to purchasing?" And they'll say, "Yeah, it probably does." Oh, well, here's what typically happens at purchasing. They're going to do this, this, this, and we're going to give you this stuff and that's going to help you get it through purchasing.

Lenny (00:34:40):
The way you're describing it now makes it feel like you need to be a big company for this to be useful because smaller companies don't have all these reps and they may not have the resources to do all these things you're describing. Who is this framework useful for? Can you use this approach if you're just, say, an early stage B2B?

April Dunford (00:34:53):
Well, so it's B2B products. If you don't have a sales team, I still think you can use this structure to build a story that marketing can use and you can use in different ways, and we can talk about that. But in the companies that I work with, they're B2B, they've got a sales team, and so the immediate thing we're doing is we're making a shift in positioning, we're building a sales pitch that reflects that positioning, we can immediately implement that in sales even though it's going to take a while for us to forklift the messaging and do other stuff and change our campaigns and everything else to match this new positioning, but we can tighten up the sales pitch and have an immediate impact over in sales on that. Second thing is that I've worked with tons of companies where the founder is the only sales rep and this works pretty good for that.

(00:35:39):
I don't think we need a ton of resources to do it, but I do think we need to have enough traction in the market that we understand how a deal typically goes. So if we haven't sold anything yet then we don't know yet, it's hard for us to help you buy something if we don't even know how to sell it. But if I've done 10 deals, I know what happens, I got a pretty good guess of what IT is going to say when you try to implement this stuff, I have a good guess of what's going to happen when we go to roll it out, I have a pretty good guess of what your boss might object to or might get excited by. And so I don't necessarily need a research team to go figure this out. This is just me trying to be helpful and help the champion do their job of getting this deal to the finish line.

Lenny (00:36:23):
So maybe the MVP of this approach is a deck that you continue iterating and adjust and restructure, and also bullet points of things you want to bring up like, "Okay, cool, IT is going to ask for these things," a few bullet points that you keep track of.

April Dunford (00:36:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I'm also thinking from the perspective of a product team building a product, they don't really sell it themselves. They work with sales, they work with marketing. Is there anything that you would recommend or that you think product teams could learn from this approach of selling that would help them build products in a different way or work with sales in a different way?

April Dunford (00:36:59):
Yeah. So here's what I think, the core of a good sales pitch is really deeply understanding your differentiated value, which is what is the value I can deliver that no other solution can. Often what I see at companies is you got a smart product team and they know a lot about the stuff they're building and why it's important and what the value is to the customer, and they did all this work on that when they were building it, but that information never made the jump to sales, because sales isn't even trying to pitch value. They're just pitching features like here's the dropdown menus, here's what they do. And so the first step in fixing this I think is to have a cross-functional team work on positioning.

(00:37:43):
So if I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product, deeply understand what's differentiated about it, deeply understands value, and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are, what the champion really wants to get done and doesn't want to get done, what the situation is in a typical account, and then all of this cool information sharing happens, which actually you end up with way better definition of your differentiated value in the first place.

(00:38:22):
And so once we've done that work, it is very natural then for us to work together on the sales pitch that reflects that. What typically happens is not that at all. What typically happens is product's working on some stuff, sales is working on some stuff, marketing's working on some stuff. Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, "I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see," and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.

Lenny (00:38:57):
That's a long time. So first podcast episode was all around positioning, and so folks want to get deep into that, they should listen to that, so we're not going to spend tons of time there, but differentiated value is a big part of this process also so I think it's worth spending a bit of time here. Could you maybe share a couple examples of what this is to give people a sense of what does it mean to share differentiated value?

April Dunford (00:39:20):
Yeah. So differentiated value is the answer to the question why pick us over the other alternatives? And so the way we get at that in positioning is we start with putting a stake in the ground of who do we actually compete with? And so if we didn't exist in the market, what would a customer do? And so typically there's some status quo thing, it might not even look like you, it might just be a spreadsheet, or do it with the intern or manual labor, and then there's whatever else ends up on a short list against us. And it's basically the definition of I got to beat all this plus indecision in order to win a deal, so I can stick my stake in the ground. Sales knows the answer to this question. If you have a sales team, they know the answer to this question, what would a customer do if we didn't exist, they know.

(00:40:06):
And then we get to the next step is, well, so what do we have that's different? And that's capability wise, feature function of the product or capability of the company, so it could be features, it could be your pricing model, it could be we have support in a way that the other folks don't. So there's all kinds of things it could be. It could be be the breadth of the portfolio that you have beyond that one product, we can fill whiteboards with this stuff. And then what we do is we go down that list of features and we say, "So what? You got advanced AI, whatever the heck the thing is, so what? Why does anybody care?" And the answer to that so what is your value. And because it came from this differentiated feature, it's generally value that the other guys can't deliver because they don't have the capabilities that underpin it.

(00:40:53):
So if I give you an example, a company I worked with a few years back, they've recently been acquired by Salesforce called LevelJump, and so they're in the sales enablement space, which is terrible. There's a million companies in the sales enablement space and they all look the same. And so LevelJump, so if you look at, well, what's the competitive alternatives, if I look at all the companies in the sales enablement space, you can put them into two buckets in terms of approaches, they're either a CMS like a jazzy content repository where you could make sure that people are using the right content and whatever, or they're an LMS, a learning management system, which I can build the course and certify you on the course, and that's how we're going to train the sales reps.

(00:41:39):
If you look at LevelJump, they're differentiated capability is they're the only one that's built on top of Salesforce. That's the feature, we're built on Salesforce, the other folks aren't. And then who cares? So what? And so when we first had a conversation about it, there was five or six different answers to that so what question, but the big answer was, well, because we're built on top of Salesforce, my sales enablement data is integrated with my sales data. And then you say, "Well, so what about that?" Well, because then that means I can actually tell did the sales enablement improve time to first deal or improve time to make quota? Well, so what about that? Well, if I improve that ramp time, then we get way more revenue faster. So that's the differentiated value.

(00:42:29):
When I go to do that in a sales pitch, I can translate that into my insight. My insight is every day your rep's not making [inaudible 00:42:36] it costs you money. So if we really want to solve sales enablement, don't we really want to have something where we can measure whether or not the sales enablement is working with sales metrics? Yeah, we do.

Lenny (00:42:47):
Interesting. So the differentiated value often informs the insight that you start with?

April Dunford (00:42:52):
It does. It absolutely is. The insight is basically the context that makes your differentiated value important, what is the thing you need to know to understand the importance of my differentiated value? In the case of Help Scout, the insight is, look, digital businesses like customer service is a growth driver, where does that come from? If you look at their differentiated value, it's there. And so we can just reverse it, flip it around. Even if the product wasn't necessarily constructed with that insight, maybe we got there sideways or the roundabout way or whatever, we iterated our way into that. We can look at the differentiated value and then basically reverse it out to the insight.

Lenny (00:43:33):
What's a sign that the differentiated value or insight that you've come up with just isn't clicking?

April Dunford (00:43:37):
If the differentiated value doesn't work in a sales pitch, what you'll get is the company going, "Why would I pay for that? This is not value for me, buddy." The companies I work with, the way I look at it is if you're in market and you're selling and you have happy, engaged customers, there's differentiated value there. That's why they picked you. That's why they love you. That's why they don't turn out on you. It's there. You might not know what it is, we might have to do a little process to get at it, but it's there and it exists.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Awesome. Another question that's been in the back of my mind since we started talking about differentiated values is just how honest should you be about the competition? Obviously there's a spectrum of extremely honest to super biased, what's your guidance on just how honest to be there?

April Dunford (00:44:34):
The posture I think you should assume in a sales situation, I had an old boss used to talk about this, is the posture we should have is calm confidence. So where that calm confidence comes from is we really understand why people should pick us. So this is differentiated value, we really understand it and we really understand who that's a really good fit for, and we don't even bother trying to chase anybody else.

(00:45:03):
So we should be able to come in and say, "Look, we're sales enablement that delivers results. If you don't care about those results, you shouldn't pick us. You should pick someone else." And so generally what we're trying to be is extremely honest. We're trying to come in and actually give credit where credit is due with the other approaches, because typically the other approaches work just fine for other kinds of companies. If you're really small and you're not growing e-commerce business, use a shared inbox. It's free, it's easy to use, there's no problems there, just use it. If you're really worried about bringing the cost down in a customer service center, maybe you should use Zendesk. And so I think the more we can act as a guide in this situation and come in and say, "Look, these guys are good for this, these folks are good for this, and we're good for this. And you might not care about that, and if you don't care about that, we're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us." But I think that...

April Dunford (00:46:00):
We're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us. But I think that this calm confidence idea is that where we know the client should pick us, we should be unafraid to fight for that business. But we should totally walk away from business where we're not the best fit. We shouldn't be chasing that business at all.

Lenny (00:46:20):
And this comes back to teaching them how to buy again and again. For these cases where you're like, "This is not a fit." Ideally you know that before you fly to their office and pitch them.

April Dunford (00:46:29):
Yeah, generally you've had some kind of qualification happen upstream, and so that qualification could be done in lots of different ways. If you've got some kind of product like growth motion in the beginning, you're looking for signals in that. And if the signals aren't there, then you're not talking to them. And so if you've designed your signals right, then you already know there's intent there. You already know you're a fit. You already know stuff. The way a lot of companies do this is they'll have inside sales do a qualification call before they set up a first call with a sales rep. In that qualification call, you're trying to make sure is this the right person? Do they have a need that we can actually meet? Is this actually a good fit for what we do? And if they're not, they don't even make it to the call.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Mm-hmm. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B1B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q3, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.

(00:48:09):
Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:48:32):
Another question around this idea of differentiated value and just alternative approaches is there's a certain previous guest who was very big on creating a category being extremely important, and that potentially being the only way to build a legendary business. I know you have a different perspective on that because in theory if you go that direction, there's no alternative. It's like "We're the one." What's your take on that?

April Dunford (00:48:55):
Well, so here's a few things. So one, obviously creating a category is not the only way to create a legendary business because the vast majority of legendary businesses did not create the categories that they're in. So Google did not create search, Facebook did not create social network. There's so many of them. It's actually more of an exception to the rule that the company is creating a category than the other way around. So I think it's a bit disingenuous to say the only way. It is a way to build a big business, no question about that. But it's absolutely not the only way. In fact, it is not the most common way, but it is a way and it does work. So that's one thing. The second thing is that category creation is interesting. Like most companies, if you look at their arc, even the category creators that are successful, they did not start out as category creators.

(00:49:53):
So they started out as a niche play in an existing category, and that's because that's generally the easiest way to get traction for a company early because what is the job of the market category? The job of a market category is to help answer the question, what is this thing all about? If I'm positioning an existing category, I can say, "Well, I'm CRM for very small businesses." That was Salesforce's initial positioning. I didn't have to explain to you what a CRM was, that already existed. There was already billion dollar company in that space. We know what a CRM is, and I could say "We're CRM for very small businesses. The reason you can use in this very small businesses is we don't have any software. So you don't have to have an IT department to babysit it. It's fantastic."

(00:50:34):
So most companies start there. Now what happens is that if you become the dominant player in that space, which again, category creation folks talk about this like no category creator has ever lost the market. In fact, most category creators wins their market. Like what happened to MySpace? What happened to Ask Jeeves? It didn't work out so good for them. Most category creators actually get overtaken by fast followers. So if we look at the CRM market, Siebel was the big dominant player there and now they're not. So now we've got Salesforce. Once you're the dominant player in that market, a cool move to do is to actually extend the boundaries of the category so that you can continue to grow. And most of the category creation examples we see are companies that when they were 200, 300, 400 million revenue dominating their space, then decided to move the goalposts and say, "Well actually now we're expanding into all these other areas and we're going to call this category something. And that's what it is."

(00:51:38):
And there's loads of examples of that. Like Qualtrics for example, is a company that a lot of people talk about very successful category creation. Well, they were survey software up until there were 300 million revenue just like everybody else in an existing category. So that got them there and that worked just fine. Oh, well, once we're dominating it, now we can say it's whatever, it is, customer experience software, whatever it is. Snowflake. Another good example like data warehousing in the cloud, they were that data warehousing, an existing market, were data warehousing for the cloud. That is not category creation. And that took them all the way up to the point where they were about to go public and now they're cloud data, which is their attempt to expand and say, "Well, it's not just data warehousing, it's actually data lakes and all other data stuff."

(00:52:22):
And so that's a smart move for them because they're now very well known in that space. I'm not saying category creation is a bad thing. There are examples of company that came right out of the gate and successfully created a category and then survived to own the category longer term. But a more common thing that happens is that the company does the hard work of creating the category and in exactly the moment where the category starts to take hold, fast follower can come in with fresh funding and a lot of it and learn from all your mistakes and come in and knock you off the peak right when you think you've made it.

(00:53:01):
So I think category creation is, again, it's good, it works, but I think we have to be very careful when we're thinking about doing that at an early stage business or a business that isn't already dominating the category that they're in. It's much more common to see companies come in, shave off a piece of the market, dominate that, and then successfully branch out. It's what Jeffrey Moore called bowling pin strategy. Almost all successful companies follow bowling pin strategy.

Lenny (00:53:29):
Wait, what is that? Let's touch on that real quick.

April Dunford (00:53:31):
Oh yeah, you remember that thing. It's funny how many times I've talked about bowling pin strategy in the last two months. So this comes from a bunch of work that was done around the way innovation gets adopted, blah, blah. So there's a bunch of research done on this stuff, and I'm going to misquote it because Jeffrey Moore stuff, I've been reading it for decades. But bowling pin strategy goes like this. The easiest way to take over a great big market is to define a segment of the market that is underserved by the market leader.

(00:53:59):
And so if you think about a bunch of bowling pins, we're going to circle around the lead pin, which is this little piece of the market that's easy for us to go get, and the market leader probably doesn't care about it. And so we knock over that pin and knocking over that pin enables us to get to the three pins right beside it. And so now I'm established here as a beachhead and I can go get the next three pins, I'm going to knock those over, and eventually I get big enough to challenge the market leader and then I overtake them.

(00:54:28):
So the example for my early career was I worked at this company, we thought we were enterprise software. We narrowed it down to CRM for investment banks, and so we literally drew bowling pins for our investors and said, "Lead pin is CRM for investment banks. Once we knock that over, then we're going to go to retail banking, then we're going to be CRM for banking. And then once we knock that over, we're going to go to insurance, then we're going to be CRM for financial services. Once we knock that over, then we're going to be a great big company and we're going to challenge Siebel to be CRM for enterprise software." Instead we got acquired by Siebel for like $1 billion, but whatever. So most companies, if you look at the history of them, they actually start that way. And so yeah, if we just fast forwarded to when they were 300 million, we can say "Category creation's the only thing to do," but it's like, well, what happened before then? That was something different.

Lenny (00:55:21):
Awesome. Let's come back to your framework. I'm looking at the list of bullet points. So we've covered a lot of this already actually. So there's the insight where you helped them understand what's happening in the world and what's changing and why this is important. Then you talk about what the alternative approaches might be, pros and cons. Then there's this third step, which we haven't talked about yet, which is sharing the perfect world characteristics of a perfect solution. Can you talk a bit about that and why that's important?

April Dunford (00:55:47):
So this is the conclusion of the setup phase. So if I'm Help Scout for example, the conclusion is we say, "Look, you really want customer success software that's as easy to use as an inbox. You're never going to outgrow it, but it was built from the ground up to be deliver an amazing service." And so it's this part of the pitch where we actually get agreement with the customer that we are aligned in terms of our point of view on the universe. So it's where I say, "Okay, we've had our little discussion about the pros and cons of the other alternatives," and we say, "So look, so are you with me, man? Can we all agree that a really good solution for you would have A, B and C?" And the customer is either like, "Yeah, right," or they're not. And so if they're right with you on this definition of the perfect world, then I've got you. I've already won the deal and I haven't even talked about us yet because the way I've set it up, I'm the only one that can deliver that.

(00:56:49):
So if you say, "Right," all I got to do is prove that I can do that and get you over the hurdle that it's possible for you to adopt it.

Lenny (00:56:59):
Sounds too easy.

April Dunford (00:57:01):
Yeah, I mean...

Lenny (00:57:02):
It's like you lure them in.

April Dunford (00:57:04):
If all of this was easy, Lenny we would be on a beach drinking out of a coconut.

Lenny (00:57:09):
Oh man, let's make it happen. Okay, so that's the setup. What do you call the second part again?

April Dunford (00:57:14):
It's the follow through-

Lenny (00:57:14):
The follow through.

April Dunford (00:57:15):
... which is really focused on differentiated value. So in the second part, the first step is usually we introduce our stuff, which is where the market category is important. So we come in and we say, "Okay, can we agree that a really good solution should tick these boxes? Yes. Okay, good. Now let's talk about us. Okay, so we believe that. That's why we build what we build."

(00:57:36):
So here I am, I'm Help Scout, we're customer service software for digital businesses or whatever our market category is. So we introduce it just to get people straight in their mind about what it is, and then we move to here's the value, here's how we do it. If we think about a typical sales call, like let's say a sales call is half an hour, 45 minutes, I would expect to spend more than half of the time in the sales call in this differentiated value phase. So if we're doing a demo, that's the demo, and we're saying, "Okay, step one, let me show you how we do this. So easy to use as an inbox. Here's the features. Never have to outgrow it, here's the features. Delivers amazing customer experience, here's the features." And so that's where we're getting to the meat of what you thought you were getting when you clicked on the button that said, "Give me a demo."

(00:58:25):
So that's what we're doing there. And then we end with these three little pieces. One is generally I got to show you some proof that I can do what I say I can do. So if I'm claiming this thing delivers an amazing customer experience, how do I prove that? Well, I can prove it by other customers saying it was amazing. That's one way to prove it. If I had some independent third party data that proved whatever I was claiming, I could show that there too. But a lot of times what we're doing is we're like, "Let me show you how this worked in a company that used our stuff. So this is what the before looked like. They did this thing, here's the after." And so customer case study is usually good way to do that, but there's usually a step called proof, which is, I showed you the value, now here's the proof that I can actually deliver on that value and it's not just me blowing smoke.

(00:59:16):
And then the step after that then is this optional objection step where they say, "Oh yeah, sounds good, but IT is never going to go for it," or "Sounds good, but maybe it's going to be too expensive," or something. And so you're going to handle that objection as best as you can. And then you finish with the ask, which is whatever the next step in your sales process is. So it's, "Hey, so what we have to do to get a deal cooking here, do we have to get IT involved? Does IT need to see it? Would you like us to come in and present with you with IT or do you want me to just help you work on some stuff for IT?" It's whatever your next step in the sales process is.

Lenny (00:59:56):
Awesome. So let me read through this just to have it also succinctly here in case people are taking notes or trying to remember the stuff. So there's the setup, there's the follow through. Within the setup, you have the insight, the alternative approaches, pros and cons, in the perfect world. And then you introduce your product, talk about the differentiated value, share the proof of why it works, potentially handle objections, silent objections, and then the ask of what comes next.

April Dunford (01:00:21):
That's right. That's it.

Lenny (01:00:22):
In terms of knowing if this is working and if your differentiated value works or if your insight works, do you have kind of a heuristic of a success rate that feels right? How often should this work for you to feel like "I think we have it?"

April Dunford (01:00:34):
Well, so generally if the sales pitch isn't working, it's because the positioning was weak.

(01:00:41):
And so companies that jumped straight to building the new sales pitch without going back and really making sure that they really nailed the differentiated value, who knows? Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. And a lot of times it doesn't, I think. And so in the work I do with my clients, we go all the way back to the beginning. So we go right back to let's work on the positioning first. Now, if I've got the smartest people from the company in the room and we've done enough deals that we are pretty knowledgeable about how customers buy and what they like and what they don't know. If I've got the senior executive team in the room and they've got a reasonable amount of customer experience, we can pretty much feel good that the positioning we come up with if we're following a process will be good.

(01:01:25):
Then it's just a matter of taking that positioning, mapping it to the sales pitch and then going to test it. So I think there's a bunch of things in testing that are really important. So one is we absolutely need sales involved in building the pitch. If we don't have sales involved in building the pitch, the pitch is never going to stick. The rule with sales reps is even if they don't like their current pitch, they're comfortable with the current pitch and they know it and they've memorized it and they have a little joke they tell on slide three. So they're not going to give up the current pitch without a fight. So you got to get sales management involved in building a new pitch, and then I would never just build the new pitch and then heave it over the wall and say, "Good luck, Chuck." Because what'll happen is they'll come up with all kinds of excuses why they can't use this pitch.

(01:02:07):
Instead, what you do is you take your best sales rep, your best one, and you bring your best sales rep over and you train them on the new pitch. They got to learn it, they got to pitch it to you, pitch it to the head of sales. We do a bunch of repetition on that, and then we have that rep test the pitch with qualified prospects. So we don't go to existing customers. They've already been polluted with the old positioning and the old pitch, and this needs to work with a qualified prospect, so let's do it in the way it was intended. We're going to take qualified prospects and work that new pitch with them. Usually what we'll do is a test period where after every pitch we'll huddle and say, "What worked? What didn't work? Maybe that word is tripping people up. Maybe we need to move this slide from here to here," and so we'll tune it.

(01:02:53):
And then after we've done a bunch of pitches, one of two things happens. And so in this test structure, I am very much relying on the expertise of my best rep to know what's good. So after the best rep is comfortable with the pitch, done a bunch of pitches, re-twizzled it, at some point the rep will say, "Okay, I think we're done optimizing this pitch, and I'm not going back to the old pitch. I'm sticking with this pitch because I think this one works better." An experienced sales rep will know that, whether the pitch is better than the old pitch, if you give them the opportunity to feel comfortable with it, work with it a bit and pitch a bunch of new prospects with it.

(01:03:38):
So if your best sales rep says, "Oh, this is way better than the old pitch. I can just feel it from the way people react to it and the number of times we've been able to convert people over into actual opportunities from a first call." Then what you do is at that point I call that pass. So then we take that rep, we can film them doing the pitch for training, and then we can take that rep, go back to the rest of the sales team and have that rep sell everybody else on it. So that rep goes back and says, "Listen up people, you're stupid if you're using that old pitch, which sucks. This new pitch is way better. Trust me, I'm the best rep on this whole team. By the way here's the list of deals I have cooking in the pipeline that I got using this deck. You should go do it and I'm going to teach you how to do it."

(01:04:24):
Now I got sales, teaching sales, teach and sales instead of marketing, sort of throwing something over the wall and crossing their fingers and saying, "Hey, I hope this works." What we should see is an immediate uplift in what happens after first call. So most of the time what that is we get a higher percentage of deals converting into opportunities after that first substantive calls. Sometimes depending on the quality of the pipeline we had coming in, we're actually disqualifying more. But sometimes that's a good thing.

(01:04:54):
But what we should see is an immediate uptick. It's stuff coming into the pipeline. It's a neat trick to pull, especially right now when everybody's budgets are really tight and you're just trying to squeeze more juice out of the lemon. It's a really easy way to get some more juice out of the pipeline. Just go in, tighten up your positioning, tighten up that sales pitch. And we can have instant impact with that because we can roll that out in a couple of weeks and start getting better deals flowing through the pipeline because these customers are understanding your value better, understanding why to pick you better. It's just easy, low hanging fruit to do when the economy's bad.

Lenny (01:05:32):
To give people a sense of maybe how easy that might be, how long would you suggest people spend on maybe tweaking their positioning and then also on this pilot, how much total time could it take to potentially significantly increase sales?

April Dunford (01:05:45):
So in the customers that I work with, when we do the positioning stuff, the positioning stuff takes a week. We're beginning and we're done in a week. We're all about speed on this thing. We're trying to get the thing happening fast. So we're in and out on the positioning in a week. It might take you, it depends on the company, the bigger the company, the slower this is, but some big companies are actually quite fast, and if you're motivated, it shouldn't take long for us to take that pitch and make it real.

(01:06:11):
Then we got to find a rep, train the rep, and then how long it takes us to test it really depends on how much deal flow you've got. So if you're working on monster deals and you don't actually get that many qualified prospects to pitch, that might take a few weeks. But if you've got a lot of prospects coming through the door, and you can get through this fairly quickly. So I've had companies do it start to finish. We got new pitch out the door and people using it in two weeks. That's about as fast as you can get it done. Most folks, I would say take about a month.

Lenny (01:06:39):
Cool. That is a very short-

April Dunford (01:06:40):
Sometimes you're like IBM and who knows when you get to it, right? But most folks could get through it if everybody's motivated, we can get it out and have it running a month.

Lenny (01:06:50):
You mentioned marketing and earlier you said that marketing is involved in this process in some way. What's your advice to just how to involve marketing, where they fit in?

April Dunford (01:06:58):
Yeah, so usually marketing is going to end up being the stewards of the positioning once the positioning is done. So they're going to end up being positioning police after this because a lot of the positioning stuff is going to take the form of marketing things. So they're invested in this. So when I was the VP marketing, I was the person that would instigate the positioning thing, let's get everybody together and work on the positioning. And then I would usually be the person that is driving, getting the sales pitch figured out, but it's me and sales and product working together. And then once the sales pitch is done, depending on the size of the organization and whether or not you have sales enablement or somebody inside sales that can babysit the pitch. Usually me and the head of sales would work on, "Okay, this is the pitch and this is locked down and we're not actually going to change this pitch until something happens that requires us to change the positioning. And then that's when we'll re-look at the pitch."

(01:07:55):
So we would look at recertifying the reps every quarter on the pitch and all that kind of stuff. And that would be generally, me in partnership with the head of sales. But it depends on how you do it. I don't think it really matters who owns it. If you have a good product marketing organization, good product marketing organization generally is very concerned with the positioning and the pitch, and those two things sit in their purview, but depends on how you define it. I can't wait till you get Airbnb. Tell us how this stuff works. They're different because they're a consumer, but companies are arranged in all different ways. So if you have product marketing, it looks one way. If you don't, it looks another way. Somebody's got to kind of be the owner of this thing though. And so we have to decide who that's going to be.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Just a couple more questions. One is to motivate people to do this. What kind of impact have you seen at companies that invest this time and rethink the way they pitch?

April Dunford (01:08:49):
Well, so people don't like me to talk about revenue stuff. Hugely what we've seen though is again, the immediate impact is felted sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that.

April Dunford (01:09:00):
Impact is felt in sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that. Because sometimes what the worry is, is we've got this old positioning and they came in through the pipeline that way. So they were exposed to our marketing somewhere with this old positioning, and then we hit them with the new positioning with this sales pitch. And aren't they going to be all like, "Oh, you moved my cheese." And usually it ends up not being a problem at all. So usually what we see immediately is an uptick in what's happening in sales. And so I've had a couple of companies tell me they've doubled the number of deals that they're bringing from first sales call to opportunity just by tightening up the pitch and getting that going. I think that's not unusual. I worked at a company where we did it in-house where I was the VP marketing, and we, within two quarters, had doubled the revenue just by tightening up the pitch. Just tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:53):
Holy shit. All right.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:54):
No big deal.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Yep.

Lenny (01:09:54):
Okay. So-

April Dunford (01:09:56):
It was a big shift in positioning, I'll tell you that. Not small. Most of the time, we're not doing that. Most of the time, it's a tightening. We're not saying, "Oh, we used to be this and now we're this." Most of the time, it's a tightening, but usually the pitches are so bad. I'm telling you they're so bad that there's this low hanging fruit there that if we could improve it even a little bit, it actually has this big impact on how much stuff survives down the pipe.

Lenny (01:10:25):
And again, if folks want to go deep into the positioning step, your first book Obviously Awesome, is a great guide, and our first podcast episode goes through this. Plus you have a guest post in my newsletter where you give them a quick start guide. So there's so many tools to help you through this process.

April Dunford (01:10:38):
So many tools.

Lenny (01:10:39):
The other thought I've had in the back of my mind as we've been chatting is a previous guest, Andy Raskin, has a different framework, feels similar, but I know they're different. His framework starts with a shift that's happened in the world, and then here's who's going to win in the shift, here's who's going to lose. And then he goes into why this product is the best. What's your perspective on that approach versus this approach and the big differences?

April Dunford (01:11:01):
So the thing with that framework is I do think it works in certain conditions, but again, I think the conditions might be kind of edgy. So there's a couple of things that I think are lacking in that structure for a sales pitch. So the first one is there's actually no concept of differentiated value in that pitch, which for me is a giant miss. So in that pitch, it assumes that new is inherently valuable and old is inherently bad, and sometimes that's true. So sometimes there's just you versus the status quo and the status quo is some terrible old thing, some legacy thing or it's manual processes or something, and you're the only thing out there, then you can get away with that. But most of the time, we don't have that. Most of the time, there's multiple new ways of doing something and you just can't say, "Well, I'm the only new and the rest of you are old and bad."

(01:11:55):
So usually I've got to thread the needle. And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that for most companies, if we really understood customer and decision, old is good, it's safe, it's not risky. And does anybody ever say, "No, I'm not going to buy Salesforce. That's the old stuff,"? I just don't think that happens. So in a lot of cases, I don't think you can rely, it's lazy to say, "Buy this because it's new and new is better." Most of the time, the customers are going to want to know, well, what's better about it? Tell me what the value is that I can't get anywhere else. And you're going to have to get more specific than just saying, "Trust me, it's new and new is good." So that's the first thing. The second thing is this idea of starting with a trend. On the surface it looks kind of good, but the problem is often the trend is not unique to you. So everybody else sees the trend too. And so you are starting in a way that any of your competitors could start the same way.

(01:12:59):
I did this for years where I was taught to do problem solution. We would define the problem like a trend. We'd say, "Well, the change in the world." I was selling databases and I'd say, "Change in the world, data is exponentially growing." It's like, no shit. We all know that. All of my competitors could say that, and all of my competitors deal with the trend in the same way. So unless you have a particularly unique take on the trend, well, then it's not the trend at all really, is it? It's your insight into the trend. So I don't think trend is that great because it's not always unique to you. And ideally what we want is something that we can say that none of our competitors can. And typically a trend is something outside of our control. It's out in the world and everybody else can see it too.

(01:13:47):
So I don't think it's great. I think that structure looks a lot like the structure we use in a VC pitch or an investor pitch because we're talking about much longer timelines and we can say, "Look, the world is really changing and 10 years from now there's going to be chaos and destruction and the only one standing is us and therefore there is no competition." And because the timeframes are longer and we're talking about disruption of an entire market, which is pretty theoretical, we can get away with a lot of that stuff in investor pitch. In fact, we want to go there in investor pitch. Sales pitch is all about right now. Sales pitch is like, okay, I'm going to exchange my money for right now. You can't get too far into the future. Otherwise, all I'm doing is giving everybody a reason to delay, which they're likely to do anyway because they're indecisive about what they should do.

Lenny (01:14:39):
I feel like I need a debate version of this podcast where people come on and-

April Dunford (01:14:43):
I know, but here's the thing that I think people should think about when they're looking at all this stuff because it's terribly confusing if you're trying to figure this out. The one thing I really dislike about the category creation folks is they say that's the only way that you can be successful. And in general, that's just not true about anything. There's lots of ways to do everything. And so I think people should mess around with stuff. And for any of these frameworks, I think they should look at it and see if it works for them and their situation. And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

(01:15:16):
And I think they should steal things from wherever they can steal it and figure out what works in their own situation. My stuff, I like to think is a starting point, folks should use it as a starting point, but people shouldn't be slaves to it. There are lots of things that work at a market, and I think the only thing that we know for certain is that we can't say, "Well, this is the rule and it always works like this." If it was that easy, again, this wouldn't be so hard. We wouldn't have podcasts and newsletters and all kinds of things trying to figure this stuff out.

Lenny (01:15:49):
Extremely true. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

April Dunford (01:15:54):
Oh yeah. Lightning round. Oh gosh. It gives me stress. Okay.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Okay, question number one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

April Dunford (01:16:04):
Well, that's an easy question. So right now I'm really into Matt Dixon's work right now, which we've mentioned him a couple of times on the podcast, but Matt Dixon's new book called The JOLT Effect is really great just because there's all this data and the things that he discovered with that data, a lot of it go against what we would consider accepted sales wisdom. And so I think that book is full of juicy nuggets and everybody should look at it. His previous book, The Challenger Sale, and there was a companion book to that called The Challenger Customer. Those were also excellent and based on a deep set of research. And those books are older now, but what we see in The JOLT Effect is all the stuff holds true. All the stuff from The Challenger Sale has not changed in 10 years. So I think those books together are really cool.

(01:16:54):
The other one that I always recommend is the original book on positioning, which is the book by Ries and Trout Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. I have my copy of it, is dogeared. I probably read that book 100 times and I still see stuff in that book that I didn't see before. So I think if you really want to go deep on this positioning stuff, my book is the how to book. Their book is what is it in the first place book. And I think everybody that's interested in positioning should go read that.

Lenny (01:17:19):
Amazing. By the way, I have your first book somewhere behind me there. I don't know where it is, but it's there.

April Dunford (01:17:23):
I got mine right here so I can do this gag. There it is.

Lenny (01:17:23):
Nailed it.

April Dunford (01:17:27):
There's the new one, there's the old one.

Lenny (01:17:27):
The YouTube audience can see that trick that you've learned. Second question, what is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

April Dunford (01:17:36):
Oh man, I'm going to get in trouble for this. So you know Bong Joon-ho is the guy that did the movie Parasite?

Lenny (01:17:47):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:47):
So [inaudible 01:17:48] before Parasite, there was this book called, this movie called Snow Piercer. It's really old. I think it came out in-

Lenny (01:17:54):
I've seen that. Is that with the train?

April Dunford (01:17:54):
2013. Have you seen it?

Lenny (01:17:54):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:57):
So I love this movie so much. So recently I went on a train trip with my dad and before I went to the train trip, we got talking about trains. And then we all had to go watch Snow Piercer again. Like me and my daughter watching Snow Piercer. We're really into this movie. And it's funny, when it came out, I was working at a startup and the CEO came and said, "Seen any good movies lately?" And I was like, "Oh man, you got to see this movie Snow Piercer." And he went on a first date with a woman and he came back the next day and he was so mad. He was not just kind of mad. He was really mad at me. He was like, "That was the worst movie I've ever seen." I was like, "Dude, you should have told me you were going on a date. I didn't know."

Lenny (01:18:40):
Yeah, that is my experience with that movie. I did not enjoy it, but I think you have to go into it [inaudible 01:18:46]

April Dunford (01:18:46):
It's polarizing. You either think it's amazing or you're like, that was terrible. What did I just watch?

Lenny (01:18:52):
This explains your taste in movies. We learned a lot about you, April. That movie is something else.

April Dunford (01:19:00):
Did you see Parasite? That was amazing.

Lenny (01:19:02):
That was amazing. Very different. Not what I imagined. I didn't realize it was the same person.

April Dunford (01:19:06):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (01:19:08):
All right. Okay, cool. That's two movies for people to watch. I'm curious how people think of Snow Piercer.

April Dunford (01:19:13):
Be warned don't go on a date with this.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Oh man, I still think about that movie sometimes. Next question, what is a favorite interview question you like to ask people that you're interviewing? Usually this is for when you're hiring, so whatever this comes up for you.

April Dunford (01:19:28):
So back when I was running teams internally back in my VP marketing days, I felt like a lot of marketing folks came with a certain amount of bad habits, particularly startup marketing folks. It's a bit of the wild west in marketing. And so sometimes they'd come in and you get into somebody new and they'd be really smart, but they learned something at the previous company that you're like, please never do that here. It's not going to work here. And so I developed a thing where I was just looking for attitude. Were you enthusiastic? Are you super into what we're doing here? And I can teach you pretty much anything. The only thing I can't teach you is persuasive writing. And I think that's a learnable skill. I think people can learn how to do persuasive writing.

(01:20:12):
I just don't have time to teach it to you myself. And so I used to give people a writing test, so I'd say, "Look, think of something you bought recently and write me two paragraphs and just sell me on it." And I used to love that test because people could either do it or they can't. And there's just so much stuff we end up doing in product marketing and marketing that involves a little bit of writing that it's kind of a foundational skill. And if you don't have that, that was the one thing I couldn't teach you.

Lenny (01:20:42):
Wow, that is fascinating. I've never heard of that as an interview question. And I love it. I feel like product managers-

April Dunford (01:20:47):
I stole it from a company that made me do it before I got hired, and I was like, this is a really smart thing. I'm [inaudible 01:20:53] stealing it. My thing was I got anxiety and I couldn't decide what product to write about, and I had literally just bought a new pair of running shoes. So I wrote two paragraphs about my new Brooks distance running shoes. But it was good. I got the job.

Lenny (01:21:09):
It is an excellent segue to our next question, which is, is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

April Dunford (01:21:15):
Right now I'm kind of into, I don't even know how to describe this category of things, but things that are kind of low tech but are awesome. And so one of the category of things that I really love right now is I'm really into fountain pens. I don't know if you've ever written with a fountain pen. [inaudible 01:21:35]

Lenny (01:21:35):
I haven't, but I know what they are.

April Dunford (01:21:36):
And so there's this company, Lamy, they're based in Germany, and they make the world's greatest fountain pens. They're beautiful, they're amazing. Some of them are really expensive. If you want to spend a lot of money on a pen, you can. But they have this one called the AL-Star, which is not an expensive pen. It's 20, $30. It may be expensive for a pen, but it's not so much money that you wouldn't feel bad if you lost it. So Lamy AL-Star. That's my great product lately. I don't have one right here. I should, it'd be a great prop to pick it up, but I actually don't have my bag here and it's in my bag. But Lamy AL-Star. You Google it. These are beautiful pens. And then if you haven't written with a fountain pen, it takes a minute to get used to it, but then it's like, gosh, it just feels great. You'll never write with a ballpoint pen again.

Lenny (01:22:22):
I was going to ask, is it the feel of the writing that you really enjoy about it?

April Dunford (01:22:25):
Feel. Totally different. Yeah. Amazing.

Lenny (01:22:29):
I use Muji pens. I don't know if you know these pens.

April Dunford (01:22:31):
Oh yeah, these are actually really good. They're like roller ball pens, roller ball pen, very good, but not as good as the fountain pen.

Lenny (01:22:31):
It's no fountain pen.

April Dunford (01:22:38):
The Muji pen is pretty good.

Lenny (01:22:39):
Then do you have to dip it in ink and stuff? How does that work?

April Dunford (01:22:41):
No. You actually, they either come with a little cartridge that you stick in or if you feel bad about the environment, you don't want to be throwing out cartridges all the time, there's a refillable cartridge, so you basically just stick another thing and it sucks it up and yeah, you don't dip it in ink. That would be crazy. I can't take that on the airplane, man.

Lenny (01:22:58):
Confiscate your ink. All right, questions get a little more challenging potentially or really easy. Do you have a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, you like to share with people, that you find useful to come back to?

April Dunford (01:23:11):
My thing lately is, and maybe this is just an old person thing, but my thing lately is nothing's a big deal. Nothing's a big deal, nothing's a big deal. And so you'll have stuff that you think is a really big deal, positive or negative, and you'll be like, wow, if this thing happened, it'd be so great, and then it happens and you're like, yeah, it's pretty great, but things are good otherwise, or it'll be the opposite. Like, oh, if this thing happened, it'd be so bad. Then it happens and you're like, that wasn't that bad. And so I don't know if this is good or bad, but lately I'm in this zone of I'm in this kind of chill zone where I'm like, nothing's a big deal, man. Everything's cool.

Lenny (01:23:56):
That super resonates. And as much as you say that to yourself, it's still hard to convince yourself of that sometimes. But that is a really good motto. I'm going to steal that myself. I kind of say that to myself often in different way.

April Dunford (01:24:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:24:10):
What is the most valuable lesson your mom or your dad taught you?

April Dunford (01:24:15):
Yeah, it is funny because it's a little bit related to that. So my dad ran a business, so I grew up in a really small town and my dad and it's cottage country in Canada. And so my dad ran the local toys for tourists, like boats and motorcycles and ATVs and that sort of thing. And he ran that business for years and years and he sold it a few years back when he retired. But it's a neat thing to grow up in entrepreneurial family because you kind of see this highs and lows. The business is really good. Then the business was really bad and then we were all broke and then the business was good and we were not broke. So there was this thing, and my dad used to always kind of have this attitude of you just got to grind it out.

(01:25:01):
You're just going to grind it out. There's going to be good stuff, there's going to be bad stuff, but the key is to just keep going, just keep going. And so he ran that business for whatever, 30, 40 years. I don't know. His motto is the home of fun since '71. So he started it in '71. I think he sold it three, four years ago. So a long time.

Lenny (01:25:21):
Wow.

April Dunford (01:25:22):
It all worked out good in the end. And so I don't know, I think there's something cool about growing up in a family where you can see the highs and lows and then again be like everything's we're just grinding it out over here. Nothing's a big deal.

Lenny (01:25:34):
It's clear where all that comes from now.

April Dunford (01:25:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:25:37):
Final question. You do a lot of traveling, you do a lot of speaking, you go to a bunch of cities. I'm curious just what is your favorite either city that you go to that maybe people may not know about or venue that you speak at?

April Dunford (01:25:49):
It's such a cliche, but I love Paris. I just love it. But for me, Paris is like a particular vibe. So when I was in university, I did an exchange when I was in engineering and I did third year engineering at a school just outside of Paris. And so I spent the whole year there, learned a bit of French. My French was pretty good at the end. My French is really bad now. So I kind of get Paris. I like Paris. And so when I go to Paris, I just have the best time. I have my set of restaurants I want to go to. I have my handful of places I want to go shopping. I put my butt down in a cafe, look at the beautiful people, drink my nice coffee. I just really dig the whole vibe of Paris and people are starting to know that now. So French companies will call me and they'll say, "Do we get a Paris discount? We hear you like coming here." And I go, "Okay."

Lenny (01:26:50):
Now this is going to [inaudible 01:26:51]

April Dunford (01:26:51):
There's a great product management conference there called La Product Conference run by these folks at Tega, shout out to Tega. So I've been there a number of times for their conferences and they do an amazing job and the venue is really great. It changes around. But last year, the last time I went there, which was two years ago, it was at an old theater in [inaudible 01:27:13]. Absolutely beautiful. And that was a pretty great venue in a great city with a great conference. So yeah, shout out to French people.

Lenny (01:27:22):
Oh man. That sounds dreamy. Paris. I see how that could be a favorite. April, I think we accomplished everything we were hoping to accomplish. I think everyone that has listened to this podcast is going to be better at pitching and selling. It feels like even if they take one element of this framework, say starting with an insight or focusing on different value will make them better. And so I'm proud of us. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

April Dunford (01:27:50):
So where can people find me? I'm aprildunford.com. The only social media I'm doing these days is LinkedIn. I'm a bit social media-ed out. I'm experimenting a little on threads and Instagram, but LinkedIn is a good place to find me if you just want low lift way to follow my stuff. But I'm doing all the things now, Lenny, I got a podcast, it's called Positioning with April Dunford. I got a newsletter that's also called Positioning. You can find that if you go to, it's on Substacks, you can find it there, otherwise aprildunford.com/books and you can sign up there. But those are the big things. And then there's the books, obviously, if you want to learn more about this stuff. Everything I know is in the book. There isn't stuff that I know that isn't in the book to be honest.

Lenny (01:28:34):
Amazing. And then how can listeners be useful to you? Just check out those things.

April Dunford (01:28:37):
I guess so. You know what? I'm in this phase. I think, again, I think it's an old age thing. I am in this kind of philosophical phase where I'm not going to be doing this forever. And what I'm trying to do right now is get everything that's useful out of my head and out in the world before I'm done. And so right now I'm very focused on delivering useful things for other people. I didn't think I needed to write a book about sales pitches, but then I got the idea in my head, everybody's sales pitch is so bad and there isn't a book on how to build a sales pitch. And I'm not saying mine's the world's greatest thing, but it's better than nothing. So this is what I'm trying to do right now. I'm trying to be useful to other people because pretty soon I'm not going to be doing anything, I think is the idea.

Lenny (01:29:29):
Arnold Schwarzenegger's new book is called Be Useful. And I feel like that's the perfect description of how to be successful and especially in the work that we do, just helping people. But I keep coming back to that. It's just be useful.

April Dunford (01:29:41):
I think this is a really important thing. When I wrote the first book, people started writing back to me and saying, "Oh, your book was so great." And my reflex action was to say, "Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it." But then I stumped myself and I was like, you know what? I don't actually care if you enjoyed it. This isn't entertainment. I'm actually trying to create something that's useful. So what I really want is for people to read this stuff and come back and say, "That was useful. We were struggling with this thing, and that unlocked something for me and that was useful." And that's what I'm trying to do right now.

Lenny (01:30:11):
April, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing.

April Dunford (01:30:14):
Thanks so much. It's always good to be here.

Lenny (01:30:17):
Always good to have you here. And we might do a V3 when you do a third book if you ever-

April Dunford (01:30:21):
No, not happening.

Lenny (01:30:25):

## Transcript

Arielle Jackson (00:00:00):
So over time, a word can come to mean something that is beyond what that actual word means. Like Disney means magic today. Volvo means safety. Those names are not good. If I just put it in a spreadsheet or one of those lists, no one would pick it. So that's kind of what I mean, that the name is just part of the overall marketing or the overall brand and a bad name with a really great company with great company strategy, great marketing is going to be great over time. And a good name is just going to help you, but I don't think a bad name is going to kill a good company.

Lenny (00:00:42):
Arielle Jackson spent nine years at Google, where she helped grow Gmail in its early days, taking it from just a side project to a product that is now used by hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Then she went on to Square, where she was one of the first marketers and helped launch and scale the growth of Square reader. She's also worked with over 100 early stage companies, helping them nail their brand and marketing efforts, including Patreon, Loom, Front, Eero, Maven, Sprig, just to name a few.

Lenny (00:01:12):
These days, she teaches a super popular course on startup brand strategy and she's a marketer in residence at First Round capital. In our chat, we cover primarily three things, naming strategies for your startup or your product, a framework for developing your brand, that includes your purpose, your positioning, and your personality, and also getting PR for your startup. I can't wait for you to listen to this conversation with Arielle. And so with that, I bring you Arielle Jackson.

Lenny (00:01:41):
Hey, Ashley, head of marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:01:49):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:01:51):
And how many of them screw that up? And what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:01:54):
Well? Based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:02:13):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I'm consistently seeing that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:02:28):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because [inaudible 00:02:38] data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

This episode is brought to you by unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList head of product, banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack.

Lenny (00:03:15):

Lenny (00:03:58):
Welcome to the podcast, Arielle.

Arielle Jackson (00:04:01):
Thanks so much for having me. It's great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:03):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've read so much of your writing online. You've done a lot of writing, which I found really helpful. And so I'm really jazzed to be digging into all kinds of really good stuff. Before we get into some of the meat, just a couple questions that I had in my mind. You've worked with so many amazing companies, Google, Square, Loom, Patreon, Front. So many others. I don't want to keep going. What's been either your favorite or most unusual project that you've worked on?

Arielle Jackson (00:04:35):
Gosh, it's like asking me to choose my favorite son. I'm like, gosh, I can't really like pick one.

Lenny (00:04:40):
That'll be the next question.

Arielle Jackson (00:04:41):
I would probably say that my favorite project, and this is because they get reminded of it on a daily basis was working at on the Square stand at Square. It was the first time I ever worked on hardware and our joint Square was 140 people. We had no marketing function. We had a couple marketing people. We had no product managers and the hardware team was running the show on launching this new product that was supposed to get us up market into brick and mortar.

Arielle Jackson (00:05:05):
And anyway, I was running event marketing at the time and giving away a bunch of those readers that you stick into a phone for free and having a lot of small merchants use. I volunteered to run the launch of this product as a product marketer for the first time. And it was just so fun, doing everything from positioning it, figuring out how we were going to talk about this beautiful new piece of hardware that would turn your iPad into a real point of sale.

Arielle Jackson (00:05:31):
We had people fly around the country and get cool coffee shops and brick and mortar businesses seeding it so that they would all use it. We had I think 15 Metro areas covered with the coolest coffee shops and donut shops and everything at launch. And you know, there was a lot of fake it till you make it. I was negotiating a deal with Best Buy in the Apple store. Never done anything like that before.

Arielle Jackson (00:05:53):
Designing packaging was really awesome. There was just so much to it launching a physical product. And at the time it was at a pretty high price point for a company that had always had one free product and helping that company go up market. And I remember I was 30 something weeks pregnant when we launched. We got all the blue bottle stores to use it. And we had this launch event where Jack, our head of hardware, Jesse unveiled this product at the blue bottle in Mint Plaza. And I was super pregnant and super proud. And I still get kind of excited every time I pay on one of those, which is all the time.

Lenny (00:06:30):
Super pregnant and super proud. I love it. And that product that was the POS stand, the iPad thing that you kind of swivel and sign.

Arielle Jackson (00:06:39):
Yeah. And there's been new versions of it since, there's a contactless version of it, and there's one with an integrated screen that I think is Android based, which you don't have to have an iPad, but that product's still around. I still pay on that original Square stand all the time. I drink a lot of coffee. Those independent coffee shops around LA. So they're all still using it.

Lenny (00:07:01):
We're going to talk about positioning a bunch, but while we're on the topic, what was the positioning of that product while we're talking about it?

Arielle Jackson (00:07:07):
Yeah, so at the time Square was mostly used by farmer's market vendors and event vendors. I made jewelry in a past life and that's how I got to Square was being one of those vendors. And the positioning was really that it was for brick and mortar businesses, particularly quick serve coffee, donuts, sandwich shops that kind of quick serve brick and mortars. And it was up against your ugly old point of sale. Your cash register effectively. That was our foil. And the benefit was turn your iPad into a point of sale. And the differentiator was about one unified experience that you can do everything you can on your cash register and more, and you'd be proud to have it out on your counter.

Lenny (00:08:01):
So you said that you were creating jewelry and that's how you got into Square to work on this product. I need to hear more about that.

Arielle Jackson (00:08:08):
Yeah, sure. So I was working at Google before Square and I'd always had this hobby of making jewelry and I used to sell my jewelry in a few different like boutiques around San Francisco and LA. It was a very small side hustle, but it was my creative outlet. And I sold at craft fairs around Hanukah/Christmas time. So I used to sell and just take cash. And then I got a Square reader and I sold at a craft fair that year. And it was awesome. That Square reader, it helped people buy more, it helped me sort of look cool. It was just really great to accept credit cards. I'd never done it before.

Arielle Jackson (00:08:49):
I used to take PayPal invoices and be on my computer and send someone an invoice and they'd get it. It was painful. All the reasons that people use Square, I experienced it. And two people I knew from Google, Megan Quinn and Kyle Dink had gone to Square from Google. And so after I had that experience, I think I sent them both an email just being like, this thing's fucking awesome. I make jewelry. It was great. I sold I think it was 50% more than I did last year because I accepted credit cards and I can't remember which of them wrote back first, but they were like, come interview. And so that was basically how I ended up at Square.

Lenny (00:09:27):
Wow. I bet that helped you a lot through the interview, actual have personal experience.

Arielle Jackson (00:09:32):
Having been a merchant, I think it helped me understand the small merchant that initially we were marketing to.

Lenny (00:09:38):
And so today you are marketing expert in residence at [inaudible 00:09:45] capital. I was going to ask what does that mean and what is it that you do day to day these days?

Arielle Jackson (00:09:51):
Sure. So after I left Square, I went to a tiny startup that was seven people. They were funded by First Round and I helped them with everything that a tiny startup that's trying to grow needs.

Lenny (00:10:06):
What startup was that?

Arielle Jackson (00:10:06):
It was called Cover. They were acquired by Twitter. It was an Android app that could get you the right apps at the right time based on where you were by changing the lock screen on your phone. And so that company and that experience of working at this tiny startup that was seven people, I really liked it. And then they got acquired by Twitter, but I had just left Square. So I decided not to join Twitter with the rest of the team. And instead I just decided I was going to help a bunch of other small startups. And I emailed a few friends from past lives who had small startups, which was like, Hey, I'm not going to Twitter with the rest of the team. You do need marketing help. And every single person wrote back and said, yes. And that's basically how I started consulting.

Arielle Jackson (00:10:49):
I guess it was about eight or nine years ago. At the same time, First Round had reached out and said, hey, who did you use for marketing comps for cover? And I got connected with Brett from First Round and he's like, would you help our companies? And we did a three month project for one day a week, nine years ago. And I'm still there. I work halftime at First Round. So I do everything I do for other companies, but for First Round companies on First Rounds time.

Arielle Jackson (00:11:17):
So the way it works is if you're funded by First Round and as part of your onboarding, we offer a lot of value add services and I'm one of them. And those services can be everything from, we have someone who's really good at compensation and HR stuff and we have someone who will help you with pricing and I'll help you with marketing. And what that means when you're a seed stage startup is everything from naming to positioning, to developing a brand identity, a website and your initial launch, and eventually hiring a marketer. So that's sort of the bread and butter. That's what I like working on anyway. So it's a good fit because we invest in a lot of seed stage companies at First Round, I get to help almost all of them.

Lenny (00:11:58):
That's an excellent segue to what I wanted to get to next. What I want to do in our chat is cover three broad topics. Things that I know are very near and dear to your heart, naming for products and startups, your brand development framework and how to hire marketers. Does that sound good?

Arielle Jackson (00:12:15):
Awesome. That's what I like to talk about. So yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (00:12:19):
Let's do it. Surprise, surprise. Okay. So with naming, I've actually heard from a few founders that you were really helpful to them in naming their startups. Folks that have maybe been on this podcast that will go unnamed. So for founders trying to come up with a name for their company or their product, two questions. What makes a good name for a product or a startup, and then just how do you come up with a great name?

Arielle Jackson (00:12:44):
I love naming. I think I've named just over 30 companies at this point. And actually when I mention how I got into consulting when I emailed some friends and asked them if they needed marketing help, I think I'm allowed to talk about this one. So one of those companies was some friends from Google, Adrian and Carl. They had left Google, gone to Facebook and then started a company it's now called Seesaw. It's an ed tech company. That was the first company I named post Google Square, all of that.

Lenny (00:13:09):
It's an awesome name.

Arielle Jackson (00:13:10):
It is an awesome name and I'll use it as an example. So seesaw is a ed tech company. They had a really bad name before that and we did this whole naming process and ended with that name and why I think that's a good name is when I say Seesaw, you don't really know what it is, but when I tell you, oh, it's this ed tech company and it's an iPad app and it helps the work that elementary school students do go between the teacher, the parents and the student. And you're like, oh, well, Seesaw makes sense for elementary school, it's something that goes back and forth. It has that sort of nostalgic feel. And it makes sense that it's an ed tech company.

Arielle Jackson (00:13:48):
And I personally tend to like those kinds of names that are suggestive or evocative, where when I tell you what the company does, you're like, oh, that makes sense. But it's not that what the name is tells you exactly what the company does. So that's an example, I think of a good name. I don't know, during COVID and when my older son's school was closed and they all used Seesaw and I got to tell my son, oh, that's my friend's company and we named it back in the day. And he was like, oh, that's cool. That name makes sense.

Arielle Jackson (00:14:21):
That's the reaction you want. It also has a little bit of emotion to it. It has some nostalgia. It's fun to say it's short, it's memorable. I think all of those things make a good name. Another company that has a good name that you and I have both worked with is Maven. So they're a First Round company. Gogan has talked about this publicly. We named that company together. Maven is a Yiddish word that means one who understands and it means specifically one who understands because they've done something, they've acquired the skills or knowledge over time.

Arielle Jackson (00:14:58):
And I just think that's such a cool name for a platform that allows X operators or current operators to teach their skills to other people through cohort based classes. You want to be a Maven, instructors are Maven's, it's short, it's easy to say, when I tell you what that company does, that name makes perfect sense. So I tend to like those [inaudible 00:15:17] of names myself, but I also, I don't know, I like other kinds of names for other kinds of products too. I think it really comes down to what is your product? What is your company? What is the name trying to achieve and really getting clearer with those criteria. So we can talk about the criteria that always apply, the criteria you might add and a process to get there.

Lenny (00:15:38):
That sounds great. Yeah. I'm really curious about a process. If one exists, that'd be really cool. So another question in my mind is just some names are just nonsense words like Yahoo and I don't know Google, I guess. What's your take on that as a name, that approach?

Arielle Jackson (00:15:51):
Yeah. So words like that are empty vessels, they really don't mean anything. If you think about the name Yahoo, it's actually like really silly. It's like Yahoo. I always hear it like that. Google has a meaning for people in the know with the one followed by as many zeros. It's like a big number and it's a misspelling of that. So that one's a little less silly to me than Yahoo. My take on empty vessel names is they can be really memorable and they can be evocative of the emotion, but you have to do a lot more marketing work over time to make it mean something.

Arielle Jackson (00:16:25):
So if I say Yahoo today, we know it's that search engine we use before we all switch to Google and we have the purple color in our head, and we think about what it meant at the time that we might have used it, but it took a lot of marketing dollars and a lot of time for that word to be in that. So they're doable. I worked on a company Eero. That has kind of what is almost an empty vessel name. Eero is for Eero Saarinen who was a designer. He did like these really beautiful buildings, architectural buildings. And then also some tables. You can get a Saarinen and table at Design Within Reach, but that name, nobody knows that unless you're in the design community. And so that name is effectively an empty vessel and they have to spend a lot and be consistent about making that [inaudible 00:17:16] mean a wifi system.

Lenny (00:17:17):
I want to get to the process, but another question is why is it important for the name to kind of connect to the company and what they do? Is that just it feels nice to people or is there some kind of a bigger reason?

Arielle Jackson (00:17:30):
Yeah. So it doesn't have to, and examples like Eero and Yahoo, it doesn't. Even if you think about Apple, it doesn't. Apple has nothing to do with Apple computers. It's a word we all know. There's a lot of words where there's no meaning behind it. If there is a meaning behind your name, your name is doing a little bit more of your marketing work for you. So if your name is Internet Explorer, RIP, I know exactly what you do.

Arielle Jackson (00:17:56):
If your name is Chrome and you're a designer on the web, you kind of might be like, oh, that makes sense. That's the area around the browsing window. If your name is Firefox, I have no idea what you did. You just took two words and put them together and made something up. And now you have to spend, and you have to be consistent over time in making that word mean something for people. But all three of those browsers were successful at a time. And I don't think the name had anything to do with Internet Explorer's demise.

Lenny (00:18:25):
Got it. So it's kind of ideally you can find an easy mode. If that doesn't work, then you go hard mode. You come up with your empty vessel name and then you just have to do a lot of work.

Arielle Jackson (00:18:33):
That's my personal preference.

Lenny (00:18:35):
Okay, cool. That makes sense.

Arielle Jackson (00:18:37):
My personal preference is if you think about there's descriptive names, the Internet Explorer, there's suggestive names like Chrome, then there's evocative names, which I would say Seesaw and Maven fit into there where they're like in between suggestive and evocative, and then there's empty vessel names or fanciful names. There's a spectrum. And when you do your brainstorm, we can talk about this in the process, you want to think across all of them, but you might have in your naming brief, we want a suggestive name, or we want a descriptive name. You might go into it with that. And so there's times and places for all of those names across the spectrum. My personal bias is I tend to like suggestive names.

Lenny (00:19:16):
Makes sense. Okay, let's get into it. What should teams do when they're trying to name something?

Arielle Jackson (00:19:22):
Yeah. So the first thing is to do your product positioning. I really believe that positioning dictates so much of your marketing and should always be the first thing you do. I had a student in my last class that I taught through Maven. I teach a class on brand strategy and he was I think a second or third time founder, who had never taken a class on brand strategy. He worked really hard. He was awesome. Anyway, at the end of the class and you kind of do this closing thing. And he goes, I'll never write a line of code without doing positioning first. And that was music to my ears. I think positioning comes first, but in any case, you do that first, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. And then you write a naming brief and it's really simple.

Arielle Jackson (00:20:07):
What are you naming? Are you naming a company? Are you naming the product? Are you naming both? Usually if you're early stage company, you're naming both and they're going to have one name because you don't want people to have to remember two things. What do you want the name to communicate? So in that example of Seesaw, we wanted it to communicate young childhood. In the example of Eero, we wanted it to communicate design, being designed forward. It can be whatever you want it to communicate. What do you want to avoid? We don't want it to sound like this competitor, or we hate this word or whatever you want to avoid. What are the names of competitive and related products? And then are there other considerations? I worked with another First Round company that was operating in China.

Arielle Jackson (00:20:53):
And one of the considerations was this has to be pronounceable for a native Chinese speaker. That's a very valid, additional consideration. And then there are seven criteria for names that always apply in my opinion. And you could add additional ones, like that Chinese speaking one would be an additional one. The seven are trademark, which is kind of obvious, can you use this? Are you violating someone else's trademark? And the second step with trademark is, do you need to proactively protect the name? Domain availability, so everyone gets hung up on getting a.com like maven.com got maven.com. It was an arduous process that Gogan wrote about on Twitter. But these days, you don't necessarily need the.com. Square operated on SquareUp for very, very long time. Lots of companies are operating on variants of a .com. So domain availability, distinctiveness. Is it memorable?

Arielle Jackson (00:21:51):
Is it sound like someone else's name? That's I think one of the most important ones, just is it different and distinctive? Is it timeless? So there's a lot of naming trends. If you tell me Optimizely I could tell you what year was the company formed when it ends in LY. If you tell me a word like Flicker, I can tell you what year it was, because that was the naming trend to remove vowels. So I generally stay away from naming trends, because I want your company named not to sound dated in 10 or 20 years. The last one is it's kind of related to that. What we talked about in the brief, what do you want the name to communicate? Which is the name reflective of your key messaging or does it somehow suggest an emotion or feeling that you're trying to convey, and then sound and ease of pronunciation.

Arielle Jackson (00:22:44):
Is it fun to say, is it easy to say, how is it to spell? We almost named a First Round company a while ago Lattice which is now a different company that's doing quite well, but we didn't name it that because this was a company that was B2B sales was going to be their main channel. So they're going to be people on the phone being like, hey, I'm calling from Lattice and we went through this exercise and we're like lettuce? It's not so easy to say and spell. So we actually didn't name the company that and went with something else. But there's a company now doing quite well.

Lenny (00:23:16):
You think that was the right move?

Arielle Jackson (00:23:18):
I don't know. I always say a good name is only going to help you, but a bad name won't hurt a good company. So I don't really feel-

Lenny (00:23:25):
Interesting. Good to know. Yeah. Keep going.

Arielle Jackson (00:23:27):
And then the last two are appearance. So there are some names that just lend themselves really nicely to visual design and they have to do with how tall the letters are and is their symmetry and if you give this to designer, making a logo just so awesome and cool and fun and then length. So a lot of people, they want to name like Square and Stripe and these one syllable names, but a two syllable or even a three syllable name can often be more memorable.

Lenny (00:23:57):
lennysnewsletter.com. Shoot.

Arielle Jackson (00:24:00):
Yeah. Well, so you got the Lenny part with the two syllables is generally a nice sweet spot.

Lenny (00:24:07):
Sweet. Have you put out a template or anything that folks can find to do this? Or should they kind of listen here and take notes?

Arielle Jackson (00:24:15):
Yeah, there's an article on the First Round review called Positioning Your Startup is Vital, Here's How to Nail It and all those criteria and how to do naming is actually in that article.

Lenny (00:24:27):
Awesome. We'll put that in our little show notes. And then as you go through this, is this a binary thing or you kind of rate each of these categories one to five?

Arielle Jackson (00:24:36):
Yeah. So the way I do it is I apply the criteria after we do the brainstorm. And then we do red, yellow, green on each of those criteria just to weed out ones that are not doing well on any of those. Got it. And then you add your own criteria. So the next steps the brainstorm. I'm going to go fast through this.

Lenny (00:24:55):
Yeah. I was going to ask you about the brainstorm. I'm excited to hear this.

Arielle Jackson (00:24:57):
Yeah. So the way that I run a naming process is I like to first do positioning and then I set up an hour with the founders and me and ideally a couple other people who are interested, but disinterested. So I'll bring a writer from the First Round team or the founder has a friend who's a linguist or the founder has a friend who speaks four languages. We like those kind of people to be in it if possible. And it's generally five to seven people in a brainstorm. And the idea is we spend one hour, I set it up beforehand and we try to come up with hundreds and hundreds of bad ideas and a couple decent ones that are worth exploring more. And the brainstorm is two parts. The first part is based on words in your positioning statement.

Arielle Jackson (00:25:40):
So we take all the meaningful words out of your positioning statement is the warmup and we run synonyms, antonyms, free associations, other languages, whatever we can do off of those words. And so if your words in your positioning statement are related to what that you do, which they very well should be, that's a great way to just come up with hundreds of words really quickly. And then the second step is a thematic brainstorm. So I pick between seven and 10 themes, you can think of them like Jeopardy themes. So it's like, I don't know, okay, so there was an-

Lenny (00:26:11):
Source.

Arielle Jackson (00:26:11):
... AI. Yeah. It was like an AI tool for strawberry picking and the themes would be the history of strawberry farming or botany 101, things that are related. You could do like last names of famous farmers, think about how did Tesla get their name? They probably did last names of people related to electricity, and that's such a great name, so thematic brainstorm. And then that's usually a little more fruitful. And we do the same thing, free association, all that.

Arielle Jackson (00:26:40):
I spend some time afterwards on Wikipedia and the internet and actually finding words words. Also love the library, check out books sometimes and just read books on the topic and just write down the interesting words that come up. And anyway, so then I give them back a short list. The short list is around 10 to 25 concepts that are ideas that are worth looking at further. And from there narrow it down based on the criteria and the red, yellow, green, we come up with three to five, don't come up with one because you might not get it for trademark, and it's really sad when you get really attached to one and then you can't use it. So yeah, three to five top contenders. And then you go through trademark process domain and kind of go from there.

Lenny (00:27:23):
That was amazing. If you're doing a startup name versus a product, is the process any different or is it basically the same?

Arielle Jackson (00:27:29):
No, same. The only difference is if you have a lot of equity in your company name... Square is a good example. Square had a lot of equity. Google is a perfect example. A lot of equity in the company name, you often don't want to name your products something really creative and different because you actually want the equity in the master brand to come through. So if you think about Square's names, they have other ones, when they diverge from the Square brand like cash or when they want something new or Google, when they came out with Android and they wanted to diverge from the master brand. But think about all the products. Square Register, Square Stand, Square App, Google Maps, they're really boring and it's because the equity is in the company name and the product name can actually be boring and descriptive.

Lenny (00:28:20):
That makes sense. I want to come back to a point you made that a great name will help a startup and a bad name is not going to hurt you or I forget the word to use. I'd love to hear that because that's that's really interesting.

Arielle Jackson (00:28:33):
Yeah. So if your company has a great name and the name is remarkable, people will be like, oh, that's a great name, or it just makes sense. In the case of Seesaw like, that's a good name for that company. That good name is just going to help people talk about it. It's going to spread word of mouth. People are going to like to talk about the company. If you think about there's a lot of companies with bad names that we use all the time or even quite boring names that we now love. So if you think about Disney, Walt Disney's last name, it didn't mean anything, but over time that's such a good company and it got imbued with all this meaning and now it stands for magic and stands for so much, but it was just the dude's last name. So over time a word can come to mean something that is beyond what that actual word means.

Arielle Jackson (00:29:21):
Disney means magic today. Volvo means safety. Those names are not good. If I just put it in a spreadsheet or one of those lists, no one would pick it. So that's kind of what I mean that the name is just part of the overall marketing or the overall brand and a bad name with a really great company with great company strategy, great marketing is going to be great over time. And a good name is just going to help you, but I don't think a bad name is going to kill a good company.

Lenny (00:29:51):
So interesting. So basically your goal is to help find a name that will help. Worst case, you're going to be okay if your product is awesome.

Arielle Jackson (00:29:59):
I think so. Yeah. I mean it also takes a little of the pressure off to be honest. Everyone wants to find that perfect name. If you actually think about it, this happens a lot. You give someone a list of 10 names or 15 names and they're just cells in the spreadsheet these days, we're doing most of this virtually. You give people a name like that and it's like, you have to imagine what it could be. You think about Apple or Disney or Nike or Volvo, Lego, any of these brands, in a cell spreadsheet in plain Arial in 10 point, they're just okay, you have to grow them over time. You just hear about I think Phil Nate with Nike, when he was given that name as an option, he was like, that's okay. Yeah. I'll sleep on it. Such a great name.

Lenny (00:30:50):
This makes me think about my startup back in the day, it was called Local Mind, and we went through an exercise similar to this. Not nearly as in depth and well run, but I remember our designer was the person that helped us nail the name. He's just like, oh, I could do so much with this name. Let's just see where this one can go. Is that something you find?

Arielle Jackson (00:31:10):
Yeah. There's definitely been bad names. I helped a company rebrand recently that they had a bad name. It just looked dated. It didn't fit any of those. It wasn't distinctive. It wasn't timeless. It had one of those like naming trends. Those are not good. You want to avoid those, but if you come up with something that is pretty good and you can make up something beautiful out of it and it fits your company, it does some of the marketing work for you and people like to say it and ideally it's memorable and it has some emotion to it, go, go for it.

Lenny (00:31:39):
Awesome. One last question about naming. What's a common mistake that people make going through this process coming up with a name?

Arielle Jackson (00:31:47):
Yeah, a really funny one is if you have a code name for your product or at First Round, a lot of the companies we invest in, they raise their seed round with one name. They may or may not be attached to it, but then they work with me and I'm like, yeah, your name's not that good, and here's why, we should probably change it or they say, we can't use this name. We found out we have a trademark conflict. I really believe in using a code name that's so ridiculous that you won't ever launch a product like that if you're just trying to incorporate and go really quick.

Arielle Jackson (00:32:18):
So for example, a lot of people, they need their name for their corporation. And so they are filing all the steps to creating a business and they just like pick something, but then they end up getting attached to it and then they want to actually launch under that name. And it's like, well, that's not so great and here's why I think you should change it. If you pick something so ridiculous that you would never launch, it's actually helpful because then you can go through a process and find a name that will do more of your work for you and you won't be attached to something crappy.

Lenny (00:32:50):
Such a good point an idea. And by the way, so if you're a First Round company, you get this naming service for free and all these other things we're going to talk about just to be clear.

Arielle Jackson (00:32:59):
Yes, that's right.

Lenny (00:33:00):
Oh my God. I could do a whole episode about how much I love First Round, but I will say I'm a huge fan. I think I've participated in every program that First Round offers. The First Round review is actually one of the first pieces of writing that kind of helped spur my now career. And so I'm really-

Arielle Jackson (00:33:15):
I remember that article, was awesome.

Lenny (00:33:17):
Yeah. And I did two more after that. So much work, but yeah, that was a big deal. So I'm really appreciative to First Round. And we could talk about First Round a bit at the end, too.

Arielle Jackson (00:33:26):
Sure. Yeah. Everything we're talking about that you've asked me so far, I think that you're going to ask me about positioning and [inaudible 00:33:33] your marketing person, and all of that is stuff we offer to First Round company, we offer my services as part of the investment. There are times when we might get stuck and we have to bring in an outside person to help us with something, but for the most part, it's all included and you'd pay a lot of money... The naming firm I like the best when I get stuck, it's called A Hundred Monkeys. They're awesome. A long time ago, I used to be like, oh yeah, it's about $25,000. And I recently couldn't take on an outsider First Round project and referred it to them. It's $47,000 for a name.

Lenny (00:34:04):
Wow.

Arielle Jackson (00:34:05):
So yeah, it's gotten expensive, but if you have the means, it's nice to get some outside help.

Lenny (00:34:12):
#valueadd. Okay. I want to transition to your brand development framework, which I read a bunch about. And I know you teach a course about this, which we could also chat a bit about, but first I'm curious, just practically, why is a brand useful? Why is it even something people should spend time investing in? Why does it matter?

Arielle Jackson (00:34:33):
Okay. So a lot of founders may think that when we say your brand, we mean your logo and your font and your colors, and that is a visual expression of your brand, but it's not actually your brand, your brand is who people think you are. And so why is it important for people to think what you want them to think? That really comes down to people's understanding and particularly your target audience's understanding of what your company and your product is. And I don't really think there's anything else more important than that if I was building a company.

Arielle Jackson (00:35:08):
So your brand is who people think you are and developing a brand strategy is what do you want to be? What do you want people to think you are? And what are you going to do to help shape that perception? So when I work on a company, there's a lot of steps to this, but I kind of have this nice little process that's right sized for early stage startups. And I like to start with, why do you do what you do? Just having a really clear understanding of that. That's your purpose. The second part is your product positioning. So meaning how do you want people to understand your product and what role it plays in their lives? And then the last part is your personality, which is how do you show up in the world? What do you like? If your brand was a person, would I want to hang out with them? Would someone else want to hang out with them?

Lenny (00:36:02):
We're going to get into each of these three pieces, but before we get in there, as a founder, how do you know when you're done with your brand development? I know it's a never ending ongoing process, but at the end of a process, you figure out your purpose, positioning, and personality, and then there's logo and colors, when you think about just here's the brand package, what are all the little pieces of it? And then we'll dive into these three elements.

Arielle Jackson (00:36:30):
I think what you said is right. You get those three components, your purpose, your positioning, your personality, you use that as an informant to your visual design and also to your tone of voice. So the way your copy sounds, the way you show up in written copy. A lot of companies have what they call like a style guide or a brand style guide and it really only covers logo, fonts, colors, like don't put our logo and blue, don't tilt it on an angle, here's what it looks like in white, here's what it looks like in black, here's the favicon, but they don't have that for here's who we are, here's 10 lines that could be ad copy for us, here is why we do what we do.

Arielle Jackson (00:37:14):
This is the personality of our brand. Here are five attributes. We are playful, but not silly. We can talk about that a little bit more. But I think all of that belongs in the style guide, not just logo, font colors, which is really just a visual articulation that feeds into your brand. I'm a big Volvo fan. I'm on my fourth Volvo right now. So I'm super brand loyal. And I always use them as an example, because if you can picture the Volvo logo in your head right now, it kind of looks like the male symbol, it's like a circle with an arrow coming off the side.

Arielle Jackson (00:37:48):
There's nothing about that logo that means all the things I like about Volvo, all the things that the Volvo brand has come to mean to me and they're colors, they're like black and white and a little blue. There's nothing more boring than their color palette. And so it's not the logo and the font and the colors of Volvo that has made them mean... They literally own the word safety in cars right now. It's other stuff. And if you looked at their style guide actually, looked at their style guide recently and it's just like, here's our black and our white and our blue and here's our tertiary colors and here's our logo. It would not help you understand Volvo as a brand.

Lenny (00:38:29):
I'm guessing some of that happened because they've evolved over the years and it's probably a very different initial brand. So it kind of tells me that it's more important to have a logo and a brand that can kind of represent many things that isn't so stuck in a certain positioning, maybe. Does that resonate at all?

Arielle Jackson (00:38:44):
Yeah. Their logo has to do with a very early history. I researched this because I was a nerd out on this stuff. They had some early history as a ball bearings company. And so I guess that logo had some meaning then, but it wasn't so descriptive to being a ball bearing company that they were able to keep it as they evolved into a car company.

Arielle Jackson (00:39:05):
But if you look at their early writing, it's so cool. It's so cool. Long, long time ago they would talk about cars are driven by humans. And our job as a car manufacturer is to protect the humans who drive the cars. That was fundamental formation of the company. So they really knew why they existed. And then they did stuff in I think it was the 1950s when everyone just wore lap bands in the car and they came out with the three point safety harness and instead of patenting it and licensing it, they gave that away for free for everyone because that would make all the world's cars safer and those kinds of company decisions. That's what made Volvo stand for safety. It's not the logo.

Lenny (00:39:48):
Very interesting.

Lenny (00:39:50):
This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris, and Lex Fridman, and so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One with a small scoop that dissolves in water. You are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on latest science research studies and internal testing that they do.

Lenny (00:40:39):
And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day. And that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. Make it easy. Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:41:10):
Again, that's athletic greens.com/lenny to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

Lenny (00:41:18):
One question on my mind before we get into these three elements, last question kind of setting context is if I'm a non founder or a PM, I'm just like, oh my God, a branding exercise is going to take months going to suck up all these resources. I don't know what it's going to do for us. What kind of timeframe do you recommend for early stage companies to go through kind of a branding exercise and go through something like this and maybe even later stage, what's reasonable?

Arielle Jackson (00:41:45):
Yeah. It depends on the stage of your company and how much you have already that you have to kind of... It's hard for people to scrap up what they already have. There's a lot of sunk cost fallacy type stuff going on. If you're starting from nothing, I think you can do this in three weeks. The naming process itself because of trademark and domains can take a little longer. When I name companies, it usually takes about a month just for naming, but the whole brand strategy process you could do, if you're a really early stage company in a matter of weeks.

Arielle Jackson (00:42:15):
And I think whatever time it takes you actually is going to save you so much time down the road. It's going to help you save time on company decision making. It's going to help you save time, writing your website. Literally your web copy almost writes itself, if you get this all done right. So it's a small investment of time up front that actually saves you a lot of time down the road is how I would sell it to a skeptical PM.

Lenny (00:42:40):
You've sold it. That sounds very high ROI. Let's get into it.

Arielle Jackson (00:42:43):
High ROI.

Lenny (00:42:43):
So purpose is the first piece. What is that? And then what are some examples of really good executions of purpose that you've seen?

Arielle Jackson (00:42:50):
Sure. So your purpose is why you do what you do. It makes people want to root for you. And it has a big role in aligning people to come want to work for you and to have employees all feel like they're part of something. I like to think of it as we exist to blank. And whatever that blank is your purpose. Do you want to hear about examples or do you want to hear about what makes a good purpose?

Lenny (00:43:14):
Both would be most excellent.

Arielle Jackson (00:43:16):
So a good purpose, it explains the change you want to see in the world irrespective of financial gain. So people often get hung up on mission and vision and values and all this stuff. And values are fine. They're internal. I'm not going to talk about those today, but I don't care about mission and vision. I just want one thing because people can only remember one thing and it's your purpose and it's why you do what you do. And when you articulate this really well, it helps you make company decisions, it exists on a 10 year frame. So everything we talk about with product positioning, it's pretty malleable. It exists on an 18 month frame if you're a early stage company, so it can evolve, whereas your purpose is pretty much going to stay the same for 10 years. It's that north star.

Arielle Jackson (00:44:03):
And it helps align people in the company and it helps the public want you to win. I worked at Google right out of grad school and Google's purpose was to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And I thought every company had a purpose that everyone at the company knew. I just thought that was my first real job. It turns out that's not true. And Google's actually been amazing at this. I had a person in my last cohort who had recently left Google when they were like, I don't know, 80 or a hundred thousand people. He said everyone still can say that. That's amazing. But I joined, it was like 1400 people. And by the time of your first day, you already knew that. It was part of your hiring process.

Arielle Jackson (00:44:51):
It was part of your onboarding. It was in your offer letter. It was everywhere. And I just thought that was really cool and a good purpose. One that is kind of related to financial gain, but I still think is cool is Stripe's, which is to increase the GDP of the internet. I think that's really well said and cool and just gets you thinking about the internet as a country. I don't know. If you're an internet person, it makes you want to root for them.

Arielle Jackson (00:45:21):
Nike's is awesome. I wrote Nike's down because I don't remember it, to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And if you have a body, you are an athlete. It's not just about LeBron it's about me and how was my Peloton ride this morning too? So those are some famous companies. I could tell you a little bit about some that I've worked on that I think are pretty cool that are companies you may not have heard of yet, just because sometimes we get hung up in like thinking Stripe and Nike and Google are awesome names because of all the meaning we have behind them. And I want to talk about some companies you may not have heard of because you can have a good purpose and not be Stripe and Nike and Google.

Lenny (00:46:07):
Yeah. That'd be awesome. And by the way, the purpose, should it be a sentence? Is that the general-

Arielle Jackson (00:46:08):
Yes.

Lenny (00:46:08):
... guideline. Great.

Arielle Jackson (00:46:09):
So you can introduce yourself at a conference. You're the keynote speaker at a conference and I want you to introduce yourself and I want you to go, hi, I'm Lenny, I'm the founder of the company X, and we exist to blah and say it and have that feel natural.

Lenny (00:46:21):
Awesome.

Arielle Jackson (00:46:22):
And it should make people want to hear what else you have to say. And the other thing it should be able to do is be the header for your about page. So meaning we exist to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But you would just take out the we exist and say the verb and start there. That could be the header for your about page. So one company I worked on, First Round company, they're called LogicLoop and it's an operations automation company.

Arielle Jackson (00:46:48):
You can think of it almost stuff like a no code, low code platform to automate a lot of the operations data based work that people have to do. And we did this whole brainstorm and I really liked their purpose. You can look at their about page. It will be right there it's to make operations data work harder than operations people. And if you ever have worked in operations or have friends who have, they work really, really hard and it can be kind of thankless. So it gets anyone in that field to root for you. Your data should be working harder than your operations people.

Lenny (00:47:21):
Disclaimer, I'm an investor in LogicLoop, and I love that you worked with them.

Arielle Jackson (00:47:24):
Cool. Awesome. And then another one that I worked on of another First Round company, they're called Woolf. They're informed by the UC model where there's a bunch of individual schools that all exist by themselves, but they get something from being part of a larger organization. And what they do is they provide accreditation through being part of the larger Woolf University, but every individual college can still operate as their own independent college.

Arielle Jackson (00:47:52):
And so their purpose is to increase access to world class higher education and ensure that it is globally recognized and transferable. So this idea of you should be able to take a class from the best instructor online and then go travel to Australia and take a class there and then go to China and take a class there and get the best education that the world can offer.

Arielle Jackson (00:48:15):
Another one that I worked on a while ago is Alt. I think they've recently gone through a little bit of like a rebranding, but theirs was to increase the transparency and liquidity of alternative assets. And in their case, the product positioning was really about making sports cards as easy to invest in as stocks. So the idea of alternative assets in this case are not private equity and hedge funds in real estate, but alternatives to alternatives, like sports cards and Pokemon cards and art.

Lenny (00:48:45):
Awesome. Those are so many awesome examples. That's going to be useful for people to wrap their head around what a purpose might be. Execution wise, do you just kind of open up a Google doc and just start writing out ideas and brainstorm a little bit and just kind of keep refining with your team?

Arielle Jackson (00:48:58):
I actually stole this exercise or borrowed it from [inaudible 00:49:03] that I actually think adds some structure to that. If you do it that way and it works for you, that's awesome. But if you want to go in and go through a process to get there, what I like to do is list all of the cultural tensions that are happening in the world that are relevant to your business first. And so for Alt, that would be things like there's an increase in interest in alternatives. People who are now in their 30s are nostalgic for things that happened in the '90s There is at the time really low interest rates and people are not getting any sort of edge off of investing in the things that their parents used to invest in. So those would be examples of cultural tensions. Cultural tensions are zeitgeist, their things that your audience might be thinking of.

Arielle Jackson (00:49:51):
They're things that they may be even subconscious to them, their current events. So you make a long list of all of those. Then you make a long list of all the ways that you might describe your brand's best self. And this is related to your product positioning, but let's say you haven't done yet, so just think of it as your brand's best self. How would we want someone to describe us? When everything works perfectly, and our product really delivers, what does it deliver? And again, bullets, just ways that you would talk about that. And then you pick one from each side, that's really the best articulation of what's happening in the world, what your product delivers, and with that context, now you're primed.

Arielle Jackson (00:50:30):
With that context in mind, now you do the brainstorm of, we exist to let me finish this sentence, and even before you get there, sometimes it's helpful to do the world would be a better place if. So for my company, the world would be a better place if, and finish that sentence and then go into the we exist to.

Lenny (00:50:49):
Wow. I'm so happy I asked that question. By the way, is there also a place we can point people to that want to do this exercise? Is there another First Round interview post, or I know you have a course on this too.

Arielle Jackson (00:50:59):
Yeah. There's another First Round review article it's called Three Moves Every Startup Founder Should Make, something like that

Lenny (00:51:07):
Great. I will find it and I'll add it.

Arielle Jackson (00:51:09):
Yeah. Okay. Awesome.

Lenny (00:51:10):
Amazing. Okay. Let's move on to the next part, which is around positioning, which is a big deal. First, just what is positioning? And then I'd love to know just what tells you may have a positioning problem, that's something you should really focus on?

Arielle Jackson (00:51:23):
Okay. So positioning is the space that you occupy in your target customer's mind and everything you can do to influence how they describe your product. You have a positioning problem if I ask 10 of your customers or 10 of your employees what the company does or what the product does. And I get multiple answers. And unfortunately that's the case for most companies. It's okay if the answers are tiny slight variance on the same thing, but I have actually done this with some later stage companies [inaudible 00:52:01] my first step is often I go in and I interview 10 people, and the 10 people are everyone from execs to people who talk to customers to a few customers. And when you get 10 people saying 10 wildly different things, you have a positioning problem. Other ways you might know that if you have a positioning problem is if you can't explain what you do to me in a sentence that's, you have a positioning problem.

Lenny (00:52:25):
That's a high bar.

Arielle Jackson (00:52:26):
Yeah, it is. And when I first started consulting, I would spend the first meeting with a founder, just totally cold. Hey, tell me about your company. And they would take 30 minutes to tell me about their company. And at the end of 30 minutes, I would pretty much get it, but it always took the first 30 minutes. So now when I engage with a new company, I have them fill out this little worksheet beforehand. And one of the questions is what do you do? And they have to write in a box that's kind of paragraph length.

Lenny (00:52:55):
Clever.

Arielle Jackson (00:52:56):
And then I go in and I ask questions about that. And ultimately we get it to sentence length.

Lenny (00:53:00):
Amazing. Okay. How do you go about figuring out your positioning? Big question.

Arielle Jackson (00:53:05):
Yeah. So I start with your audience. Who's this for? And we really think about what's the broadest set of customers or users that you might have and narrow in from there to a target audience, which is who are you outwardly going to try to acquire for the next 18 months?

Arielle Jackson (00:53:25):
You can think of it like concentric circles. The biggest circle is your TAM. As you get smaller, there's five parts to it. So the biggest circle is circle one, circle two, circle three, circle four is your target audience. All of the circles have to be contained within the bigger circle. And then the dot in the middle is your model persona. So this is actually like a person with a name and an age and a location and a job and feelings and priorities and interests and all of that.

Arielle Jackson (00:53:54):
And so we talk about the model user and the target audience, the target audience again is who will you outwardly try to acquire for the next 18 months? If you're an early stage company, it's very possible that you're going to acquire people outside of that circle, in the next circle or even the bigger circle, but they're not who you're actively going out to try to acquire.

Lenny (00:54:15):
Can I ask you a couple questions on the person?

Arielle Jackson (00:54:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:18):
I'm doing some writing and research into this stuff. How specific do you suggest people get with this person right at the middle? I love that it's an actual person, I guess not a real person, but a very descriptive [crosstalk 00:54:29]

Arielle Jackson (00:54:29):
Can be a real person or an amalgamation of not real people. So with the target audience, I like to think of it as something you could name. So with Eero, it was tech savvy dads. It's a category of people. And then the model persona, or that individual user who represents a tech savvy dad for them was this guy who had teenage kids lived in suburban St. Louis, had a 2,800 Square foot house that was made of brick, worked at home on Fridays. His kids were into gaming. He was the VP of sales at a company that was tech adjacent, but not tech. He was more of like a tech enthusiast than an actual software engineer. We knew a lot about him. I could tell you a lot about him. It's kind of robust, but tech savvy dads was the way to represent him and other people like him, that would be their target audience.

Lenny (00:55:22):
A lot of founders have trouble recognizing that going very focused and niche is a good idea versus man, I'm just going to have these 10 people in the world that really want what I want. What have you found to be the reason it's very powerful and important to start really focused?

Arielle Jackson (00:55:37):
Yeah. So when you are an early stage company, the worst thing you can do is try to be everything to everyone because you don't have enough runway. You just don't have enough of anything to do that successfully. The best thing you can do is find an audience that is big enough, that if you got your significant market share among that audience, you'd be a giant business. And tech savvy dads is a pretty big audience. Also that's just who your outbound going to try to acquire for the next 18 months. I'm a tech savvy mom. I live with a tech savvy dad. I have an Eero system. It doesn't mean everyone you'll ever acquire must be in that audience, it means that is who we're focused on acquiring.

Lenny (00:56:24):
Awesome. I took us off course around the positioning process. I think we kind of went off course with concentric circles model. So I'll give it back to you to keep going.

Arielle Jackson (00:56:36):
Yeah. Okay. So the way that I like to run positioning exercise is to start with who is this for? And then what is the problem that they have? There's some problem usually that these people have, they may not even be aware it's a problem, or they may not be experiencing the problem as particularly troubling, but there's something going on for these people. And then how do they address that problem today? So they do something, they're buying something, they're have a workaround, they're doing something today. And that something might not be another startup or your direct competitor. It might be the old way of doing things, but they're doing something. So we go through who is it for? What's their problem? How do they address it? And then what do you make?

Arielle Jackson (00:57:20):
How does it work? And what would you want a user of your product or service to tell another? And that's kind of if you answer all of those questions, it ultimately leads into this classic four statement, which is not something I invented, it's something that's been around for 40 or 50 years. And I learned it when I was 22. And I think it's one of the most powerful tools in marketing. It can feel like mad libs if you just approach it cold. But if you've gone through that work of defining who is it and what's their problem, all it is a distillation of that. So that statement is for target audience who there's a statement of need or opportunity. And then you say our product name is a category that has a benefit, unlike the old thing they were doing, our product works this other way.

Lenny (00:58:10):
Awesome. And we'll link to the post that actually has that so people don't have to write this all down. That last piece you mentioned, I hadn't heard before, the idea of what will they tell other people or how will they describe it to other people? Is that right?

Arielle Jackson (00:58:22):
Yeah. So I believe that great benefits if you've defined your benefit really, really well will actually be the thing that will be the H1 on your homepage and will be the thing that you want someone to tell someone else. Think about Square Stand and turn your iPad into a point of sale. Turn your iPad into a point of sale. Yeah. If I went to a small business owner and they were having drinks with a friend, who's also a small business owner, what would I want them to say about the Square Stand? Oh yeah. I just got the Square Stand. It's this really cool new register that turns my iPad into a point of sale. That's pretty much exactly what I want them to say. And so if you can write that line, that is your ideal benefit, what you want people to say, and it's something that your target audience would actually say, that's great.

Lenny (00:59:12):
Interesting. I love that. That makes a lot of sense. For people trying to go through this exercise, you always have such a good answers to how actually the process of coming up with say you're positioning this case, is it again, you pull up a doc and start writing things or is there something even more structured?

Arielle Jackson (00:59:28):
Yeah. There's something more structured. I have kind of a worksheet that goes through all those things we just talked about. So it's like, who is it for? What are they doing today? All those questions we just talked about, it's more like a structured brainstorm. There's an exercise I really love that I've called the bar test that is helping you get everything you've written into human language because one of the really big pitfalls I see, especially for B2B companies, but really for everyone is they write in a way that people don't talk. So the document, when I get the first draft back from founders often has things like leverages and empowers and nobody talks like that. And so getting this into turns your iPad into a point of sale blankets your home in fast, reliable wifi, records your screen and cam at the same time, really basic stuff that it describes your product in a way that someone would actually say that's the type of language that I think people want to use.

Arielle Jackson (01:00:28):
First of all, you defined your target. Now you pretend to be someone in your target, having drinks with someone else in your target at a bar and you have to be able to say, hey, I just started using product name. It's this really great category, that benefit. And the other person goes, hm, tell me more or that's cool, what do you mean? Or some other similar prompts. And then you have to say your differentiator. You actually have to say it out loud. And if you run through that test and it's actually stuff people would say out loud, then you've done a pretty good job and you can start using that copy publicly.

Lenny (01:01:07):
That is very cool. I have not heard this bar test before and I like that it might happen at an actual bar. Is that also something people can find online or is that they write it down right now?

Arielle Jackson (01:01:18):
Ooh, I don't know if that's online.

Lenny (01:01:20):
Okay, cool. This is it. Exclusive.

Arielle Jackson (01:01:22):
Yeah, that's in my course, and we talk a lot about that and we go through the exercise like a real role play in the course, but yeah, take some notes.

Lenny (01:01:31):
I like that a lot.

Arielle Jackson (01:01:33):
Thanks.

Lenny (01:01:33):
Your point reminded me of an email I just pulled up that I got from ADP, your point about just you want to make sure you're branding is something that feels like something you would say to a person. So it's like ADP, which is a security service for fire, like alarms. I got this email, summer's on with fun or our free secure app and more. And then it's like make summer safer and more fun at home or away. ADP, you're not going to make it more fun. What are you talking about?

Arielle Jackson (01:02:01):
See, that's an example of trying too hard. They tried too hard to make it sound colloquial and fun. They're a security system, it should be more like secure your home while you're away. Feel safe when you're on your summer trip. Stuff like that.

Lenny (01:02:16):
They even included a gif of this TikTok'er being like ADP is my MVP.

Arielle Jackson (01:02:21):
Yeah. This kind of relates to brand personality where the brand personality for ADP, I don't know, it's pretty not fun. And so for them, when they put on fun hat, it seems awkward and forced.

Lenny (01:02:36):
That's exactly the feeling I got. And so, yeah, personality, that's our next topic. It's not something I you think about when you think about brand and marketing and plans and so I'm really curious to hear why I think that's important then how to figure out your own personality for your brand.

Arielle Jackson (01:02:51):
So I think personality is one of those inputs that will help define your visual design and it will definitely help define your written copy. And it really comes from this idea of brands are like people. And if you start thinking of your brand more like a person, it's quite obvious that it needs a personality, because all people have personalities. And these days, especially when brands show up in places where people show up, like TikTok and Instagram, your brand certainly needs a personality or else you end up like ADP trying to be fun for the summer, which just feels really off and weird. So personality is one of those things that it's actually the easiest part. I think it's the fastest part. It often ends up an hour and you can get it done. But I have some frameworks I like to use that really just get at are you Mountain Dew or are you Rolex or are you somewhere in between?

Arielle Jackson (01:03:46):
And when you think about brands that have a lot of equity, they really do have a personality. I often talk about Mountain Dew marketing as that marketing that's like trying really hard to be cool and rugged and edgy and fast and kind of teen and Rolex, it's very like Gray Poupon, oh, roll down your window and do you have any Gray Poupon, it's fancy and sophisticated and a little bit aspirational and maybe even a little British. And those two things are really, really, really different. And there's a lot in the middle and not everyone's going to be a Mountain Dew or Rolex, but where are you? And so you can just write it down. I think a lot of these answers come back to like, if you are good with just opening a blank Google doc and like writing down who you are by all means, go for it.

Arielle Jackson (01:04:35):
And if that feels daunting and hard for you, use a framework. And the framework that I like to use has two parts. The first part is based on some academic research by Jennifer Aker and it basically analyzed the top brands in the world and figured out that all brands can be segmented into five dimensions of brand personality. And that really strong brand spike in two of the five. So the five dimensions that she found were sincerity, so this is like, is it down to earth and honest, excitement, it's spirited, this is a Mountain Dew thing, competence, reliable and intelligent, sophisticated, sophistication, which is a charming and upper class and rugged outdoorsy and tough. So sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness. And going back to those two brands we just discussed Mountain Dew is rugged and exciting, Rolex is sophisticated and competent and you can do this with any brand who admire or just think about brands you like and kind of deduce them to their two of those five.

Arielle Jackson (01:05:39):
So that's the first step. Which two of those five are you going to spike in? And it turns out a lot of tech companies end up spiking in sincerity and competence just usually does happen that way. Amazon is sincere and competent. Google is sincere and competent. Apple is not, Apple has a little more of that sophistication to it. But in any case, if you just did that, we would end in a world where everyone's sincere and competent or maybe sophisticated and competent. It's like a really boring world. So the next step after you do that is to define five attributes, five brand personalities, thinking about those two dimensions. I like to think about this as a star, five point star and brands need tension to be interesting. So if you tell me we're helpful, we're nice, we're approachable, we're competent, and we're reliable.

Arielle Jackson (01:06:37):
You basically haven't told me anything because you just use three words to say one thing and two words to say another thing. Whereas if you tell me, oh, well we're really savvy, but we're also really approachable. That's kind of cool. Because people who are expert are always approachable. They have to have a little tension and then you want to write them as statements that say we are X, but not Y, where Y is taking X too far. So in the example Google is playful but not silly, so they would say we are playful, but not silly, or maybe Mountain Dew would say we are daring, but not stupid. So taking that attribute a little too far. And so yeah, then you end up with these five statements that are we are X, but not Y. And those are really useful in informing how you write and maybe even what your visual design would look like, and certainly what your illustration style photography style ad copy will be like.

Lenny (01:07:39):
Once you've gone through that exercise and in maybe the other two pieces, where do you put this? Is this just like in a doc that's like here's our brand overview, here's our personality, here's our positioning, here's our purpose. And then you refer back to that whenever you're designing and putting together strategies? Is that how it works?

Arielle Jackson (01:08:00):
Yeah, you could do it that way. That's definitely one way of doing it. That's a good start. I think that one other place where it shows up, like we talked about that visual style guide that everyone has, that they give to an agency or copywriter who's writing on their behalf. I think these should all be inputs into that doc that you end up sharing. I think it should go into any onboarding you do for new employees so that they understand who the company is. Any partners that you're marketing with, co-branding, all of that, it should really be think of it as your little brand Bible about who you are. And also it should be revisited when you're doing, let's say a new product or to make sure does this need to be updated or does this new product need to fit into who we are?

Lenny (01:08:40):
What do you call this document/place?

Arielle Jackson (01:08:44):
When I take all those three components and then add a bunch of other stuff, I call it a creative brief, which is the thing you would hand to an agency or a writer who's writing on your behalf. It would include some other things too, that we didn't talk about, like creative inspiration direction. So picking visual clips and written clips and all these things that you like and that you don't like, so you can show both positive examples and counter examples to the thing you're looking for.

Lenny (01:09:09):
Awesome. Thank you for all of that. There's so much juice there. I think people are going to have to listen to this a couple times to get all the learnings. Before I let you go, there's two other areas I wanted to dive into. But I'll keep them brief because I know we're going long. One is about getting PR and just a question I wanted to ask you while I had you, founders and even bigger companies, they're always like, how do I get PR? How do I get press for my product, even though it's sometimes a waste of time. Do you have just any tactical advice for startups hoping to get some PR?

Arielle Jackson (01:09:43):
You mean initial coverage around a launch or ongoing?

Lenny (01:09:47):
I'd say early on, yeah, before the launch.

Arielle Jackson (01:09:49):
Sure. So the first one is to get your story straight. So, so many times I have founders come to me and they're like, hey, we need help with this announcement. I'm like, cool. What's the announcement? And back to the 30 minutes until I understand what the company is, so if you can't describe it to me in a sentence, your reporter is certainly not going to understand in a sentence and they won't be able to describe it to their audience in a sentence. And so really getting your story straight, all the stuff we talked about specifically around product positioning is so key. Almost always when someone comes to me and says, I'm ready to announce, we go back to positioning first. Also make sure that your website is ready for the traffic you're going to drive to it, that you're not driving traffic to a name that you're going to later scrap.

Arielle Jackson (01:10:32):
Are you really ready for this? So go back to all the other things we discussed first and then having realistic expectations about the outlets that will cover you and the time it will take to get them. So a lot of people will be like, I'm launching next week. And it's like, well, cool that you're doing that, but no reporters going to cover you next week. It just doesn't work like that anymore. Five years ago, eight years ago, founders could really dictate the date of a launch announcement, they could brief three to five outlets under embargo, which means like you all can't tell our secret news until we tell you at this time you can publish. And at that time, three of the five would all file a story and write, and it just doesn't work like that anymore. These days for early stage startups, we're almost always running the launch announcement as an exclusive, which means you give the news to a single outlet.

Arielle Jackson (01:11:19):
And they're the only ones who get to write about it. You can obviously still do all your owned and operated stuff, your blog, your social, your investors, your friends and family, but they're the only like news outlet who gets to write about it. So having an expectation that this is probably going to be an exclusive, it's harder than ever to secure funding for a seed stage company and funding in and of itself is not that interesting anymore. There's so many bad companies getting funding. There's so many good companies getting funding too just more than ever. And the number of reporters and the number of outlets that are covering it is just less than it used to be. So really just thinking about like, well, who writes about this space? Do they write about company's at my stage?

Arielle Jackson (01:12:08):
That's another really big one is, hey, we want the New York Times. It's like, cool, no one's at the New York Times has ever covered a seed stage startup unless it's crazy for the last five years. Who do you think is going to write about you? But there are still outlets that do. The other one is don't do a straight funding announcement. A lot of founders raise money and they're like, cool, let's announce. It's like, no, we'll use that funding announcement as a news hook to tell a larger story and a larger story might be your products available. You have reference customers, you have momentum, you have some great partnership that you're announcing. There's something else going on, not just your funding and using your funding as part of that initial launch is great, but what else are you announcing?

Arielle Jackson (01:12:55):
The last thing is really about making what you do interesting and relevant so that it's not just interesting and relevant to you and the three other people who worked there at the time, but interesting to all the readers of whatever outlet you're trying to target. And so an example of that is I worked on this company, Vitable Health and the founder, Joseph, he created a product for hourly workers that their employer would buy and it costs like $50 per person per month. And what it does is it provides urgent care and primary care. So these hourly workers who make too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to pay their health insurance premiums, and so primary and urgent care for hourly workers. And we tied it into this idea of the great resignation and small businesses not being able to hire hourly workers, which was like a big trend end of 2021, and the company operates in Philadelphia and Delaware, and we were actually able to get him the Sunday after Christmas, Philadelphia Inquirer story.

Arielle Jackson (01:13:57):
But it was all about making this daycare and this restaurant in Philadelphia into heroes because they offered this cool benefit to their hourly workers. And so the headline was perfect for them, but it wasn't like here's Vitable and here's what they announced and here's, it was like, hey, look at this cool new thing that local businesses are doing to attract hourly workers. And so think about your company in a way to make it interesting and relevant and don't sleep on local preps.

Arielle Jackson (01:14:23):
If you have a local business or a local story or local customers, this was a huge thing at Square. We turned all of our customers into heroes and went after local press. Most PR firms that service the tech community aren't experts in local press, but if you have a way to make some connections with some local press, they are the ones hungry for these stories more than the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Lenny (01:14:50):
What a good tip and most likely they're much more open to writing about you versus New York Times or Wall Street Journal. Cool. Okay. So I want to ask you one question about hiring marketing real quick and I'll keep it short just because I know we're going to run out of time. When should a startup hire a full-time marketing person in your experience?

Arielle Jackson (01:15:08):
When you have a lot of problems that you're trying to solve that would be better solved by someone who knew what they're doing, or when you have a bunch of freelancers and agencies that are becoming too hard to manage by yourself.

Lenny (01:15:21):
When do you find that usually ends up being... Is there kind of a heuristic-

Arielle Jackson (01:15:25):
Yeah. Ballpark, it kind of depends if you're a marketing driven business or a sales driven business. So if you're a sales driven business and you don't have a repeatable sales motion, it's not yet time to hire a marketer, get that repeatable sales motion, and marketing's job is to bring you more marketing qualified leads. So that's one, so that kind of depends. If you're a marketing driven business, it generally seems to me like it happens around 10 people, the founders doing most of this themselves, they're not doing the best job usually or they've hired agency here, a freelancer there to kind of cobble some stuff together. And they now realize like, okay, if I had a person who would be able to do all of this and manage these agencies and freelancers, this would be a lot better.

Arielle Jackson (01:16:13):
It also is do you have a one point in time project? Do you need to do positioning? Do you need a website? Do you need a name? Do you need to run a test of Google ads? Those things are all discreet when it becomes this is ongoing work that needs to happen over time. It's better to think about hiring a marketer and really what kind of marketer do you need? Do you need a product marketer, a performance marketer, a comms person, a creative person? Ideally everyone wants all of that. But I kind of like that idea of a T-shaped marketer who's really deep on one of those functions, but knows enough to be dangerous across all of them.

Lenny (01:16:48):
I think we're going to need another episode just about that one topic. I have so many questions I want to ask, but I need to let you go. That'll be V2. Before we do that, we've gotten to the very exciting lightning round where I'm just going to ask you quick questions and you just give me a quick answer and we will knock through them all. Does that sound good?

Arielle Jackson (01:17:06):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:17:07):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Arielle Jackson (01:17:09):
In marketing land, definitely the book called Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. It's from 1980, it's still my favorite marketing book. Another recent marketing book is Alchemy by Rory Sutherland. It's like my favorite area of reading is behavioral science, psychology meets business. And that's in there. For fiction, I just read The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett. It was awesome. I then read her other book called The Mothers, but I think The Vanishing Half's better.

Lenny (01:17:36):
Awesome. I will check that out. What's a favorite podcast or even newsletter on marketing?

Arielle Jackson (01:17:41):
I love Nick Sharma's weekly newsletter. He's a growth marketer. He started his career I think at [inaudible 01:17:48] water. So he does a lot of CPG type DTC. He has a great marketing newsletter that comes out every Sunday night. On podcasts, I love How I Built This. I know that's already really popular, but I love that one. It's not really marketing, but just general business. The First Round podcast in depth is pretty great. Lenny's podcast I've been listening to is awesome. And then my friend Jasmine from The Concept Bureau has a marketing podcast called Unseen, Unknown. And it's kind of about culture and branding and how these things and society and trends. It's not like straight marketing. It's kind of more of the culture and sociology that informs marketing.

Lenny (01:18:30):
Wow. That is a lot of good stuff. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've loved?

Arielle Jackson (01:18:35):
This is more embarrassing. How many movies have you seen in the last year? Just curious.

Lenny (01:18:41):
Me? A lot, on streaming services. Way too many also, if that's where you're going or have you seen none?

Arielle Jackson (01:18:48):
Well, I've seen maybe four and they're probably all on Disney+.

Lenny (01:18:53):
You're winning. That's excellent.

Arielle Jackson (01:18:56):
I would say I really like some of those Disney Pixar movies, Luca, Encanto. Those are all really great. I mostly only watch movies with my kids, but I'm pretty excited. I had a celebrity crush on Anthony Bourdain and I'm excited to watch his new documentary if I ever get around to it. And TV shows I'm equally bad.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Okay, great.

Arielle Jackson (01:19:16):
And there's this little Netflix show called Old Enough. It's a Japanese show with subtitles about sending toddlers on errands in Japan. They like go by themselves. It's 10 minutes. They're awesome. My whole family watched them together. It's really cute.

Lenny (01:19:29):
Old Enough. I'm going to check that out. Okay. Two more questions. Favorite interview question when hiring a marketing person?

Arielle Jackson (01:19:35):
It's probably tell me a project you're proud of. Tell me about a project you're proud of, is just really open-ended and get to hear a lot about a lot of things that way. And then maybe runner up is tell me about a campaign you recently come across that you were not involved with that you thought was cool.

Lenny (01:19:53):
Hmm. Love that. Okay. Final question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?

Arielle Jackson (01:20:01):
In the marketing industry?

Lenny (01:20:02):
In the marketing industry? Yeah, sure.

Arielle Jackson (01:20:04):
I guess old school thought leaders, David Ogilvy, Rory Sutherland, Seth Godin. New school thought leaders, we mentioned Nick Sharma. There's a woman named... I'm probably going to butcher her name, Anna Andjelic. She has a newsletter that I didn't mention before. It's called the Sociology of Business. That's really good. She's a CMO, chief brand officer type. She kind of turned around Banana Republic recently, which was cool. Emily Hayward from Red Antler. I also really like Ross. I don't know this guy, but Ross Simmons from Foundation, which is a content marketing agency. I'm not a content marketing expert, but he really is. And I think he puts out some good content.

Lenny (01:20:48):
Man, these show notes are going to be a long list of great stuff. Arielle, thank you so much for being here. There's just so much jampacked knowledge. I don't know if people were prepared when they started listening to this and so congrats on making it through and I hope you're probably going to go back and listen again and again. And so again, Arielle, thank you so much for doing this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or ask questions and how can listeners be useful to you?

Arielle Jackson (01:21:14):
Sure I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. Twitter, I'm hiimarielle. And if you're interested in this stuff, but feeling overwhelmed, I will plug my Maven course. I teach a course on startup brand strategy that covers everything we talked about in this hour, or this is more than an hour now and kind of with a little more hand holding and feedback. So it's a crash course on all this stuff. The four founders that takes two weeks and you go through all of this and that next cohort of that, I think we're on cohort four will be this fall. So you can apply for that course at maven.com/arielle/startupbrandstrategy.

Lenny (01:21:57):
Amazing. And I guess that's how listeners can be useful to you.

Arielle Jackson (01:22:00):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:22:01):
Excellent.

Arielle Jackson (01:22:01):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:22:02):
All right. Well great. All right, well thank you again, thank you again and [inaudible 01:22:07].

Arielle Jackson (01:22:07):
Thanks so much, Lenny. It was fun.

# How 80,000 companies build with AI: Products as organisms and the death of org charts | Asha Sharma

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):
He said that we're just starting to scratch the surface of what an agentic society actually looks like.

Asha Sharma (00:04):
We're approaching this world in which the marginal cost of the good output is approaching zero. We're going to see exponential demand for productivity and outputs. The way that you scale to that is with agents. When all of that happens, the org chart starts to become the work chart. You just don't need as many layers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23):
We were chatting about this concept you have that we're moving from product as artifact to product as organism.

Asha Sharma (00:29):
Because these models are so effective at this point, you want to start to tune them to certain types of outcomes. All of a sudden, these are these living organisms that just get better with the more interactions that happen. I think this is the new IP of every single company products that think and live and learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45):
Planning right now is just crazy. How does anyone plan a roadmap when there's just like, "Okay, GPT-5 is out."

Asha Sharma (00:50):
We think about it as what season are we in? Season one might've been prototyping of AI and then it was all around models and reasoning models, and now it's the advent of agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03):
Today, my guest is Asha Sharma. Asha is Chief Vice President of Product for Microsoft's AI platform where she oversees their AI infrastructure, foundation models and agent tool chains, while also leading applied engineering, responsible AI and growth for the core AI division. She was previously COO at Instacart and VPR product at Meta where she ran Messenger, Instagram Direct, Messenger Kids and Remote Presence. She also sits on the boards of the Home Depot and Coupang, and she's a second degree black belt in Taekwondo.

(01:32):
Asha has a really unique and rare role that allows her to see more than most anyone else in the world, where things are heading with AI and what works and doesn't work for companies that are building large-scale AI products. In our conversation, Asha shares a bunch of trends and predictions that she's seeing that I haven't heard anyone else talk about, why we're moving from a product as artifact to product as organism world, why GUIs are being replaced by code native interfaces, why post-training is the new pre-training, the coming age agentic society, what it takes to be a successful builder today and going forward, and also her single biggest leadership lesson that she learned from Satya who she works closely with.

(03:35):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX, the developer intelligence platform designed by leading researchers. To thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly, but many organization leaders struggle to answer pressing questions like which tools are working, how are they being used? What's actually driving value? DX provides the data and insights that leaders need to navigate this shift.

(03:58):
With DX, companies like Dropbox, Booking.com, Adyen, and Intercom get a deep understanding of how AI is providing value to their developers and what impact AI is having on engineering productivity. To learn more, visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny, that's getdx.com/lenny. Asha, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Asha Sharma (04:25):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:26):
I want to start with something that we were chatting about before this that I've never heard about as a concept that I think is going to be really helpful for people to think about, which is this concept you have that we're moving from product as artifact to product as organism. Talk about what that means and what people need to understand here.

Asha Sharma (04:45):
It's been a pretty interesting shift, especially over the last year or so because when I got to Microsoft, it was right after OpenAI and the large foundation models happened, and then immediately after there was this explosion of models, proprietary open frontier models that were pushing the frontier curve and so they were both more efficient and then we're starting to see domain level expertise in a bunch of them and then even more recently, models now can tool call and they can function call and they can take action, and I think that's just giving way to a new type of products that are starting to see some success.

(05:26):
And so all of a sudden products aren't just like these static artifacts that we start to ship that's not just like, "Hey, come up with an idea or an insight. Go solve a problem, ship it into the world, maybe make it a little bit better and then have a dashboard." All of a sudden, the whole KPI is what is the metabolism of a product team to be able to ingest data and then digest the rewards model and then create some sort of outcome? Because these models are so effective at this point, you want to start tune them to certain types of outcomes, whether it's price or performance or quality. And so it's pretty exciting because all of a sudden these are these living organisms that just get better with the more interactions that happen and in many ways I think this is the new IP of every single company and it's a completely different way to build product and to even think about products that think and live and learn, which is kind of exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:21):
So when I hear this, what I'm thinking about is when I had Michael Truell in the podcast, the Cursor CEO, he talked a lot about how their big moat is the data that they capture from people using Cursor, accepting certain suggestions, not accepting other suggestions. Is that what you're talking about here? Just the proprietary data that companies gather from people using their product or is there something beyond that even?

Asha Sharma (06:40):
I think why we're seeing the rise of post-training happen is just that the models themselves are so powerful. As of this year, Nathan Lambert did this study that I thought was pretty interesting of all the top leader boards and it showed that once a model hits 30 billion parameters, the CapEx to actually train a model and put billions of tokens into a pre-run doesn't economically make sense and you can start to optimize on the loop. And so yeah, in many ways, I think using your own data is the best way to do that, but you can synthetically generate data.

(07:16):
You have to come up with the rewards design, you have to actually roll it out, you have to A/B test it rigorously. You have to find the job to be done or the use case that it makes the most sense for. And then yes, that generates data that you can learn from. I haven't ever seen it be one loop for any product. I think it's multiple tracks running in parallel that are like assembly lines, if you will, and producing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:43):
And so is this thesis that we're moving towards product as organism, is this basically for model companies or is this also true for, I don't know, SaaS businesses and tools and user tools?

Asha Sharma (07:54):
Look, I think that software as a primitive is changing and the artifact inside of it is a model alongside the software components itself. And so in many ways I think that software products will all be model forward products, if you will.

Lenny Rachitsky (08:12):
This reminds me what I just had Nick Turley on the podcast who we were talking about before we started recording head of ChatGPT and I was asking just like how much does ChatGPT change with GPT-5 coming out, and he's just like, "It's the same thing, they're the same product. It's just the model tells us what to do in the product of ChatGPT."

(08:32):
And it makes me think about something else of just you would think why can't just GPT-5 build its own user interface just like as you use it, it just evolve. It's sort of what it's doing with Canvas and all these things, but that's another way I think about when you talk about this idea of product as organism is the product, the UX can shift based on how you're using it and evolve automatically without having product teams have to do anything.

Asha Sharma (08:53):
I 100% believe that's where the world is going, and then my experience should look and feel different than yours. That's been I've been in personalization, but now you can do it on the fly in the future. So I think that'll be a pretty fun world. I also think it will look different for agents and it will look different for power users and new users and all of those things too.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:12):
Let me zoom out a little bit and ask you this question. You work with a bunch of companies that are building AI products on your platform, other platforms. I imagine some just do an awesome job and are killing it, some are struggling. What do you find are common patterns across the companies that do really well and have a lot of success building really successful AI products and ones that don't?

Asha Sharma (09:35):
Yeah, so I think there's things that are more broadly applying to the organization themselves and then there's things that are applying to the people who are building the AI products too. So more broadly, I think there's a pattern that's starting to emerge for successful companies. One is they are embracing AI and everybody becomes AI fluent.

(09:58):
So I think everybody is using some sort of co-pilot or sort of AI in their day-to-day workflows like job one, so everyone's not afraid of it, understands how we can raise the ceiling and lower the floor for all sorts of skills and tasks. Number two, from there, they start to say, "Okay, how can I take a process that already exists and apply AI to making it better?" That might be something like customer support or taking fraud down from 15 days to cure to 10 days.

(10:26):
In going through that entire loop of mapping out the process, applying AI to it, seeing some sort of impact, and then feeling the P&L or the intrinsic benefits that looks like. The third thing then is like, "Okay, great. Now that you've seen impact, everybody is using it, how do you actually use it to inflect growth?" And that can be something like improving the customer experience, so your LTV or retention improves. It could be co-creating a new set of concepts or categories.

(10:56):
It could be going from agents that are embedded to agents that are embodied and then being able to take on exponential number of tasks. I think that where companies fail is that they're doing AI for AI's sake. They have a ton of projects that they're kicking off at the same time without a blueprint to understand how it actually worked and what their Stack looks like and they aren't treating it like a real investment, and so they don't have the measurement and the observability and the evals all set up.

(11:24):
It's going to do that end to end. I think the tricky thing is for enterprises is the technology is changing. There's something like 70,000 enterprise tools in the AI space launched last year. It's really hard to know which one you should use for what outcome. And so you really need to bet on a platform or some app server type layer that allows you to swap things in and out and not really be beholden to anything, any one technology or any one tool because the reality is the whole thing is going to change.

(11:54):
I feel like you have to actually build for the slope instead of the snapshot of where you are. So that's kind of what I see at the enterprise level. I think the builders themselves are actually changing pretty fundamentally too. Every single advent change a technology has invented a changing set of roles like mainframes to PCs like the whole garage engineers, and then when we went from server to cloud and mobile, there was like SEO specialists and CDNs and growth VMs and UXR and front end, back end, and yada yada.

(12:30):
And now I think we're seeing this advent of the polymath and where I think that full stack builders are kind of having their renaissance where if you take an average organization, it takes probably 10 steps to launch a product. It could be security review, it could be spec, it could be user research, and there's what? Five plus functions, maybe six or seven. I'm being generous for a normal organization, and then you have six or seven layers. So all of a sudden, you have 500 different touch points that have to happen to get a product out and when there are 500 models available a week or 500 new technologies, that is insufficient.

(13:15):
And so I really believe in the concept of the full stack builder. You're seeing it with a bunch of the AI native companies that are coming up. I'm even seeing it in enterprises that have been around for 50 years starting to operate in that way. And I think that gives you velocity and throughput and then gives you the whole loop to start to actually metabolize and go through that much faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (13:35):
That's definitely a recurring theme in these conversations is just the Venn diagrams of PM engineering design or starting to converge and more and more of other disciplines within your role. So PM needs to level up on design or engineering.

Asha Sharma (13:50):
Yeah, I completely agree. I think it's all about the loop, not the lane here. And so I think that whatever function you are, you have to be obsessed with trying to understand the efficiency or the cost of the product, the actual rewards or system design that you're going after, the actual UI, UX, how that actually manifests for agents or people. You have to start to get really good at that really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:21):
I like this phrase that you just use, the loop and not the lane. Can you say more about that?

Asha Sharma (14:21):
Oh, it's just going back to our previous discussion on the signals loop and products evolving and becoming these living organisms and not these artifacts. And if you think about getting really good at that loop, I think that is the product, that is the IP, that is the future of every organization and I think feedback becomes continuous and observability becomes the culture, and I think that functions start to blur in future workforces.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:49):
To make this even more real, is there an example of a product or a company that is a really good example of doing this well, living this kind of loop life?

Asha Sharma (14:57):
I think most companies that we're seeing in the space from an AI perspective are doing this. I can tell you about a couple that we are working on. Obviously in the coding space, you mentioned Cursor. GitHub has very similar features that we're using as an ensemble of models that have been fine-tuned across 30 different countries. All of the languages to actually then go iterate in a loop for next set of suggestions or code completions and things like that.

(15:25):
We've got in AI product called Dragon that's for physicians and we saw a massive difference from when we used synthetic fine-tuning to when we annotated 600,000 patient-physician interactions by experts and actually fed that into the model and continuously optimized it to then produce. I think we were sitting between 30 and 60 character acceptance rate depending on the run to something like 83%. And so that required a small group of individuals, not a large organization that were able to actually iterate in this loop across functions and all of those lines dissolving.

Lenny Rachitsky (16:07):
That's super interesting. So what I'm hearing here is if you can gather data on how things are going and then spend a lot of time creating high-quality labeling to feed back into it, to fine-tune it is basically the big advantage is how you win in a lot of this stuff. Okay. Along these lines, something else that you told me that you've been noticing that I want to hear more about is the shift from GUIs and you reference this from GUIs to code-native interfaces. Talk about what that means, what that looks like and what this means for folks building product.

Asha Sharma (16:38):
I think it goes back to what does it mean to be a product maker in the future. I think that everybody's instinct is a GUI, but if you think back in history, databases went from the desktop down into SQL, I think cloud was all about consoles and now it's about Terraform. And so I think we're literally just seeing the same pattern that's played out in history, start to play out in AI and everything else in AI, it's like Moore's law and it's getting faster. And so I think that's just accelerating and if you think about a stream of text just connects better with LLMs.

(17:14):
And so I think that there's a bunch of trends that are working in the favor for the future of products being about composability and not the canvas. And I think that product makers really need to rewire their mindset around this because I think we spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about the UI of something rather than how something composes, how an agent's going to be able to read something. How do you actually get infinite scale? How does that collaboration start to work? And so I think it's just a new way of thinking even though it's long been a trend that's happened in these changes.

Lenny Rachitsky (17:49):
So is the prediction here that it's terminals like Claude code sort of experiences or is it that it's agents that are taking or is it both? Is that what you're just sharing?

Asha Sharma (18:02):
Yeah, look, if any of us knew, that would be amazing. I just think that the reason why terminals are great and it feels really great when you code is because of the way it can interact with an LLM with the text stream. And I think that both can be true that humans will continue to commit code and will find new ways to actually do that, whether it's in the IDE, whether it's in GitHub, Copilot, whether it's in some new development environment, and I think that we'll do that with agents and agents will do that with each other and we'll continue to evolve from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:36):
We had Bret Taylor in the podcast, founder of Sierra, and he had a similar prediction that all software companies are going to become agent companies and it's essentially what you're saying here is that your software will just be this thing that's running in the background and there's much less of a GUI. Do you think it still becomes this chat interface the way we're getting used to? Is that the primary interface with agents or is anything something else happening there?

Asha Sharma (18:58):
I think the conversation is a really powerful interface. I worked on messaging. I think it's great for lots of forms of communication, but it's not the only form of communication. We use email today to collaborate with each other. We use docs. Everybody uses Word and PowerPoint. There's a billion people living in places of artifacts that I think can become really important composable pieces of the picture and I think they should be. So I'm excited about that. I think that chat will be important, but certainly not sufficient.

Lenny Rachitsky (19:35):
What's interesting is ChatGPT, the number one fastest growing product of all time, maybe the most important consequential product of all time is chat.

Asha Sharma (19:44):
Yeah, it's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (19:45):
It works.

Asha Sharma (19:46):
I think the question we have to ask ourselves is will it only always be chat?

Lenny Rachitsky (19:49):
Yeah, yeah. The way Nick described it is we're in the MS-DOS era of ChatGPT, which is interesting. It's like the reverse of what you're saying, so it's like maybe if you start as that and then you have to move to GUI and then maybe it'll go back, but he said there's going to be a Windows version where it's much easier to understand what the hell is going on.

Asha Sharma (20:07):
Yeah. Look, I think that it's smart. Every company should be bringing AI to where their users are and ChatGPT has all of their users using chat and it's a phenomenal product and we've got lots of people around the world that do work in many different ways and we should be thinking about how we use AI to enable that.

Lenny Rachitsky (20:28):
So let's talk about agents. You spent a lot of time working with agents, building agents, helping companies build agents. Yeah. There's a really great quote that I love. You said that we're just starting to scratch the surface of what an agentic society actually looks like. I just love this idea of an agentic society. What does that actually look like in the future?

Asha Sharma (20:47):
Oh gosh. It's funny you were telling me about your two-year-old and I have my son Ron just turned one and I can't even imagine life at two. I'm just like that is so far away and what will have been developed. Look, I think that in the future, work will look really different. I think that we're approaching this world in which the marginal cost of a good output is approaching zero. And I think when that happens, we're going to see exponential demand for productivity and outputs.

(21:20):
And I think that the way that you scale to that is with agents and it's agents that are embedded and their tools and their pieces of software. And I think there's going to be a ton of those far more than the software that we use today. And then I think there could be a set of embodied agents that are developed and we start to see that now, right? You can assign a pull request to Copilot. You can create a software development rep that's agentic that can do some of the lead generation and mining for you.

(21:50):
And so I think that when all of that happens, the work chart starts to become the work chart. I think that tasks and throughput become more important than they have been before. I also think that you just don't need as many layers. I think the whole organizational construct might start to look different in a few years, and so I'm pretty excited about it. I think meetings will still be meetings and there'll be weird, but I think that will be a bit better and I think there'll be lots of changes.

(22:24):
I think that for the average employee, my hope and my optimistic view is that they will be able to expand their skill set because now they have their own agents stack that they can bring with them to work just like you can bring your own device and you can start to have access to a set of skills that you never had before. And so if you think about the 20 million people that maybe sit in that space across America and they get 20% more skilled, it's pretty exponential for GDP, and so it's pretty fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (22:59):
This comment you made about the work chart becomes the org chart is such a profound concept because I don't know if this is what you meant, but what I'm imagining is you build these teams and here's your mission and goal and KPIs and it's humans and like, "Oh cool, go do this first." And what I'm recognizing as you're talking is like, "Okay, but if you have agents doing that, that is their prompt, go drive conversion." And then you have all these agents and that's the org. This is the conversion onboarding team and that's like a bunch of agents off doing their work. Is that what you mean?

Asha Sharma (23:33):
Yeah, I think today we think in terms of, "Hey, who reports to who in the org chart and who's responsible for these areas?" And I think at the end of the day, when you have a set of capable agents and people are capable of more things, you're not going to start to think in hierarchy and communicating up or during start to figure out outward task base type of opportunities. I think that humans will always decide in organizations how AI is used and what we want to apply it to.

(23:58):
But yeah, it's exciting when a new issue comes up or new tasks comes up, how do you actually automatically decide where to route it? Who's working on that task? How do you actually go work on it? How do you observe if they, it's doing the right thing, how do you fine-tune it if they're not, all of those things. So I think that I'm just speculating that there's a world in which that could be pretty exciting and I think that's great because we can just accomplish more.

Lenny Rachitsky (24:25):
You touch on this point that reviewing the work is going to be increasingly important. If you have a thousand agents off doing work, it's just like holy moly, that's a lot to look at and make sure they're doing the right thing. How do you think that evolves? Just being able to scale your ability to review the work that's being done?

Asha Sharma (24:40):
Yeah, I think that the same kind of loop that we talked about becomes increasingly important, like fine-tuning and self-healing observability, really good evals, all of that. The good news is that there are systems that manage this for billions of people today that already exists, and so I think that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. There's certainly going to be a bunch of new things to learn if that world ever plays out, but I think managing devices and policies and group access, all those things are solved problems, which is good.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:17):
This episode is brought to you by Fin, the number one AI agent for customer service. If your customer support tickets are piling up, then you need Fin. Fin is the highest performing AI agent on the market with a 59% average resolution rate. Fin resolves even the most complex customer queries. No other AI agent performs better. In head head bake offs with competitors, Fin wins every time.

(25:39):
Yes, switching to a new tool can be scary, but Fin works on any help desk with no migration needed, which means you don't have to overhaul your current system or deal with delays in service for your customers. And Fin is trusted by over 5,000 customer service leaders and top AI companies like Anthropic and Synthesia. And because Fin is powered by the Fin AI engine, which is a continuously improving system that allows you to analyze, train, test, and deploy with ease, Fin can continuously improve your results too.

(26:07):
So if you're ready to transform your customer service and scale your support, give Fin a try for only 99 cents per resolution. Plus, Fin comes with a 90-day money back guarantee. Find out how Fin can work for your team at fin.ai/lenny, that's fin.ai/lenny. So a lot of this, it feels like it's in the future. I know a lot of this already happening, people are using agents in all these different ways. Is there any way you and your team have found a value in working with agents of some kind other than coding I imagine is a big part of it, but just anything there that's like, "Wow, that's a big deal."

Asha Sharma (26:40):
At this point, we have AI and agents and many of our workflows, one of my favorite ones, so right now are my engineering partners out. So I jump on the live site bridges when something goes down and as something as simple as you can automatically get a summary of everything that just happened because usually, there's 15 people talking, you don't actually know where the incident started, where it's going to end and everything and then all of a sudden I have that and I can figure out and ask questions and get updates. Awesome. I think that the entire DevOps areas is changing.

(27:17):
We use use Spark to create prototypes so everybody on the team is expected to code, but sometimes just chatting in and talking in real words actually gets you to a prototype that's more interesting and more expressive and reflective of your creativity. So we use that. I think everybody's using AI to write. Everybody is using AI to find ways to have efficiencies and coming up with documentation and things like that, and so I think it's everywhere, which is cool. I think that we're just scratching the surface though for what's possible in terms of working with agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (27:58):
That's how I always feel when people ask me how I use AI. It's just like everywhere. It's just in every little sprinkled in everything I do now. I don't even know how to describe it.

Asha Sharma (28:06):
Yeah, it's hard to remember a world where it didn't really exist.

Lenny Rachitsky (28:09):
Yeah, there's a product manager that I collab with, Peter Yang who talks about how he just, "I don't even know how to do a strategy doc anymore without AI. How did people do this without having someone-"

Asha Sharma (28:20):
Do you think there will be strategy docs in the future? That's going to be interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (28:25):
I wrote this post once of which skills of a PM job will be most replaced by AI, and strategy is the one that people are the most have the biggest debate on. You could argue, I don't know, let's get into it briefly. You would think if some AI had all of the information you had about where the market is going, your metrics, your product today, it would be so good at developing a strategy for you. Many people think that's the one thing AI will be really not good at for a long time because that's where we need all this human judgment stuff. I don't know, do you have any thoughts?

Asha Sharma (28:59):
I think that some of the most consequential products in the world required a bunch of deterministic, logical sets of inputs and sparks of creativity and imagination and judgment and vision that could not be achieved without humans. Microsoft is the vision of a software factory and creating what Microsoft did wasn't inevitable. Instacart, there was web bands and web bands didn't work, but Instacart did work because of a different way of thinking about it.

(29:40):
That came through and iteration and a bunch of things that you couldn't have learned unless you actually went through the process, the iPod, you go forward. So I think it's there. I think docs themselves for every idea, for every need will just start to fade into applications and different artifacts in the productivity suite, which is just a different way of working.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:06):
Yeah. Your original question, which I didn't quite answer, but I think is important. You're asking do we even need strategy docs? And I guess it's just somehow everyone needs to be aligned on the strategy, maybe it's not a doc.

Asha Sharma (30:17):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:17):
Yeah, it could be some other artifact.

Asha Sharma (30:20):
If you architect an organization the right way to keep up with AI, you need a different alignment mechanisms than traditional ways of actually work.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:34):
So let me ask you actually about that. So planning right now is just crazy. How does anyone plan a roadmap when there's just like, "Okay, GPT-5 is out." Okay, great. What works for you for setting actual a roadmap and a strategy for your team? How far out do you plan? How often do you have to rethink everything?

Asha Sharma (30:49):
I'll caveat this by saying everyone's just figuring it out and it's a lot harder to figure it out when you're a larger organization than when you're much smaller and you get to run something yourself and there's pros and cons to both. So here's what we do. The company historically, at least in our product teams had semesters that they planned against.

(31:10):
So think of that as every six months there's a strategy to look back, look forward, all of those things. I think that's very valuable. I think the idea of six months though and really understanding what's changing out in front is truly challenging to have a overbaked situation. And so we think about it as what season are we in? And so a season which is very uncomfortable can be denoted by a set of secular changes that are happening in the industry or that are happening from customers.

(31:40):
And so you can think about season one might've been the prototyping of AI and the early GPT work and then it was all around models and reasoning models and now it's the advent of agents and so that can last a year, that can last six months, that can last three months. But grounding everybody on the ethos of what are the secular changes? What are the customer problems we need to solve? What does winning look like?

(32:06):
So everybody has that shared sense. What is the north star metric is something that we do. The second thing that we do is that we have kind of loose quarterly OKR. So like, "Okay, if we believe that, what do we need to do next quarter to actually put ourselves on a path to that?" And then from there, teams are operating in squads and they're kind of setting out four to six week goals that they're trying to go after for problem areas to go ladder up to that and especially as the platform for the company and the platform for our Azure customers with AI, I'll say we go through lots of changes to that all the time and I think we have to just have an openness that that is the business that we're in.

(32:47):
I think the other thing is just we try to leave Slack in the system, not just for the unplanned, but for the slope. I think that we have to continuously be thinking about how we're going to disrupt the platform in our thinking and what we need to be investing in to make that possible. And so we try to do a little bit of both.

Lenny Rachitsky (33:06):
This is awesome. So what I'm hearing here is there's this concept of seasons and everyone's aligned, "Okay, this is time for agents, this is what's happening right now. We're going to center around our strategy around agents." And then there's these loose quarterly OKRs. You plan for three months roughly and then you leave some Slack in the system for things to change.

Asha Sharma (33:24):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (33:24):
Is the current season agents, how would you describe what season we're in right now?

Asha Sharma (33:27):
Yeah, it's agents. The rise of agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (33:31):
The rise of agents. It sounds like a Terminator movie. Do you have a sense of what the next season might be? Is there any like, "Oh, this might be coming next."

Asha Sharma (33:39):
Gosh, I don't, but I think that, look, we have more than 15,000 agents that are deployed on our service today, at least at the Azure service. There's a bunch of other platforms in the company and I would just say that I think that we should really focus on making sure that we have all of the alignment, accountability, observability, evals to making those agents great.

(34:11):
I think that Manus breakthrough in the space was that they could do these tool calling loops and have agents do longer running tasks that really no other platform was able to do. I think stuff like that is critical. Memory is critical. There's still a bunch of building blocks that I think are leaving agents incomplete in the wild that I think we have to really sweat the details on before we move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:37):
So it's just like agents until the end of time until super intelligence and then we're just on beaches chilling.

Asha Sharma (34:44):
Yes, agents until dank memes look. Yeah, I think the cool thing is something new could come in three months. Something new could come in 13 months. I think we have this conviction on a set of building blocks that we want to provide to enable these agents to endure and have high endurance and so that's what we're focused on.

Lenny Rachitsky (35:07):
When you said there's 15,000 agents, what does that mean? Is that 15,000 types of agents you can use or is it like that's how many processes are?

Asha Sharma (35:13):
No, that's customers. 15,000 I think I should re-reference the numbers. 15,000 customers who have produced agents. I think the number of agents is actually millions.

Lenny Rachitsky (35:24):
15,000 customers that are building a specific kind of agent on your platform and they're running and the number of agents is in the millions just running in the cloud.

Asha Sharma (35:32):
Yes. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (35:33):
Okay. It's wild. Some crazy numbers here. Okay, so let me just go in a slightly different direction. You're in the center of the storm of a lot of AI, just seeing everything else going on. Is there something you wish you'd known before stepping into this role that you're just like, "Okay, I see. I didn't expect this."

Asha Sharma (35:52):
When I first took the role, it was described as the belly of the beast and I had spent most of my career building products at the center of machine learning and applications or businesses and I think that to my surprise, a lot of the learnings have translated in terms of what makes a great platform is what makes a great product. And the thing for me is it's often in the invisible work or not the pixels that actually drives that.

(36:26):
So for example, one of the first companies that I worked at was a company called Porch Group. I was employee seven and we knew we wanted to help people take care of their home and I think we invented so many features like the home report or a way to manage your home or house style inspiration where you could see all of the houses and it's map every single room. And the single most important thing that we could have done and did during my time there was create a matching platform that matched the 6 million professionals with the 1,300 service types with the 37,000 zip codes and all of the homeowners in North America to actually take care of their home, and that was just the game of inches and optimizing that engine in order to create higher quality leads essentially.

(37:15):
That's what got us to the first $500 million valuation. That's eventually what we built on to actually have other vertical services and software platforms that IP of the company. Same with messaging. The number one learning that I had was look like WhatsApp didn't win because it had stickers or stories or dark mode. In fact, I don't even think it had all of those things when it won. It won on a few premises because one was the phone book, you knew that when you use WhatsApp, you could reach every single person because you had their phone number and those are the people that you care about when you're using messaging.

(37:54):
It was the reliability and how fast it was. I could text my grandmother in India and know that she would get my text message all the time, and then it was the privacy. When you are sending 200 messages a day to the four people you care about most, you want to make sure no one else can read the messages and so the end-to-end encryption really mattered. And so it wasn't the hundreds of features, it was all in the infrastructure and the platform.

(38:21):
Same Instacart, there are so many loved features of Instacart, but at the end of the day, it's a billion items that updates 3,000 times every single minute to get homeowners their groceries from the store that they love. And so I think I wish I had known that because I think it would've curtailed my learning curve to say that it's not all the features for the platform that matters, it's the data residency.

(38:46):
So the hospital in Germany that's fine-tuning the model can do so in confidence and the data isn't going to leave the region, it's the availability, it's the reliability. It's making sure you have the right selection of the tools that enterprises need and the right way to retrieve the knowledge and that's the platform that we've built but just didn't fully have that picture that those learnings would translate.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:07):
Mm-hmm. That's really interesting. So what I'm hearing is people undervalue who just the simple bottom of the Maslow hierarchy of things that help you win in platforms, especially in messaging platforms including so it's like reliability, privacy, I don't know, availability.

Asha Sharma (39:26):
Yeah, performance, reliability, privacy, safety, all of those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:31):
Mm-hmm. Let me ask you a totally different question. When we were going to record this previously and you're like, "Oh, I have a big meeting with Satya I got to do instead." And so we moved at a different time. Very few people get to work with Satya, he's quite a successful leader. What's something you've learned from him about? I don't know, leadership or product building?

Asha Sharma (39:52):
I've learned that optimism is a renewable resource. This company for 50 years has had every reason not to succeed and it has even as it's had early success in the AI era and challenges and other successes and the space is developing so quickly, I think that his ability to generate energy and to use his optimism to renew everybody's dedication to the mission is unbelievable and I think it's such an important part of the culture. Everybody talks about the growth mindset, that's real, huge part of the culture, but I think the ability to generate energy and clarity on what we need to go do and use optimism to renew the commitment every single day for every single person in an entirely competitive talent space is pretty amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:54):
Is that something you think that is just innate to him or it's something that he's worked on to just generate this optimism on behalf of everyone?

Asha Sharma (40:59):
I have no idea. We should ask him, but I'm deeply impressed by it.

Lenny Rachitsky (41:04):
It's interesting that a lot of this comes down to just vibes. There's just this vibe of imagine it's not him just the words he uses, it's just this energy that he exudes optimism and energy.

Asha Sharma (41:16):
Think about it. We all choose to someone who just said this to me and I thought it was great, "We all choose to close the door on our kids every single day to go work on something." And so you have to work on something that is deeply moving to you and you have a deep belief that is going to make the world a better place and I think that's why it's vibes. I think you have to follow and have a sense of duty towards a mission that is bigger than yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (41:45):
It makes me think of a line that I've referenced a couple of times on this podcast that hits people really hard that the only people that'll remember you working late are your kids.

Asha Sharma (41:54):
Okay. I don't know where we're going with that, but that was like, now you're like, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:02):
It's too much. We've gone too far. Oh man. Okay. Well let ask you this. What's driving you?

Asha Sharma (42:04):
We could have said our customers, we could have gone a different route on that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:09):
This is the real stuff. What's driving you? What's driving you? What's keeping you excited about the work that you're doing?

Asha Sharma (42:17):
What AI will help us do from a workforce perspective, what it will help us do from a healthcare perspective. My mom has cancer and I think a lot about how we might find a way to solve the form of cancer she has in my lifetime and I never thought that was possible three years ago. All of that's deeply profound and the thing that I personally think a lot about now that we know that we're living in this time working with such powerful technology is the effects of it and how I can best build a platform where people can make use of it.

(42:52):
So the reason why I work at Microsoft is because the whole ethos of the company is how do I help people and businesses achieve more and more for me in the thing I think about at night outside of GPUs is I think about will my son have classmates in the future? And that's not because agents are going to replace them, it's because the fertility rates are declining. The average birth rate in the '90s when we were growing up was like three and now it's 2.3 and in 2050, it's estimated to be below replacement and I think that AI can have such a big effect on it and already is.

(43:42):
It was just reading about a hospital in London that's able to improve pregnancy rates by using AI to match eggs and sperms and their cutting costs at the same time. You saw with the ChatGPT-5 launch yesterday. Such an amazing story about how ChatGPT is helping in healthcare. Stanford is one of our big customers with the platform that I build and they're working on using AI for tumor reviews and it's just like, it is these sets of things that will move humanity forward and expand our lifetime and give us the privilege to solve 100-year problems. And so that's why I'm excited and that's why I do what I do.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:22):
Yeah, especially in your role where you're building the platform that enables all of this, I could see how impactful that could be. Asha, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or share or double down on of anything we've talked about before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Asha Sharma (44:39):
We touched on it a little bit, but I think that with the advent of agents and products that think and can act and reason, there's going to be this new wave around RL and I have a deep belief that that will become one of the most important product techniques of the next season or at least the next few seasons.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:00):
And RL is reinforcement learning?

Asha Sharma (45:02):
Yes. Yes, exactly. I believe we will see just as much money spent on post-training as we will on pre-training and in the future, more on post-training. We talked a little bit about Nathan Lambert's study where his review was that when a model hits 30 billion parameters, it makes more sense to fine-tune and optimize that 50% of developers according to surveys are now fine-tuning and we know fine-tuning is good, but if you actually go through the full loop, you can get better results.

(45:30):
So I think there's a bunch there and I think there's a whole new set of infrastructure and platforms and companies that will be created that are all around this part of the stack. And so I think it's an exciting time to be in the platform space, but it's also an exciting time to be starting companies and be thinking about those problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:48):
I want to make sure people truly understand what you're saying here because not everyone truly understands post-training, pre-training. What's the simplest way to understand the difference there and just why it's such a big deal that investment is moving to post-training?

Asha Sharma (46:02):
The way that I think about it is to create a foundation model, it requires a tremendous amount of compute, a tremendous amount of science. Expertise as we're seeing which the cost for scientists or the average value is raising dramatically and I think an expertise that we've seen isn't everywhere in the world right now. And so it's just a big CapEx investment to do that.

(46:33):
With this explosion of models that we talked about in the beginning, there's a lot of good models to choose from for different domains. And so I think that you just get more leverage economically, you get more leverage from a taste perspective of how you actually want to steer a model if you're actually doing reinforcement learning or some sort of fine-tuning to actually start to optimize what's off the shelf for some outcome like price, performance, quality.

(46:58):
If you think about that, that's not crazy, right? Ranking is an age-old optimization problem where you don't want to just take what's off the shelf because there's amazing frameworks and UI and components that the world is react components that are out there. You still want to tailor the experience to a set of use cases or a set of people. I think it's just the same industrial logic.

Lenny Rachitsky (47:22):
So in practice, what this means is there's a GPT-5 model. You're saying there's a lot of opportunity and a much more efficient way to spend money, which is take something like that and then train that on additional custom data that you have, whether it's data or just reinforcement learning, maybe even with humans to align it with what you wanted to achieve?

Asha Sharma (47:41):
Yep, and it could be your own data, it could be data that you buy, it could be synthetic data, it could be something else, but I think that we're going to start to see more and more companies and organizations start to think about how do I adapt a model rather than how do I take something off the shelf as is or invest a bunch of money and building my own models.

Lenny Rachitsky (48:06):
Yeah, I forget. I know Cursor, when he was on the podcast, he shared that they have a bunch of models that support your experience with Cursor and over time, they're just going to have their own thing. I forget who it was, Windsor for one of those guys just uses their own model now, they don't just plug into Claude.

Asha Sharma (48:22):
I'm much more in the model system camp. I believe in model diversity. I think that in experience like Claude, like Sonnet 4 is awesome for a set of use cases versus GPT-5 is different for different use cases. I think that there's some tasks where you care about the latency of the model. You're cool with the thinking time or you want a quick retrieval and things like that. I think the beauty is there's a lot of models that can help you achieve that, and so I'm much more in the model system rather than one model to rule them all.

Lenny Rachitsky (48:58):
Is that the right term? I've also heard ensemble model, ensemble of models.

Asha Sharma (49:01):
I think about an ensemble of models as a set of multiple models that then you can fine-tune and deploy independently, but at this point, we're all making up different terminology to define things that we have deep beliefs on that have limited sets of data points because everything is moving so fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (49:18):
Yeah. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Asha Sharma (49:23):
I'm very excited for our lightning round and I'm turning down the lights

Lenny Rachitsky (49:27):
And then it'll come back on I imagine in one second. Okay. First question, what are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Asha Sharma (49:34):
At work? It's probably Thinking Machines, so it's all about treating the cause, not the symptoms. The prototypical example is if you want to solve traffic, you don't actually put up speed bumps or speed limits, you actually have to solve walkability and mobility and why people actually use cars. Outside of that, personally, the CMO of Instacart recommended to me Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow and I read it last month and last year and the year before because I love it so much. It's like this beautiful story over 10 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (50:12):
Mm-hmm. What are some favorite recent movie or TV shows you really enjoyed?

Asha Sharma (50:18):
Formula One, saw it twice for all mankind. For all Mankind, I like season four. I don't know, I like playing alternative theories to how the space race might have looked.

Lenny Rachitsky (50:32):
Do you have a favorite product? That you recently discovered that you really love? Could be tech, could be gadgets, could be clothing.

Asha Sharma (50:36):
So I just joined the board of the Home Depot and we're doing a little renovation project and so there's this new, well, new to me DEWALT power pack and they use pouch cells and so it's like 50% lighter, but with all the power and it's awesome for drills and things that I need to lift up with one hand that feel heavy. So I love that.

(50:59):
We also are testing out this new brilliant, smart home kind of system. So it's four inches of high-res middleware that allows you to connect to everything and I've reached peak dissat with the explosion of all the technology required to actually use your home. So it just might be the middleware that sticks, but we'll see.

Lenny Rachitsky (51:22):
Did you say dissat? Is that short for dissatisfaction?

Asha Sharma (51:26):
Yes. Sorry. I'm speaking in acronyms.

Lenny Rachitsky (51:28):
Whoa, I've never heard that dissat. I love that. By the way, I love that you're on the board of the Home Depot. What a different part of the spectrum of work.

Asha Sharma (51:40):
Yeah, it's been awesome. The very first board meeting, the head of philanthropy has been at the company for decades and she said, "Welcome to the greatest company on the planet." It's pretty special.

Lenny Rachitsky (51:52):
They're like, "Microsoft." Is there something you've learned from working with them that you've brought to Microsoft?

Asha Sharma (52:00):
Look, it's new, it's this year, but I've long worked on products that had that impact. So when I was at Porch, it was pros. At Instacart, we had 600,000 shoppers and obviously, the Home Depot has associates. One of my favorite things about the company culturally is they have this inverted pyramid where instead of having executives at the top, the associates are at the top and the stores themselves are headquarters and then the traditional HQ is support.

(52:35):
And so it's so customer-centric and when I think about amazing execution and creating these durable long-term institutions and how culture and ideology and leadership is formed, I think about that and I think about at the end of the day, AI is going to have an impact on every single person and every single job. And it's amazing to just spend time with people outside of our bubble and really try and learn what their real pain and problems and how they think about AI and how they think about technology and what we need to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (53:09):
Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to? Sharing with friends or family?

Asha Sharma (53:18):
I used to use the minimize regret framework and it's great, and I've used that for a long time. I think that probably once I got into my adult years and started to have a family and things like that, my just worldview changed a little bit and it was all about maximizing option value and it just gave the things that I naturally cared about like family and health and trust and relationships.

(53:51):
It was just a new level of value associated with those because all of a sudden, learning rest on the weekend can compound in the future or having good health can compound in the future. You don't have to trade that off of working extra hours or the importance of family and all of those things. And so I think that my worldview is when I'm 70, it's not about what do I look back on in my life and count the number of regrets, it's really about looking forward in the number of adventures I will still have because I have accumulated this wealth of skills and trust and people and family and impact and things like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (54:31):
Speaking of skills, the internet tells me that you're a second degree black belt in Taekwondo. Why? Oh gosh. Is this true? And then I have a question about it.

Asha Sharma (54:44):
This is true.

Lenny Rachitsky (54:45):
Okay. That's incredible. Why is this embarrassing? That's an incredible thing.

Asha Sharma (54:52):
I am generally embarrassed anytime anything is discussed about me.

Lenny Rachitsky (54:56):
Okay, great. No problem. What's something that you learned from Taekwondo that has helped you with life or work?

Asha Sharma (55:03):
Taekwondo is more mental than it is physical. And so I think that's the same with all of our jobs and making product. I think it's like mental clarity, it's courage. It's the ambition to see things through and be unwavering. And so I think that's literally what it taught me outside of meditating, which probably took me the entire time to actually learn to meditate and clear my head. But yeah, I think it's awesome. I think everybody imagines flying psychics or running up a wall and you can do those things too, but the real value is the mental pursuit of it all.

Lenny Rachitsky (55:47):
And you can do those things too. Wow. Okay. I'm good. I got to get into this. Asha, this was awesome. Is there, oh, actually two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to maybe follow up on anything, if you want people to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Asha Sharma (56:02):
You can hit me up on LinkedIn or email or text. I think all of those are traceable. Look, how can you be helpful to me? I think we're all early in this journey and great platforms that are built on great use cases and built on great customers, and so if you have feedback, you have ideas, you have things want AI to be able to do to help you achieve more, I'd love to hear it. I think the thing about all of these changes is that all of these new products and use cases will be developed everywhere, and so I'm always just thinking about how can we be the platform to support that.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:40):
Amazing. Asha, thank you so much for being here.

## Transcript

Ayo Omojola (00:00):
Cash App, as a team we really cared about what we could do that was different and better than what else existed in-market. Being different is not enough, because it's very easy to build a thing that's different from what exists today, because you just have to look at what exists today and build something else. Being better is not enough, because it's also easy to say, "Hey, I'm going to make this thing better, and just charge you more money for it." It has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user, and for us for a long time it was when someone says, "Hey, why are you betting on Venmo?" I'd be like, "Try and send me a dollar that I can use now," and there was only one app you could do it with.

Lenny (00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ayo Omojola, Ayo co-created and scaled Square's popular Cash Card, alongside the hugely popular Cash App. He's currently chief product officer at Carbon Health, one of the biggest and fastest-growing health tech companies in the world. He's a former founder, he's on the board of Pinwheel, and he's an angel investor in companies like Mercury Bank, Fair, Modern Treasury, and dozens of other startups. In today's episode, we dig into lessons from building and scaling the Cash Card and the Cash App, the importance of differentiation when you're building a consumer product or any sort of product.

(01:17):
How to successfully build a startup within a startup, how to succeed in both fintech and in health tech, plus my favorite part of the conversation, a handful of incredibly insightful and practical principles and philosophies around hiring, team-building, leadership, and going deep on problems. Ayo is such a fascinating human and leader, and I am excited for you to learn from him. With that, I bring you Ayo Omojola, after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Microsoft Clarity, a free, easy-to-use tool that captures how real people are actually using your site. You can watch life session replays to discover where users are breezing through your flow and where they struggle, you can view instant heat maps to see what parts of your page users are engaging with and what content they're ignoring.

(02:01):
You can also pinpoint what's bothering your users with really cool frustration metrics, like rage clicks, and dead clicks, and much more. If you listen to this podcast, you know how often we talk about the importance of knowing your users, and by seeing how users truly experience your product you can identify product opportunities, version wins, and find big gaps between how you imagine people using your product, and how they actually use it. Microsoft Clarity makes it all possible with a simple, yet incredibly powerful set of features. You'll be blown away by how easy Clarity is to use, and it's completely free forever. You will never run into traffic limits, or be forced to upgrade to a paid version. It also works across both apps and websites. Stop guessing, get Clarity.

(02:45):
Check out Clarity at clarity.microsoft.com. This episode is brought to you by ECO. Last month, ECO users earned an average of $84 in cashback rewards. How? With ECO, the future of personal finance. ECO is the update to a misaligned financial system, providing an app that works just like your bank, but removes almost all of the middle men, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time, automatically. What if you earned rewards for paying your rent, or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online? Or even earned rewards for saving each month. And then imagine if you got rewarded again, just for getting rewarded. With ECO, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cashback.

(03:30):
Plus, ECO's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are ECO Points, the world's first open reward system. You earn them whenever you do almost anything in the ECO app. ECO is working to make these points the most rewarding points ever, so it pays to be early. Sound too good to be true? Go to eco.com/lenny, sign up for an onboarding, and find out why it isn't. Lenny's Podcast listeners who attend an ECO welcome session will get an exclusive 4% APY on deposits over $1,000. Learn more at eco.com/lenny, that's E-C-O.com/lenny. Ayo, welcome to the podcast.

Ayo Omojola (04:12):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny (04:13):
I have a feeling this is going to be a really fun conversation, I was doing a little research on you ahead of this chat and I found this interesting thing that you did in the past, where I found you answered over 100 questions on Quora about people trying to ship stuff and mail stuff, and I have no idea what's going on there. And so, tell us what is going on there.

Ayo Omojola (04:32):
In 2015 I'd been at Cash App for about a year, had massive burnout from the last company, went through IC, kind of like did a hard pivot, imploded a little bit, stuff kind of picked up, sold the company eventually. And my brother, who's my co-founder, and I had this idea, and I think it was actually from printing and mailing my section 83B for something that I'd done. And I was like, "Why can't I just go onto the internet and do this?" And so I had this idea to build an application where you could give it a document and an address, and we would print it and mail it for you. And it was right around when Lob was founded, which was...

(05:13):
Lob is like this printing and mailing API. So we built this thing called Mailform, I think it's like one of the top consumer print and mail things on the internet. I'm sure many people who listen to this will have used it for... And then we had to figure out how to grow it, and the way that I actually learned how to do SEO was running around the internet, trying to find ways to tell people that we did this, and that they would find us. And we actually ended up, funny as it turns out, we ended up building a whole sort of SEO content infrastructure around it that has really impacted my thinking. But all the answers on Quora were me just trying to get people... You know, if you remember like 2014, Quora was like this massive thing.

(06:00):
So all the answers on Quora were me trying to get people who might be thinking about the problem that we were solving to realize that we exist.

Lenny (06:06):
That was my guess, it was going to be either user research on the space of shipping and mailing things, or it was a growth tactic, and it clearly is the second. You're saying this product still exists, that some people can still use?

Ayo Omojola (06:17):
Yeah, yeah, it exists, a lot of people use it. We have maybe customers that you've heard of and use. I won't say their names, because I don't know if they want me to do that. But you know, I would say there are a couple of large delivery tech companies that use us to mail 1099s, W2 forms, what have you.

Lenny (06:39):
Holy moley, okay. And this is just a side project of yours?

Ayo Omojola (06:42):
Yeah, one of many.

Lenny (06:43):
Amazing. Let's talk about your Cash App experience, which I imagine was a pretty transformative period in your career. And from my understanding it had a major impact on the success of the app and the business that was built there. To give folks a bit of scale and understanding of just the Cash App in general, can you just briefly talk about how big was it when you joined, like the scale of the app, and then whatever you can share about just the scale today.

Ayo Omojola (07:08):
When I joined Cash App was probably sub 50K actives, like people moving money. Today I think it's north of 50 million actives on a monthly basis, will all different types of money movement, like Bitcoin, PP, card, stocks. And I think it's something like north of 70 or 80 million actives on an annual basis.

Lenny (07:35):
Wow, okay, great. What I want to talk a bit about is that Cash App to me is a rare example of a huge consumer app success story, I've been angel investing for a while now and I've just learned how rare consumer apps work. Like, they never work, and this one worked. Even within a big company, you think that there's a huge chance of something working if they have the support of a big company, and the platform, things like that. Still, they almost all fail. And so what I'm curious about is, what do you think you all did most right, one to launch it successfully in the consumer space, and then two, to keep it growing and scaling to where it got today?

Ayo Omojola (08:13):
My perspective is that, and I think this is a, people don't like this kind of answer.

Lenny (08:22):
I'm exciting to hear this.

Ayo Omojola (08:23):
But the thing Cash App did right was like 10 things, not one. There were like 10 things that actually best in class, like insane talent density, insane focus, very strong at fraud, a lot of the way Brian, and Dustin, and Jesse, and Dangi tried to organize the amount... Like you know, with Jack's support was just really firewalled from the rest of the square, the hero customer was the consumer, not the merchants, so it was like literally in 100% of the trade offs the consumer's needs came first. And that's a very, very hard thing to do, instead of accommodating like... It made people angry, actually. Really insane focus on design, incredible depth in... This is the thing that I think you will appreciate, but it's very hard to appreciate just as a consumer of things, people would be like, "Hey, what's the difference between you and Venmo?"

(09:26):
And the only reason you would ask that is if you just hadn't thought about it for a second. Now, today there's like a lot of convergence on features like... So Venmo's sort of caught up on a lot of the things. But at the time, Venmo didn't have push to debit, Venmo didn't have an instant. For like three or four years in the United States, the fastest and lowest-cost way to move money in the country between any two people who had bank accounts was Cash App. And I think that kind of changed in 2017, when PayPal, Venmo, Apple Cash, et cetera, kind of came out and launched all their things. And so I think actually it's possible that having done only one of those things well, Cash App might have been successful. But I think the reason it's differentially successful in the market today is the compound effect of all those things.

Lenny (10:12):
What are some of the lasting lessons that you take to other consumer apps that you're... Like Carbon Health, for example? Or founders that you work with, because all those things are amazing, hard to replicate sometimes. Is there stuff you extract from them, like, "Here's something that I'm going to do any time I'm building a consumer app"? Is it like the design-related component, is there anything else along those lines?

Ayo Omojola (10:33):
This is the thing I struggle with, I saw on Twitter somebody say this comment, that a lot of times when people describe their success to you what they're really saying is like, "This is my lottery ticket number." So to be honest, before I go down this diatribe I don't actually know which of the things are replicable. I just know kind of what I believe to be true, and I'm trying... Some of it worked, some of it not, et cetera. So I think Cash App, as a team we really cared about what we could do that was different and better than what else existed in market. And for us, for a long time it was instant, and if you look at all the products you'll see this sort of theme, of when you cash out there's an instant option.

(11:20):
When you get a cash card, we issue your card to you instantly. When you sell stocks, money's available instantly. When you sell Bitcoin, money's available instantly. Like literally, there's no like, "Oh, circle, circle, circle processing," it's like, "Available to spend." And I think there's something actually lasting about the concept of instant, because there still in the world today are like lots of businesses and processes that are like asynchronous, but not for any reason other than, that's just the way the world is. So I think that's like one thing that's kind of narrow. And then I would say another thing that I think is really broad is just being really crisp about why what you're doing is different and better than what exists today. And it's like, being different is not enough, because it's very easy to build a thing that's different form what exists today, because you just have to look at what exists today and build something else.

(12:08):
And being better is not enough, because it's also easy to say, "Hey, I'm going to make this thing better and just charge you more money for it." And so I think there's like, different... You optimize for doing a thing that's different, it has to be better than what exists today, and it has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user, or to the buyer, depending on what your market is. And then after all that, it also... You have to be in a domain that matters, because it's very easy to get those three right, to build like a really... How do I say this? A thing that's different and better than what exists today, in a way that matters to end users could also just be art. Which is just like, art is a complex thing to scale.

(12:58):
And so you have to like, then also get the economics right, get the entire pipeline of like how you ship, how you build, how you talk about it, all that stuff has to work as well.

Lenny (13:08):
I think there's some really great lessons there, just to kind of mirror back what you're saying. Just differentiation in this case ends up being really important, and if you're trying to disrupt someone doing something, like say Venmo. Like, you can't just be a better Venmo, you have to be different. And it sounds like instant was the differentiator in this case.

Ayo Omojola (13:25):
For a long time, yeah, yeah. Or rather, it was the cut through the clutter differentiator. There were actually like a lot of other sort of long tail of things that we were doing those different, but it was like, instant was the thing where when someone says, "Hey, why are you betting on Venmo?" I'd be like, "Try and send me a dollar that I can use now," and there was only one app you could do it with.

Lenny (13:46):
And I think the other element of this, it connects to something I'm working on in the newsletter, is when you're trying to find a big idea, especially in B2B, but in this case it worked in B2C, is just, it needs to be important, it needs to matter, like it can't be a better thing that nobody values highly, because then you will make money in B2B, and in B2C people won't even use it. So, these are really great. You mentioned in passing when we were preparing for this that Block was trying to kill the Cash App for a lot of time, early time.

Ayo Omojola (14:16):
I wouldn't say like Block was trying to kill the Cash App. I think that there were many, many people who worked there that absolutely... And I mean this in the nicest way, identities were tied with Square being a merchant business, believed that the investment in Cash App could have been better deployed elsewhere, didn't want to work on consumer. There was just like a myriad of... And then look, I'm sure people who were there [inaudible 00:14:44], like we probably also made mistakes, and didn't communicate well, and didn't sell it well, and so on. But there was a crazy amount of friction, I'll put it that way. A thing I will 100% give Brian credit for is, he was really effective at making sure that we had a shot.

Lenny (15:04):
Zooming out for a moment and thinking about just Square and Block, and how they operate as a product company and as a business, is there anything that you've taken away from that experience that you bring with you to where you are now? Which, I want to talk about next.

Ayo Omojola (15:16):
I don't know necessarily if this was intentional, my guess is it was probably just like a consequence of Square going through, going public and trying to be sort of a rigorous financial institution. I think when you are in a large organization, trying to do a actually new thing, I think small teams are better than big ones, period. And forcing the teams to be like super, sort of thoughtful about hitting milestones and actually adding value, because there's this thing people say about like, "Hey, the startup within a startup, everything's fake." And the reason I think it's fake is because when you're a startup you actually worry about paying the people who work for you, and when you aren't inside of a company you just don't.

(16:02):
And there is just a difference between having that existential fear of, "Are we going to be here tomorrow, and not?" So I think a consequence of not having that existential fear is that it's easy to just be like, "Hey, I need more resources," and the organization has some habits around how you acquire resources, and if the leadership of the... If the leadership building the new thing happened to be good at that, you can have growth in a new project's people size that doesn't match the new project's success and potential. And I think that actually ends up... It ends up being a tax over time.

Lenny (16:36):
That's a really good point, I didn't think about asking about that. But in this case it was a startup within a company that did well, and I also agree, it rarely works and it did here. What is it do you think that was so central to making it work? I know you just talked about it, how would you summarize just like, "Here's the thing everyone should do when they're maybe starting something small within a big company that's new"?

Ayo Omojola (16:57):
There are some macro things where, I do believe we were children of fortune, like mobile, et cetera. When I joined Cash App a lot of the people working on it were fairly tenured, both at Square and just like in their careers, and had done sort of really meaningful things. And as a consequence, I do think there's like... This is a thing I haven't quite been able to articulate well, but there was something around a small, tightly-knit senior team super focused on a problem. And the smallness means just like, less prior miscommunication, and then the tightly-knit means a lot more trust. And then I think Brian was obviously just, he'd been at Square for a long time, he knew the organization well, was a color operator on there, knew like talent, like who was good that he wanted to bring on board.

(17:52):
And I think that combination of things... Well, not my guess is, there are other things. But I think without that thing, it would actually have been really, really difficult.

Lenny (18:02):
I think that's an awesome lesson, just like a small, trusted team that has seniority, and leadership trusts to operate and not just like, "Hey, what the hell are you doing? It's time to share faster."

Ayo Omojola (18:15):
The Cash App team stayed super senior for a long time.

Lenny (18:19):
Mm-hmm. And you said small, how small would you... Was it/what do you recommend when you say it should be a small team for something like this?

Ayo Omojola (18:27):
You know, a lot depends on the thing, I don't think there's a one-shot answer. When I joined Cash App it was like 11 or 12, and it wasn't much more than that for like a year. And I forget how big it was when I left, but we had real scale in a real business before we had a real head count, I guess is the way I would say it.

Lenny (18:27):
Love it, yeah.

Ayo Omojola (18:53):
And you kind of had to fight for every head count. And I think the head count at this point was a Sarah Fryer thing from Square, she was just really, really disciplined about making sure that if you were trying to bring people on and spend the company's money, you really just fight it.

Lenny (19:07):
I think that's a really good takeaway. Let's transition to talking about what you're currently doing, Carbon Health. You went from consumer fin tech to consumer health tech, first of all just real quick, just how did that transition happen? Was that something you planned, or is that just like you went on exploring and that's where you ended up?

Ayo Omojola (19:22):
It was more I went on exploring, that's where I ended up. I'd say there was maybe three parts, there's one part where when I was exploring there was this guy, Russell Fradin, who now works at Carbon, who had... He introduced me to like a third of my network in Silicon Valley. And basically he said, "Hey, there's this guy who's amazing, he was the founder of Udemy, and now he started this company called Carbon Health. His name's Eren, you need to talk to him." And I was like, "Sure." And Eren, I met, and Eren is brilliant, and also had this crazy way of explaining a complex problem in a way that made the solution obvious. And so he was like, "Oh yeah," like, "Here's how we're going to do it, and here's the thing we spent two and a half hours together."

(20:17):
And then at the end I was like, "Oh yeah, this is obvious, somebody should just build this thing." And then I think the second part was, I think everyone's the hero in their own story, I'm no different. So I think when I left Cash App, and when I was thinking about [inaudible 00:20:33] I was thinking of starting a company and doing all this stuff. And one of the muscles that we really just spent a lot of time building Cash App was going really, really deep into like the regulatory sort of wallpaper of the problems we were trying to solve. And so we would have sessions where we'd be sitting in a room, like product, engineering, legal, compliance, et cetera, with some regs literally blown up on a projector screen, and a section of text highlighted, and being like, "Hey, what does this really mean?

(21:02):
"Okay, what if we build a product this way? What if we structure money movement this way," et cetera. And so I casted myself instead as, "Hey, what if I could be good at regulated businesses, instead of just good at money?" And that was the way that I tied the two together. There were a bunch of other sort of very personal ego things, like, "I want to build a team that's mostly founders." Both my parents were doctors, and I'd been through some sort of scary experiences in the healthcare system. So there was just like a part of it that was about sort of mission and background, but the career part was really about, how do you stick the two things together? And I also wanted to learn... There was this thing that happened in my like fourth year at Cash App where I was like, "Oh, there's this other thing that we have to build that would be amazing if we actually built it."

(21:54):
Which is what Pinwheel, the company I'm on the board of, actually is. So I was like, "Hey, we've got to build this platform for payroll," it's like the last giant money movement thing that hasn't really come to move the needle in a long time. And I couldn't get the organization convinced to build it, which kind of is what it is, A. And B, I was like, "Oh, I want to have that insight. Can I have that insight of like what the second thing is faster the same time around?" And I am sad to report that three years in Carbon, I have not had it yet.

Lenny (22:27):
You've got a lot going on, I am not surprised. So I was going to ask, what draws you towards highly-regulated industries being at Cash App? And I like that you already went there, basically you just found that that's maybe the thing that you could get really smart at, and that applies to a lot of different markets. That's an interesting insight about yourself, like, "This could be the thing that I get good at."

Ayo Omojola (22:48):
Yeah, yeah, or differentially better at than other people.

Lenny (22:51):
You kind of like mentioned this off to the side, this idea that you like to hire founders. And can you speak more to that, just like what that means in your day-to-day, and then maybe how your team looks today. Is it mostly founders, or some [inaudible 00:23:05]?

Ayo Omojola (23:04):
Yeah, yeah. I think the team looks today about half and half. So I had this experience going through IC, where... And just kind of growing up, my career in Silicon Valley, where I knew a bunch of founders who were absolute beasts, like incredible people, could do amazing things, and they would bounce off organizations. They would be like, "All right, I'm going to go work at Amazon," and just not last. And when I was at Cash App I went through a bunch of hiring processes where I was like, "Hey, we should try and hire some founders to do this, look at these companies," et cetera. And a thing that would happen that... And this part really isn't about founders, although founders are like one way sort of this happens.

(23:49):
But a thing that would happen quite often is, by the time that as a hiring manager you get a bunch of resumes to look at, like you post the job, a bunch of people apply, you're partnering with a sourcer, by the time you get a bunch of resumes to look at they've screened out everyone that doesn't just like fit inside a box. And it's like, at Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and then at certain set of schools, and then a certain type of experience, et cetera. And so what would happen is like, if you just happened to not look like that profile I don't even see you. And I would say, "Hey, I would like to hire some non-traditional candidates here who were like founders or whatever," and I would just never get it.

(24:33):
It was almost like the machine just worked a certain way, like there was an algorithm, and the algorithm was upstream of me. And I had this belief that sort of these people that I had seen, many of whom have now gone on to start companies that are doing quite well, would be incredible value add. Like basically, it's kind of like, if you could just hold onto a rock for a little bit it can take you pretty far. And so this was one of the things I talked to Eren about actually, early on when I joined Carbon. And I was literally in the job posting, I'd be like, "If you've been a founder before, even if your startup has failed, please apply to this." Because [inaudible 00:25:15] anything common among founders too is, there's like this sort of imposter syndrome that goes hand-in-hand with the chip on the shoulder.

(25:24):
And so my team's much smaller now than it was, but I probably I think the whole time that I've been at Carbon, hired about 15% founders. And I'm actually 100% certain the thesis was right, and I think it just came with costs that were kind of theoretical at the time, and now they're real. I think like the two big costs are if there's any waste or bullshit in your organization, like they fucking see it right away and call it out. And so there's this like, you have to... There are just these scenarios where I'd just be like, I just have to sit and listen to somebody tell me all the things that we're doing wrong. So there's one, it's a way to cut through bullshit, that's one cost. And then I think the second cost is, and I say cost as in like it is not better for the organizations. You have these people come in, they're incredible.

(26:30):
And you really can only keep them for like two, or two and a half years. And so what ends up happening is, they're just like, "Oh, I want to..." Obviously if you're going to be a person that starts a company you're ambitious, so they're like, "I'm going to run a team somewhere else, I'm going to go try some other thing, I'm going to go build a company." And so it's kind of like a team that I think is differentially higher output, but also differentially higher attrition on the market.

Lenny (26:55):
Got it. I was going to ask about the cons, and I like that you shared them already, because I imagine working with a lot of founders adds a lot of stress too.

Ayo Omojola (27:02):
Yeah. I mean, it is unequivocally awesome, like I love it. And I think that the unexpected pro also is, I do think it levels up the team. Like people in a team that is very founder-dense really likes it, and we ended up over time in Carbon like, there was lots of people who founded companies here in multiple functions, not just profit.

Lenny (27:24):
Today's episode is brought to you by LMNT. I just recently discovered this stuff, actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. LMNT is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio, and unlike most electrolyte drinks there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten, or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. LMNT is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes, also dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on LMNT to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams, and the Marines.

(28:05):
You can try LMNT totally risk-free, if you don't like it you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drink, L-M-N-T.com/lenny, and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drink, L-M-N-T.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty. While we're on this topic of team-building and hiring, do you have any other lessons and approaches that you've found to be effective in hiring or team-building? Just general rules of thumb, or philosophies?

Ayo Omojola (28:46):
My biggest thing, and I say this all the time, is when you're hiring you pick the people, but they pick when. So you're actually like, there's these people... There are many, many people on the team who, the time between when I first met them and the time when they joined the team was like months. There was one person who was like, a year and a half almost. And so the way that I operationalize that is, I'm meeting people all the time, and I am just like, "Hey," like, if I meet somebody I want to work with, I'm like, "Hey, how can I add value to your life so you will consider me somebody who you would like to work with one day, so that when the time comes and there's an opportunity for us to work together, you're actually open to it, as opposed to just some guy that you met on a Zoom one time."

(29:31):
And I would say that's like the biggest... The biggest thing is just like, trying to be like, one of my core philosophies in life is that everybody wants something. And most of the time it's not something you have to give, or you can connect them to. But, if it is something that you have to give, or you can connect them to, it's criminal not to, actually. It's like, imagine you, like just imagine you having a conversation with somebody, and that person, knowing that you want something, having it, there's no cost enough to give it to you, and they just don't do it. How crazy is that? And so the way that I sort of bring this to life is, if I meet somebody who I want to work with, I'm like straight up with them about it.

(30:16):
And I'm like, "Hey, I hope we can find a way to work together one day. In the meantime, it looks like the things you want are not to work with me right now, but they look like this kind of [inaudible 00:30:26] things which I'm aware of. Can I connect you to this person, this opportunity, what have you?" And it's not my thing, like actually Russ did this for me when I came just looking by for the first time. He was like, "Hey, I'm not going to invest in your company, I think it's stupid. But here are all these people who might, go meet them." And that was like transformational for me, and it has turned out that over a long enough time horizon it does come back, and you just don't hold the cards close to your chest, just give them away.

Lenny (30:54):
Is there a story or an example of that that comes to mind of you doing that for someone else?

Ayo Omojola (30:59):
No, it's a little bit of a professional hazard because I'm an angel investor, and so I do this for a lot of my founders. But I probably made 600 intros last year, and that probably drove like, at least one person signed up somewhere as an advisor, a couple people took some jobs, a bunch of angel investors invested in companies, a couple of companies found leads for around like, I think it's... I'm not special in this way by the way, like a lot of people do this. It's just, I am very aggressive about it.

Lenny (31:30):
And you're also connected to a lot of people, as you've shared, because of all these things you've done, and the fact that you prioritize this. I think it's a really cool combination of, you really prioritize connecting and helping. Plus you know a lot of people from all the work that you've done, and there's this element you just shared which is just like, give people things that they want, because [inaudible 00:31:49]-

Ayo Omojola (31:49):
Yeah, I'm a reasonably good matchmaker, except in love. Never once introduced two people that dated.

Lenny (31:57):
Let's talk about... No, we'll move on from that. I also think I'm zero, zero for some denominator, I don't even know. I'm going to keep fishing this pool of kind of philosophies of how you build product, and then we'll come back to Carbon Health. I was reading something that you wrote about how you're really big on understanding the thing, like going deep on stuff, just generally as a product leader and as a collaborator. Can you just talk about your approach there, and where you apply that philosophy?

Ayo Omojola (32:27):
This I took away from Cash App, there was... When we were working on the Cash Card, the very first... This is like 2015, 2016, the very first iteration of Cash Card, the head of design at Cash App, this guy Robert Anderson, who's an amazing designer, please hire him if you can, had like this design. He was like, "Hey, I have this design, we're going to do this thing." And I'm like, "Great." I get some sketch files, maybe? PDFs, pre-figma. We mailed them to some card vendors, and the things they send us back are like, you would put this out as the product in your life, in the world? Like, what are you doing? And the consequence, Brian was like, "Hey, we just need somebody to go figure out how to get this thing made." And so I ended up spending a long time just going to different card manufacturing factories around the country, to figure out how do cards get made, what are the possibilities?

(33:26):
Is there new tech we can take advantage of, will the people even talk to us? Is the thing we're talking about even possible? And we ended up doing... At the time there was a... I wouldn't say like super new, it had been on the [inaudible 00:33:38] for a few years, but it wasn't on mainstream cards yet, this concept of laser engraving. And it turns out that the machine that you use to make laser-engraved cards has like thousands of combinations of settings, which all create like a different physical effect. Like you can increase the power setting and literally burn the plastic, and you would get kind of a red, rough texture. And you could decrease power settings, decrease the aperture, and you would get like a really fine, smooth consistency.

(34:09):
And this is like, again, a thing that I learned, which we went through. Between plastic, the overlay, the paper, the envelope, and the finishes, easily 1,000 combinations before we got to like the first version of the Cash Card that was shipped. And there's a team still there, still doing like literally physical card objects that are not the same as anything that exists in-market, just like going into differentiation thing. And then a lot of the stuff we did around our regulatory work, around prepaid, building a digital wallet, et cetera, made me realize that like a thing that would happen very frequently is, you want to work on something and you go talk to an expert. And usually for most people, an expert is not like, hey, the most expert person in the world, because that's a very, very hard thing to know who that is, especially when you're not an expert.

(35:08):
Usually an expert is the most tenured person in the world in the domain that you're questioning, and the length of tenure, and the depth of experience actually can vary very wildly from person to person. And so what happened is like, you go ask somebody something, and they would give you an answer which is like the thing that they believe to be true, they're not lying and it's not malicious, and it's just fucking wonk. And you just have to keep pushing until you get to an answer, like I don't really know the right way to articulate this all the way. But its kind of like, you can't stop until you get to the end. And that's one of the reasons why being in a domain that matters is really important, because that's a very, very expensive activity to do if you're in a small team environment.

(35:55):
So the way that I apply that today, and I'm sure people at Carbon will tell you this, is I end up asking lots of questions that people think don't matter, because I'm like, "Hey, we're trying to optimize something." And usually what I find is, when you're trying to optimize something for the first time they haven't optimized for it. You actually have to re-measure it, you have to re-instrument it, you have to like rebuild all the queries, all the visuals, et cetera from scratch. You have to look at them like 15 different ways, and then every time two things are incongruent you have to go and figure out why, and it's just like tedious work. And in regulated industries, and I think this is...

(36:38):
My guess is this will end up being true in almost any complex environment with a lot of variables, that are kind of... And the more sort of constrained [inaudible 00:36:48] they are, I think actually the more this matters, you can't avoid the details, you just have to get into them. And if you don't, you can still do well but it's actually more than likely fortune than skill.

Lenny (36:58):
You said you ask these questions that don't matter. Is there an example recently? Because that's a really interesting concept, of just a question you asked, or questions you like to ask that are just like, "God damn it, why are you asking these questions?"

Ayo Omojola (37:10):
Yeah. I have, there's like one from yesterday where-

Lenny (37:12):
Yeah, perfect.

Ayo Omojola (37:14):
... there is a field in a database table that tells you why a payment was made. And there's a bunch of values in that field that are very articulate, like, "Hey, this payment was made because it was co-pay, this payment was made because it was the patient was visiting without insurance," right? And then there's like a field, and it's empty. There's a value that's just null, and we use null as like, "Hey..." The way null is described is, after a claim is adjudicated and complete, and the patient has a balance, we leave that field blank if we're just billing the patient for their balance. The problem with that is, if there is any other exception or reason why a payment might occur, and we're in a complex environment, we have over 120 clinics, there's a lot of humans who can press the pay button in a bunch of different places, you will not know if it's included in that field, in that null value field.

(38:15):
And so this is like one of those things where I'm in the middle of a Slack with a colleague who's like, "Why are you asking this question?" And I'm like, "I just need us to put residual balance in that field, if that's what it's for. That's all I'm asking." So I do that a lot, and you know, I think people hate it.

Lenny (38:37):
Did they actually go ahead and do that?

Ayo Omojola (38:39):
We're in the middle of it right now.

Lenny (38:40):
You're in Slack? Okay, right, okay, I love this. So I made a list of kind of these lessons, and I really like this area we're diving into, of just your kind of philosophies to work in life. So just the ones I wrote down is, the importance of going deep, and doing the thing yourself, and not trusting that somebody's response is the end. I love the way you phrased it, of don't stop until you've reached the end, this idea of helping people if you can, connecting people and the power of that, having founders, and working with founders. And clearly the story you just told is very founder mentality, of just like going in the warehouse and trying 100 different cards. Is there more here? What else have you found to be an important approach to leadership, or product building, or things along those lines.

Ayo Omojola (39:29):
Yeah. Can I say one caveat about the first one I think you wrote down?

Lenny (39:34):
Yes.

Ayo Omojola (39:34):
It's not that you have to do everything yourself, it's that the person who you trust in the execution role, they have to become the expert. They have to be like, they can't stop until they hit the end. And, I don't know. I think in all these places where strong, ambitious people are trying big things, so much value is lost when the person in the execution role isn't really in command of all the details, and is like... So I think the reality's like, to do ambitious things you have to work with people, I can't do everything myself and I know that. The real lesson there is, it's not like I have to, just, somebody has to. And you know, they have to know that that's like what you're holding them accountable for, and that you trust them to do that, and the organization's trusting them to do that as well.

Lenny (40:30):
How do you actually operationalize that? It sounds like part of it is to hire founders who naturally want to do the thing well. Is there anything else in terms of how you set up the team where like, this person has power to do the things that need to be done? Is it like an autonomy perspective? Is there anything else you do that allows for that in a product team, in a company?

Ayo Omojola (40:48):
It's like a trust but verify, and I think it's just almost never enough for someone to say, "I can't do it because X person said." It is, "I can't do it because we are contractually obligated to do this another way, and if we do not honor the contract these will be the consequences." And another thing I like to do kind of along this is like, "Okay, articulate to me what actually will happen if we don't do it this way. Like, what will break? Like, are they going to fine us, is the patient going to be..." Do you know what I mean? Because in my mind there are many things that are used as excuses, because some person's understanding of how some regulatory thing works from like their last job is being applied here, where you're literally creating a worse experience for your consumer, for your patient. I'm like, "Why would you... If we're not here to try and make the experience better for them, why are we even here?"

Lenny (41:43):
Let's come back to Carbon Health for a bit, I just have a couple of questions that I wanted to touch on. One is just about starting a company in healthcare, in health tech, there's so many companies that launch every day, every week, trying to make the healthcare industry better in various ways. But for all these reasons, I don't know, the incentives are off, there's regulatory capture, there's things take a long time, things just like often don't work. Carbon Health is an example of something that is working really well. What is your advice often to founders who want to go after the healthcare space as a tech company? What do you need to know, what should you do right, do wrong? What is your advice there?

Ayo Omojola (42:23):
Yeah, so one thing I would say in healthcare that fortunately or unfortunately I think is true, is very often the way to make things happen is network-dependent, not necessarily about the merit of the thing itself. So it's just like, there's companies that exist because the founders know the CEO of every major payer in the country, and so there's just like a deal they can get, or data they can get that's not available in any other context. So I think there's just a thing there of understanding if that's the business that you're in. I think in Eren and Caesar's case in Carbon, because we're direct to consumer, we're not trying to sell to payers, we're not trying to sell to employers. And Eren, obviously just hugely successful, [inaudible 00:43:13] person starting the largest education platform on the planet at Udemy.

(43:18):
There was actually really, really good founder market fit, he was a person who had very, very technical, and had a ton of DTC success doing another thing that was DTC. But there are businesses, like there's a company that I recently invested on working with, where the founders are incredible and very, very technical, and not super high on network. And so a lot of what I try to do with them is like, "Hey, I need this person to talk to this person. And then also, this is like a really crisp, specific use case that you need to optimize around." And maybe I'm wrong, who cares, I'm just some guy. What does it matter what I think? It doesn't have to be what I think, it just has to be crisp. And using that as a way to like... Because the more crisp it is, the easier it is going to be for you to know who the decision-maker and the organization you need to get to is.

(44:05):
Because I just find... I'm sure you see this in B2B, this is so much... There's just so much leverage in knowing the person in the place who actually has their finger on the button, versus trying to network your way in, and people don't want to spend their social capital introducing you to this department, or they've just got like 19 other things going on. So I think that network thing is just a thing that sticks in my mind, that when I see a lot of healthcare tech startups swimming through the soup, a lot of it is about there's some organizations that have to navigate to get to the right decision-maker, and they have to do it 100 times. And so much of it is like, just waiting for the guy who promised me the intro to make the intro.

Lenny (44:48):
That is really good and practical advice. Before we wrap up, I want to give you a chance just to describe Carbon Health for folks that may not be familiar with it. Just like, what is it, where can you use it, how do you sign up, who's it for?

Ayo Omojola (45:00):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh great, yeah, very, very happy to do this ad, it is a paid ad because Carbon Health pays me. So-

Lenny (45:08):
No-one's paying me, I'm losing in this situation.

Ayo Omojola (45:12):
I'm paying you in prestige, Lenny.

Lenny (45:14):
Yes, in wisdom, in insights, and your attention, yeah.

Ayo Omojola (45:17):
Yeah, exactly, exactly. So, Carbon is an extremely vertically integrated healthcare provider based in the United States. By extremely vertically integrated, what I mean is we build and run the clinics, the providers work for carbon, and we build and run the software, and we run the entire operation, and it's all like full stack in-house. And when I say we build our own software it's like, wait, how you book, how you pay, the literal buttons that the provider presses to say, "Hey, Lenny's blood pressure looks good," all of that is software that we build in-house, all the way from front, from like the patient clicking book an appointment on Google.com to the claim being sent to the insurer, we build the whole thing full stack ourselves.

(46:04):
We have, I want to say 130 clinics around the country, I believe we're in about 17 states. We do virtual care, I think we're one of the biggest healthcare providers in California, and we do both urgent care and primary care. And the thing that gets me super-excited about Carbon is, a lot of the experiences we build are the things that as a consumer, you believe should exist in healthcare. So I want to say, last year we launched this diabetes program where you slap on a continuous glucose monitor, you link it to Carbon, and it streams your blood glucose measurements directly into our EMR natively, and your providers can see it and interact with you around it. They can help intervene, they can tell you like new dietary, lifestyle choices to make. And we're going to do that with every device at some point, on some scale, and you don't have to pay $200 a month to use it. $200 a year-

Lenny (46:04):
Amazing.

Ayo Omojola (46:55):
... to use it, sorry.

Lenny (46:59):
Amazing. Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, I'm going to go through them pretty quick. We'll see what comes to mind, no pressure, you can skip them too if you want. You ready?

Ayo Omojola (47:11):
Yeah.

Lenny (47:13):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Ayo Omojola (47:17):
Three-Body Problem, Children of Time Trilogy, and Stormlight Archive.

Lenny (47:24):
And are these all sci-fi books?

Ayo Omojola (47:26):
The third is fantasy.

Lenny (47:29):
Good clarification, great. Amazing. I'm reading an epic sci-fi book right now called The Fire in the Deep.

Ayo Omojola (47:37):
Oh dude, amazing.

Lenny (47:39):
Okay, yes.

Ayo Omojola (47:40):
So, something that's going to really piss you off... I don't think this is a spoiler.

Lenny (47:43):
Don't, don't, no spoilers, I'm almost done.

Ayo Omojola (47:45):
It's not a spoiler. The story's not finished.

Lenny (47:52):
Mm-hmm, there's like additional books that aren't done yet?

Ayo Omojola (47:55):
Yeah. And I don't even know if they're being written, it's brutal.

Lenny (47:58):
That's okay. I find that the first book, except for the Three-Body Problem where the first book is the worst book, I feel like with this and many of these books, the first one is like... I'm just going to stop I think at the first one, that's my plan.

Ayo Omojola (48:11):
So I'd say, the other two are in my opinion very clever explorations of types of intelligence, from [inaudible 00:48:19]-

Lenny (48:18):
Excellent timing for studying what might happen with AGI. Great, I love where this is going. Next question, what's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Ayo Omojola (48:29):
War of the Worlds was exceptional.

Lenny (48:32):
Is that recent?

Ayo Omojola (48:34):
Yeah, there's one that I think that it was a three-season thing, just ended maybe last year. And it's like a kind of more modern take, and it's just very thoughtful, and it's sci-fi, but such deep drama. I also love Succession, but I haven't got through season two yet.

Lenny (48:52):
Man, this season is incredible.

Ayo Omojola (48:55):
I know, I know.

Lenny (48:56):
You've got to get there, you've got to get there.

Ayo Omojola (48:58):
I know, I had to mute it on Twitter because I was like, "You guys are ruining it for me."

Lenny (49:01):
Oh man, that's impossible to avoid. You just have to delete your Twitter account, I think is the only strategy. There's an amazing Twitter account called No Context Succession, and they just-

Ayo Omojola (49:11):
Love it, love it.

Lenny (49:12):
... yeah, and they just tweet random clips. But it's going to totally [inaudible 00:49:15]-

Ayo Omojola (49:15):
My favorite Succession meme is the Kendall on the phone, "It would be good to connect, it would just be good to connect," just like, such a metaphor for life.

Lenny (49:27):
Interesting, very subtle. Oh, I see what you're saying. That feels so appropriate to you, Ayo. Just connecting people, it's like the core of your being. I could see why you love that meme. Next question, what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're hiring, interviewing?

Ayo Omojola (49:43):
This one's not super crisp, it's like there's kind of two sides to the question. It's like a, tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work, or tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work. Like, tell me a bad decision that worked out, or a good decision that did not, is like I think the way to frame it. And it's a lot of like, my process is just teasing out introspection, it's just like, "Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked, and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions?"

Lenny (50:14):
Final question, do you have a pro tip for mailing something or shipping something from your experience helping everyone on Quora mail and ship stuff?

Ayo Omojola (50:24):
I'd say my biggest hack is like, if you're doing anything local where you're just like taking something point-to-point, Uber can do it for you.

Lenny (50:32):
Mm-hmm, a courier.

Ayo Omojola (50:33):
I literally sent somebody cookies recently, and I was like, "Oh." A guy showed up at my house, I gave him a bag of cookies, and my friend texted me a couple hours later and was like, "Thank you."

Lenny (50:47):
That is a hack. Ayo, this was amazing, you're an amazing human, I really appreciate you making time for this. Thank you for being-

Ayo Omojola (50:47):
Thanks, man.

Lenny (50:53):
... here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, but more maybe ask you followup questions? And, how can listeners be useful to you?

Ayo Omojola (51:02):
I am on Twitter @ay_o, and I write at kunle.app, K-U-N-L-E.app. And the way listeners can be useful to me is tell me what I'm wrong about, I love that. Just be like, "Hey, you said this thing. It's false, here's an example of why," I love that.

Lenny (51:23):
I love these answers to this question, because people love to leave comments on YouTube, and so we'll see-

Ayo Omojola (51:23):
Oh, sweet.

Lenny (51:29):
... what comes in. We'll see what the YouTubers find for us.

Ayo Omojola (51:31):
Oh God, what did I just sign up for?

Lenny (51:33):
We'll find out, here we go.

Ayo Omojola (51:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (51:36):
All right, well thank you again so much for being here, and bye everyone.

Ayo Omojola (51:40):
Awesome, thanks for doing this. Thanks for having me.

# Category creation and brand building | Barbra Gago (Pando, Miro, Greenhouse, Culture Amp)

## Transcript

Barbra Gago (00:00):
When you're building a category, you need to make sure that there is a category that's validated by analysts and directory sites and things like that. But also, you want to have a lot of traction in terms of thought leadership like why is this the category? What are the unique value propositions of this particular thing? What are the pain points it solves? And then of course, getting a lot of content around because when you're generating a new category, you're also needing to educate buyers that there is a category that they can now budget for and why they should allocate budget for that.

Lenny (00:40):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard learned experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.

Lenny (00:54):
Today, my guest is Barbra Gago. Barbra was chief marketing officer and global head of Marketing at Miro where she helped build their global brand and create a whole new software category for the space. Before that, she was VP of marketing at Greenhouse where she brought the product to market and led their go-to market strategy. And she was also head of marketing at CultureAmp where she helped build their go-to market plan and close their first 50 customers.

Lenny (01:18):
In our conversation, we focus on three topics: creating your own category, when it makes sense to explore that, when to avoid it and how to go about it; building your brand and rebranding when it makes sense to, and building opinionated software. I've never seen a post or a podcast get as deep into category creation or rebranding, and I'm confident that you will learn something valuable from this podcast. With that, I bring you Barbra Gago.

Lenny (01:46):

Lenny (04:05):
Barbra, welcome to the podcast.

Barbra Gago (04:07):
Thanks, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (04:10):
Just to start off and set a little context for our listeners, can you give us a 55-second background on some of the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're up to now?

Barbra Gago (04:21):
Definitely. So I've spent pretty much my entire career in B2B SaaS tech, building and scaling through hyper growth, oftentimes with disruptive technologies at the center of people, tech, future of work. I would say I helped bring products like CultureAmp and Greenhouse to market in the people space. Before that, I did some work in enterprise social networking in the Yammer days. And most recently, I was the CMO at Miro where I also led the rebrand and introduced that product to the world, which was very exciting.

Lenny (05:01):
And you've got a startup now, so maybe you just mention that briefly and then we'll talk about it at the end again. Yeah. What are you working on now?

Barbra Gago (05:08):
Yeah. And now, I'm building a product which we'll see about the category what it ends up being, but it's what we call an employee progression platform. So basically, from the work that I've done as a leader, building and scaling teams and also the exposure I've had in the people tech space, I just have found that there's been a lot of tools lacking for leaders to really coach and develop their team in the right way, creating enough structure and transparency into the process that creates accountability on both sides. So yeah, we're taking on the big goal of killing performance reviews.

Lenny (05:49):
Holy moly. Cool.

Barbra Gago (05:50):
Very exciting

Lenny (05:51):
Performance reviews. Very exciting. It's true. We'll talk about that a bit at the end more. And there's a bunch of stuff I want to dig into. You have such a cool background on so many interesting experiences. The first is something that you mentioned just now, which is category and category creation, which I know is near and dear to your heart. I was reading a bit about your background, and I learned that at Miro, you invented this category that's now called visual collaboration. And at CultureAmp, I think you helped lead the creation of this category, employee experience. I imagine at Greenhouse, you did something similar. And I know startups are often trying to decide, should I create my own category? Should I try to win in an existing category? And so I want to spend some time talking through your experience there.

Lenny (06:32):
And so the first question is just say at Miro or Greenhouse, can you just talk through your thought process of trying to decide, should we invent a whole new category that we're going to win or should we just try to win an existing category and how did that go?

Barbra Gago (06:45):
They're both great examples because in one, we did create a new category and in the other, we tried and abandoned ship. With Miro, I think when I joined the company, there was this concept of an online whiteboard, which also is a category, but it's a much smaller category and it wasn't something that a lot of people searched for. And I think the biggest motivating factor of thinking about category creation at Miro was how do we become something really big and needed by every company and not just this little thing that maybe product teams would use or maybe engineering teams or schools or something like that.

Barbra Gago (07:26):
When you're thinking about category creation, it's really, for us, it was really about the scope of what we're trying to do and not wanting to be in something too small. And I think with Miro, the platform that it is, there is so much possibility. I used to joke that it was, even as a company, we were the ever expanding universe. There's just so much to do there, but online whiteboard was really small.

Barbra Gago (07:52):
Greenhouse is in the ATS category, which is applicant tracking system. And at the time, applicant tracking systems had a really bad name. I don't know if folks that listen to this know of Jobvite or remember Jobvite, and there were a lot of systems before that. Jobvite had come in the mid-2000s as the new and improved ATS and it was all about social recruiting, but it was very transactional and it wasn't very strategic. And so we wanted to steer clear of the ATS space even though we were an ATS. We can talk more about what we tried and what we ended up doing, but I think the main factors when you're thinking about category creation is really what budget companies have, if they have a budget, if they don't have a budget. Companies did have a budget for ATS, for example. Until now, I don't think companies had a budget for visual collaboration. For example, what's the language and the words that people use to describe their pain points and their situation, the things that they need? And then is their competition?

Barbra Gago (08:59):
And sometimes, competition, you would think like, "Oh, we want to not have competition, so let's build a new category." But ultimately, you're not building a category until there is competition. It's not officially actually a category until there's more companies that do that. And that was a big learning for me in this whole process of category creation, is that it's actually okay when new companies come in that say they're that category because it's just validating the fact that there is a new category. So I think it's really ... If and when is really about what the overall objective is and also what the current situation is with competitors and the space. The ATS market is still the ATS market, for example, and Miro has created visual collaboration as a category but also ticks off boxes for other categories as well.

Lenny (09:53):
I have a thousand questions I want to ask to dig deeper. Before we get in there, can you just define, well, what is a category? Folks that are just like, what the hell have you been talking about? What is a product category? What's the high level way to think about this?

Barbra Gago (10:04):
When we talk about category, I think it's really what would be a good way to explore your space and your relevant categories would be to go to G2 Crowd or Software Advice or any of those type of review sites or directory sites and learn about how they've categorized products based on feature sets. And so within each industry, there's going to be a bunch of different types of categories. Those categories are typically products that solve, at least in B2B products, that solve a certain pain point or a set of pain points, and they can be very wide like all in one and big solutions or they can be narrow. There's this all in one versus best in class, for example. And I think that's where the granularity of category comes into play and then how big the market is. Obviously, maps to granularity versus more broad and when are you granular versus when do you go broad? But I think ultimately, it's just a set of features or products that are solving a specific pain point that customers most likely have a budget allocated for.

Lenny (11:17):
And then the category ends up, the way you use it is it's the way you pitch your product often. It's like the big part of the headline, part of the way you sell it. It's like you come back to this we're the leader in visual collaboration, for example, or that's how it practically ends up being used.

Barbra Gago (11:31):
Exactly. It's interesting because I would say that if you're building a category as well, you can sometimes be selling into a category while you're still building the appetite for a different category, which is a nuance, which is all about where's the budget and how do customers describe their pain points?

Lenny (11:53):
This reminds me, I was just trying to pitch my podcast in this little dock I'm writing. And initially, I was like, "Oh, it's like a top hundred business podcast." And I'm like, "No, it's the number one product and growth podcast in the world," which is true, but I created my own category. How about that?

Barbra Gago (12:09):
There you go.

Lenny (12:10):
Was that a good idea?

Barbra Gago (12:11):
I think so. The thing is it's like when you talk about ICP for how you're going to sell your product and really build a repeatable sales process to scale that piece of your business. And the more specific the thing is that you're selling initially, obviously you're going to have more relevant users. They're going to spread word of mouth, etc. You could always expand that scope later. The category can also evolve. You mentioned CultureAmp earlier. The category now is people experience. Actually, when I was there, it was more about people analytics platform or people intelligence platform because we were providing a deep set of data that companies didn't have before, but that category has since evolved as their go-to market has changed, as they've added new products to their platform and new features and things like that.

Lenny (13:06):
To make it even more concrete for people, what are other examples of categories that come to mind that are either invented recently or just generally?

Barbra Gago (13:14):
In the early days, I was working on market automation, for example, so Marketo, now HubSpot, fits into that, even though back then, they were more of this inbound marketing platform/category performance management, which is the area of Pando. We've talked a lot about people, products. I think Gainsight did a great job with the customer success platform, so this is a different problem that they were solving within the organization for a group. The customer success team, basically how are they going to make their customers successful?

Lenny (13:49):
Awesome.

Barbra Gago (13:50):
Okay.

Lenny (13:51):
Yeah, customer success. It's a well name.

Barbra Gago (13:53):
Yes.

Lenny (13:55):
Okay. There's many benefits to try to create your own category, right? We're number one. That's one main category. Two is you can lead the charge on understanding or just defining what's important. I imagine there's other benefits maybe you could share, but there's also probably a lot of downsides. You mentioned oftentimes, it doesn't work and it just ends up being a lot of wasted money. Maybe just talk about what are the reasons to pursue trying to create your own category and then some of the reasons you maybe shouldn't.

Barbra Gago (14:20):
Greenhouse is a great example to talk about a failed approach at creating a category. So I mentioned before the ATS or the applicant tracking system category at the time was just, it carried so much disdain. People had such bad experiences with that whole category of products. No matter what, they weren't strategic. They didn't help people be good at recruiting. It was just a pretty terrible, very transactional experience. And I came in and it was like, "Okay, let's reposition ourselves. We're going to create a new category." We tried several things.

Barbra Gago (14:57):
One of the main things that we zeroed in on was recruiting optimization platform, and it was really like we are doing that. We're helping companies really structure the process, identify where they have gaps, where people are falling through the cracks, where they're flying through the process and really tweak and iterate it and improve it. And we spent time getting content out there, talking to press about it, positioning it in this way. And ultimately, at the end of the day, the budget that customers had and the way that customers talked about what we did, no matter what we called it, was applicant tracking.

Barbra Gago (15:33):
So it didn't really make sense to continue to go against the grain of, no, we're going to be this new thing or we're going to call it this if everybody, even seeing the value and seeing the differentiation of our platform to others, still called it an ATS. We abandoned that process. But I think the main thing that we understood then was instead of spending the time and money to build a new category, we were going to spend the time and money to elevate the value of this category. So rather than changing the category to something else which we could value at whatever it was, we were just going to spend all of our resources to make this whole category much more valuable to the users, to companies. And that really was, along with what CultureAmp was doing at the time in the same space, what set off this whole trajectory of really good, strong people practices and people organizations that were really doing cool stuff on the recruiting side as well as employee engagement.

Lenny (16:35):
You mentioned a few components of when it makes sense to come up with a category. One is there's budget already against it. Two is people use the words associated with that category. I imagine with Miro and this idea of, what was it, visual collaboration, there wasn't budget for that yet. So how does that work?

Barbra Gago (16:53):
No. That is more of the vision piece, I would say. Sometimes you can have a vision that customers, they don't have it yet or they don't share it, but they can grow to share it and they did in that case. And I think that with Miro, we still worked to optimize where we could in terms of the categories that we did fit into or how people talked about us, but it was also such a new format and it was really a disruptive product that didn't exist before in the enterprise so that it was called a lot of different things. So it was much more fluid and people talked about it in different ways, and this was our way of hearing the feedback about how people talked about it as online whiteboard or lots of jobs to be done were framed, mind mapping platform or diagramming or whatever, all of these little things.

Barbra Gago (17:52):
And so visual collaboration was our way of putting a nice bow around this thing that could then be an enterprise product that solves a lot of different problems for a lot of different use cases and different types of users. We started out selling and having a lot of users that were in product and in engineering and teams that were used to using whiteboards anyway and then needed to do it in a distributed way, but very quickly packaged different types of jobs for HR teams or marketing teams or design teams and pretty much anybody in the organization. But it needed to all come together cohesively; otherwise, it was like everybody in the org just calls it a different thing because they use it in a different way.

Lenny (18:37):
Part of what I'm hearing is that you don't stop working on the other categories that it already sits within and just keep optimizing those but in parallel, start to try to pull together, hey, there's this bigger vision of where this could be. Does that sound right?

Barbra Gago (18:50):
I think so. And it's really where you get the inputs from your customers and your users. We heard all these things. Miro, we did a lot of content marketing. That's a big piece of doing category creation generally I would say. But there's a lot of different ways that people talked about it, and so that's an opportunity to actually come and say, okay, here's what it is because no one knows, and it's all of these things and all of these things together equals this now. And then that created momentum where other companies started thinking like that and then they started tagging themselves as that category as well, and then you had a category of multiple companies now that were doing similar stuff.

Lenny (19:35):
Yeah, absolutely. How do you know when it's probably a bad idea to try to create your own category?

Barbra Gago (19:41):
The sooner, the better if you're going to try and fail and iterate. I think if you already are well established, I don't think category creation is really a meaningful effort if you already have ... It's not going to be necessarily a way to just all of a sudden generate new business by creating Q&A new category once you've already gone far enough down the path. I think that if you're not getting ... With the Greenhouse situation, as much as we used this other language and it did get picked up a bit in terms of context that people would use to talk about Greenhouse, it really just wasn't sticking. And so I think it's good to try things and also abandon them and that's okay. You can always sit back into the category. If you really don't fit into any other category, then you probably do need to figure out what the category is and package that. And that's going to be done mostly by continuing to talk to customers and listening to how they talk about things. It all comes from what you hear from them ultimately and what will resonate.

Barbra Gago (20:49):
So I think, yeah, if you're already established, if you really aren't differentiated from other categories in your space, then you probably are in that category. And doing category creation is a lot of work that is not going to be fruitful if you're pretty squarely in something already. And then if you really aren't but you need to figure it out, you're just going to have to keep iterating until you figure out what makes sense to your customers.

Lenny (21:15):
For founders who are listening to this and they're just like, "Oh, this sounds interesting. I want to try to think about a new category maybe for my product." Can you just talk about the mechanics of going through this process of trying to decide what category it should be called, how to roll it out, anything you could share by just the tactics of creating a category?

Barbra Gago (21:36):
The main thing which we've talked a little bit about already is really understanding your customers and their pain points and how they talk about things. All of my best marketing and positioning literally comes from having a million conversations with customers and listening to how they solve problems and how our system helps them solve problems and what they're doing and how they talk about stuff. I think that's step one, is really understanding who those buyers are, how they talk about the product, what's the unique differentiator and selling points?

Barbra Gago (22:10):
One thing that's really important in category creation as well is actually PR. You need to get this category and positioning out there at a high level in order to test it out and see if it makes sense and if it's resonating. And then the other piece is really those directory sites, which the analysts like Gartner and Forrester and all these guys, at least in B2B and enterprise, they really shape for customers what the categories are. And you need to build relationships with them. You need to work with them to create your category as well. So with the visual collaboration, for example, we weren't ranking, we weren't categorized in visual collaboration on G2 Crowd, and we had to meet with them and explain what it was and talk to them about the differentiation of this category versus other categories in terms of features and all of that stuff so that they could understand how they would differentiate this category from another category.

Barbra Gago (23:15):
So I think those are really good channels to look at. And then tactically, it's a lot of content marketing and a lot of thought leadership. When you're building a category, you need to make sure that there is a category that's validated by analysts and directory sites and things like that. But also, you want to have a lot of traction in terms of thought leadership like why is this the category? What are the unique value propositions of this particular thing? What are the pain points it solves? And then of course, getting a lot of content around because when you're generating a new category, you're also needing to educate buyers that there is a category that they can now budget for and why they should allocate budget for that.

Lenny (24:02):
Sounds like a hell of a lot of work.

Barbra Gago (24:03):
It's a lot.

Lenny (24:05):
I'm curious. What percentage of say B2B companies do you think should pursue creating a category? Is it almost none or is it a meaningful percentage?

Barbra Gago (24:13):
It goes in waves with the tech innovations. So for example, when there was the whole first web wave and then there was this whole social enterprise and consumerization of IT was a big change in how technology occurred in the workplace and a lot of new categories came at that point. So I feel like it's less about the raw percentage and more about general inflection points that are happening that are causing the need for this.

Barbra Gago (24:44):
And I take COVID for example and this very quick shift to distributed work was one of those type of inflection points that has changed a lot. A new category that has grown extremely fast is, and I don't even know exactly what they call it, but it's these employment platforms like Deel and Oyster that have cropped up and grown significantly fast and also have created a new category where there was already the ability to hire people in all of these distributed places, but you had to find a company in that place that would then hire the people. And then of course, they created these platforms where, hey, here's a system, you can manage it all here, we'll go and build all those relationships on the ground. And Nayya is a new set of a new category with four or five companies just in the last three years that have cropped up. So I think it's more about what the market demands and what's happening in the market rather than whether or not one company it makes sense for, if that makes sense.

Lenny (25:48):
Yeah, makes sense. It depends on where the tide is pulling everyone. I think that makes a lot of sense.

Barbra Gago (25:52):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (25:53):
Maybe one last question about category creation. So on the surface, there's this binary choice. Either try to become the best ATS platform or we're not ATS, we're employee recruiting automation. Is there a middle ground? Do you have to go one or the other or is there some in between route, maybe positioning a little bit differently or how do you think about that?

Barbra Gago (26:13):
There could be some middle ground. I would say for Pando, for example, performance management is a very established category that we technically fit into, and also there's a line item on the budget and people have money to pay for performance management. But we're introducing this concept of employee progression, which is more of a long tail strategy. So while we want to educate the market and build this new category of employee progression because it's related to the differences between what we're doing and traditional performance management, we're still going to rate ourselves in directory sites, for example, or categorize ourselves as performance management and talk about performance management and sell to companies that are looking for performance management. But ultimately, we want to shift everybody's mindset and change the category.

Barbra Gago (27:09):
So it's not necessarily one or the other, but I do think the investment is high if you want to build a new category, and we're committed to an investment of time and thought leadership and content and all of that stuff, but it's also not our strategy right now to go and create employee progression and own and dominate this. We're going to work our way up to that over time.

Lenny (27:34):
Got it. That connects to what you talked about with Miro. It wasn't like we're switching, we're now visual collaboration. It's like we're still whiteboards, we're the best white boarding tool, but let's also start building this brand of visual collaboration so that people start to learn.

Barbra Gago (27:48):
Exactly. And I think it's a bottoms up mentality much like our business model was there because with marketing automation, it wasn't a progressive buildup. It was marketing automation. That's what the category was. I was working for a company that was doing marketing automation. There was Eloqua and Marketo and several others and we all were just telling everybody, educating the market on what that was, and that was very top down.

Lenny (28:19):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

Lenny (29:00):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Lenny (29:38):
I know another area that you spend a lot of time thinking about and you've done a lot of work around is branding, rebranding even and just go to market in general. I know at Miro, you led the charge on rebranding Miro. It used to be called I think RealtimeBoard, the little two capital letters and no space.

Barbra Gago (29:52):
Yeah.

Lenny (29:53):
And with Greenhouse, you basically led the go-to market plan. And so I want to spend a little time here I guess just around rebranding. At Miro, it's a rebrand. How do you know it's time to rebrand your product and it's worth investing there?

Barbra Gago (30:06):
RealtimeBoard was interesting. I almost didn't join because it was called RealtimeBoard. Honestly, I was like, "Oh my, god. This is so literal." While I was walking the dogs with my husband, I'm like, "Am I really going to join a company called RealtimeBoard" Can this be a big company with that name?" I was really concerned about it and ultimately, I spent more time with the leaders there and I was like, "Okay, I think they'll be open to changing the name." So I think there's a maturity piece. A lot of companies are started and you just come up with a name and you don't put a lot of thought into it and then you grow to a certain level. At that time, I think we were a million users, maybe a couple of million in revenue so it was very early days. You had a name, you came up with it, you got the website and then the business grew, and at some point, can it be as big as we want it to be, as we think it can be with that name? And I think that was my biggest thing.

Barbra Gago (31:08):
With RealtimeBoard specifically, it was so literal and matter of fact and the product itself had so much more potential than the name was doing justice for. So I think at some point, it's common for companies to do a rebrand once they go into scale mode before you have too many people and before you invest too much obviously in building that brand. So I think the sooner, the better like rebrand before I even joined. Will they let me change the name was my criteria for joining. And I would say in general, the sooner, the better, but obviously after you know that you have product market fit and you have something to scale, so you don't want to invest too much in a brand that isn't going to get you as far as you want to get if you're going to obviously scale.

Lenny (31:58):
I was going to ask you what it took to convince the founders to rebrand because that's often a big challenge, but it sounds like that's part of your employee agreement. I will join if you give me the right to explore this.

Barbra Gago (32:08):
They were pretty receptive to it. The company was not US-based. I had spent my whole career in Silicon Valley a lot of time with brand and inbound and community-focused brands. So they were pretty receptive. It was not that hard to convince them, which was great. I think the scary part for them and many people was just there was some equity. They did have advocates like how would this impact the people who really loved the product right now? And so one of the things that was really important as we transitioned was that we kept as much of the essence of the initial brand. Before, the logo was like a Post-it and then RealtimeBoard. And so that Post-it, for example, that yellow became the new M that we used, and we actually proposed a hot pink M initially and the yellow M was the, okay, we don't want to go too far from the RealtimeBoard with the yellow Post-it and this was a way to nob to the early base of customers and keep something that was pretty standard and pretty core to the initial brand and name.

Lenny (33:25):
Looking back, do you think that was worth the effort and time to worry about those folks?

Barbra Gago (33:29):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (33:30):
Yeah. Okay.

Barbra Gago (33:31):
Oh, the early folk, we definitely got feedback from along the way. We did case studies throughout the process. We got feedback on logos. We got feedback on brand and designs, and there were plenty of people who were like, "Oh, I like RealtimeBoard. It's straightforward." They loved their product, but ultimately, we kept many of them informed and we really involved them in the process to the degree of not slowing us down but still getting feedback, because we did all of this in a very short period of time on top of it. And I think it was worth it because they felt really good about the outcome as well.

Barbra Gago (34:09):
And a big part of rebranding also means that you have to bring the whole company along too and make sure they feel really good about the outcome. And that was probably one of my big takeaways, is just at that time, we were already about a hundred people, so it wasn't a super small company, and everybody had thoughts and feelings and the company had been around for quite a long time before that. So it was a big change for many people.

Lenny (34:38):
Any other learnings from that experience about just going through a branding or rebranding? Maybe just focusing on rebranding. Any other learnings for future rebranding efforts?

Barbra Gago (34:46):
So rebranding is just the visual aesthetic, and I think that's important to make sure you can transition in a way that you're still nodding to the original things but you've reinvented it or transformed it in a way that makes more sense for where you're at and where you're going. If you're changing the name, it's way more complicated because everybody has to be involved, legal, all the contracts, the website, the product, all the links. We changed our URL. Everything changed. And so I think it's really important that you have to mobilize and align and have a very clear vision about the process and the steps and be very transparent about it. I think a lot of times, marketing teams just go and do their thing and come back and it's like, "Here we go."

Barbra Gago (35:34):
With the rebrand at Miro, it was very much rebrand as a product approach. It was very much a product development process with sprint teams and agile, coming back, and you had owners for different parts of things and all reporting back and it really required everybody in some way to be involved. As I mentioned, we did it in a very condensed period of time. I think we kicked off the naming process in end of October and we launched publicly at South by Southwest with a fully three dimensional booth in March. So it was very short to get a name, and then once we had the name, to do all the actual brand and then not only that but produce an entire booth and event collateral and all of that stuff. So I think mobilizing, having a really strong clear process and delegating and letting go in the marketing role, not trying to own everything. It has to be owned by everybody else because you need sales decks and it's just everything.

Barbra Gago (36:39):
I think there's also luck involved with any success and also in rebrands because a million things could go wrong. We got our domain name changed to miro.com, I think it was 48 hours before the event.

Lenny (36:54):
Oh damn.

Barbra Gago (36:54):
All the material had been printed with the new URL. We had to just make a leap of faith, super stressful, but thankfully, we had luck on our side. But ultimately, team process, clear structure, transparent for everybody, getting feedback from customers and making sure stakeholders feel like they're involved. I think ultimately, it's a really powerful way to create defensibility for a product and a brand in the market, but it's also a lot of work related to category creation.

Lenny (37:29):
I was just going to say that. It sounds like everything you do is just a hell of a lot of work. The rest [inaudible 00:37:34].

Barbra Gago (37:35):
It's fun. I love work.

Lenny (37:36):
Me too. I always joke that I work for a workaholic, which is myself.

Barbra Gago (37:40):
Yeah, I do. I know. I just love it. So I get into this stuff and I think rebranding and category creation and brand in general, I think what our goal with Miro was to create ... There's this concept of a love mark rather than a straight mark. It's like how do you build a brand? I think Airbnb has done a great job with that as well, but how do you build a brand that people really love and so committed to and invested in? And that you have to put a lot of thought into it, and it needs to be authentic for it to really work, but if it does, it's super, super powerful.

Lenny (38:22):
Yeah. I was there during the Airbnb rebrand. It took I think a year and a half for them from start to finish to get to something they were really excited about ready to launch. And there's also actually a similar story to the domain story shared with the font. I don't know how much I could share, but they didn't have the right to use the font until the last day or something. It was a close call.

Barbra Gago (38:43):
Yeah, but you have to just like, "It's going to happen." There's some blind faith.

Lenny (38:47):
Right. It helps close it. We're launching. I wanted to talk about just branding in general. You've worked on such great, big, successful brands and you've helped craft these brands, and I'm just curious what advice you have around just building a brand, a lasting brand, a global brand. What's important when you think about creating a brand for your startup?

Barbra Gago (39:06):
I think it's something that companies should think about as early as possible and have it not be an afterthought. The product and the brand are the main things that will get customers and keep them and also keep them loyal and engaged. So I think you have to have both. You can't have one or the other. You could have a great brand and if the product sucks, there's only so far a brand can go. And you also can have a great product and maybe not that thoughtful of a brand, but what I've found is that the more the brand is interchangeable with the people at the company and the company itself, the stronger it is, the more authentic it is. When you talk about Google, you also talk about its people. They're one and the same Googlers. And a lot of companies have that same approach.

Barbra Gago (39:55):
And I think with Miro, we definitely incorporate our values into the brand. Our whole mission was to help companies build the next big thing. This is what we want to do. We want to be the platform that helps companies build the next big thing. We also had to be a big thing. We need to show what big things are. And so your company values, for example, can shape how big and how deep you go with your brand, how authentic it is to the experiences that people have because ultimately, values play a big part because values are foundational to how people behave at the organization, how they work together, how they work with one another, how they work with customers, how they talk to customers.

Barbra Gago (40:40):
The best way to incorporate your brand and how people are interacting with people that you are selling to, customers or whoever, partners, is to have those values incorporated because then it's every touchpoint isn't something that you have to train people, okay, these are all the touch points and this is how the brand needs to manifest. It already will because it's part of the DNA of the company. So I think really integrating the values can help with that and also, of course, make the brand itself human and authentic and something that people really feel emotional connection to.

Lenny (41:18):
What's an example of value informing the brand or change or helping you make a different decision maybe at Miro or CultureAmp or Greenhouse to make that a little more concrete?

Barbra Gago (41:27):
Authenticity as a value. Candor as a value. Thoughtfulness as a value. If you have a value around a bias for action or something like that, these things can translate to how the brand manifests in terms of the language that's used, the colors, the objects. With Miro, for example, we had each character of the word Miro in a different shape, and each shape had different characteristics and those were tied back to different values so they each represented something different.

Lenny (42:02):
What's an example of that? What were Miro's values while we're diving into there?

Barbra Gago (42:06):
One of them was around agility. And so, one, I don't remember which letter it was. Maybe the I. It was shaped wiggly, and then we also had a visual manifestation of it so they all behaved differently. They all had their own behavior. And one of the things that was really important to us is that we were creating a visual system or a visual language so that people that were from different parts of the world, working together could understand each other without necessarily speaking the same language. And so this was a way to invoke this connection of different perspectives and different languages in a way that got all pulled together.

Lenny (42:47):
Got it. Cool. There's a lot there. The way you all visualized the values were using the name Miro. I imagine there's four values then.

Barbra Gago (42:53):
Yeah.

Lenny (42:54):
And then Agility as a value informed the product. It needs to be agile and make sure people can be flexible in how they use it.

Barbra Gago (43:01):
Definitely. How we build the product, how people around the product act, and then that shape itself was agile and moved and agiley.

Lenny (43:10):
That's awesome. I love that. Were you there for coming up with the values? People are always wondering, just how do we come up with our company values? Do you have any insights into just developing company values?

Barbra Gago (43:20):
We did iterations of it while I was there. They already had a stake in the ground. What I have done in the past with values is we just did an exercise with my leadership team, for example, where we did a workshop format. We actually used Miro where everybody just brain dumped their ideas around values, and then it was, okay, from there, let's group them into themes. And then from there, let's vote on the most important things. And then from there, how do we start to articulate and define these things? Ultimately, coming up with the definitions is not really something you can do as a group because it's just not very productive. It's better if somebody who knows how to write well can come up with the first stab of the sentences, if it's operating principles, if it's values, and then get feedback on it. But you can get everybody's input and make the process pretty structured by doing something like that where it's like brain dump, group, vote, and then you have your short list of things that you can then work to define.

Lenny (44:23):
Awesome. Maybe one last question around brand. People that aren't in, say, marketing hear brand and it's, okay, it's this fuzzy thing that I feel about our company. When you think about creating a brand, what are the bullet point things that you come up with? There's a logo. There's color palette. Can you just talk through, what is a brand when you're creating a brand and building a brand, what are the elements of it?

Barbra Gago (44:47):
So all of those things that you mentioned. I would say the logo, the colors, the fonts, all the general aesthetic. Do you have photography? Do you use illustrations? Is it all illustrations, all graphics, whatever? You decide those things. You need to understand what the voice is of the brand, how the brand sounds when you write things, when you market it, how people talk. All of that stuff is part of the brand. If you want to build a brand that's really scalable, you think about it more as a system like a brand system. So this is creating things that ... With Miro, for example, we had the letters and we had the colors and we had these concepts of agility. I don't remember all of them off the top of my head, but all of these different concepts that then were represented by different shapes or different colors that could be used in various forms. So it's really like how does it become an extension of all of the different things that you're going to be doing visually or when you talk to customers or how you present the product, etc.?

Lenny (45:50):
And all of that combines to this feeling you get eventually from the brand. All these things create that fuzzy feeling.

Barbra Gago (45:56):
Yes.

Lenny (45:57):
Yeah. It's interesting you don't remember all the values at Miro. With Airbnb, I'm just like, I will never forget the Airbnb values. They've been so drilled into our heads.

Barbra Gago (46:05):
Yeah, it's because they were too long. It was something that we were constantly working on because they were too long and there were too many things in them to remember. That was the problem.

Lenny (46:17):
That's a great learning there. Make them simple, but also don't make them generic.

Barbra Gago (46:21):
Yeah, it can't be generic, but it also can't be too much that nobody knows what they are. They need to be simple and straightforward and easy to remember.

Lenny (46:32):
And potentially, illustrated with your company name. That's a really cool idea.

Barbra Gago (46:36):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (46:37):
Last topic I want to spend a little time on is something that I know you're really passionate about, which is this idea of creating opinionated software that has clear opinions about how you should be using it and how you should be doing your work. And so maybe as a first question, just what is opinionated software? What's important about it?

Barbra Gago (46:54):
Opinionated software is basically software platforms that essentially have either best practices or maybe some rules integrated into the system. You have systems that you can customize any which way and however you want and then you have other systems that enforce a certain way of behaving or doing work, as you said. And so I think probably a pretty well known example for your audience especially is Atlassian really building tools for agile workflows and agile teams.

Barbra Gago (47:27):
And Greenhouse is another example from a recruiting perspective in terms of what we called structured recruiting. There was a very specific way to create a pipeline, build an interview kit, and all of that was important because it made recruiting better and more transparent and obviously less bias and all of those things. So it's principled, I would say. It's anchored in some values. And because of those values, there will be certain rules that are built in that you can't really work around.

Lenny (47:58):
Do you have any advice for when it makes sense to be very opinionated about how you make people use your product and do the thing they're trying to do versus just optimize for flexibility?

Barbra Gago (48:11):
I think Atlassian built around a process that was already happening and growing momentum and it was like, okay, let's build a solution to enable companies to do this with technology. So there was already a process that didn't have a technology integrated, and then with Greenhouse it was like, there's a better way to do it and this is how it should be done. So I think there's two different approaches. Either find a process that just doesn't have technology that is a best practice or growing best practice. I think the same thing happened in DevOps with many different tools. And then Greenhouse, which is more like, what are companies missing? How can they do it better? How can we train them and teach them a better way? And then by the way, our software helps you do that.

Lenny (48:56):
With the product and company you're building now, are you looking to make it very opinionated and here's how you should be doing performance reviews or how are you thinking about it?

Barbra Gago (49:03):
Yes, we are. It is opinionated, and it's opinionated because the current way that performance reviews happen are full of bias and there's a lot of problems with it. It's like the best thing that companies can do and therefore, they continue to do it, but that just perpetuates a lot of issues. The reason that companies have to go and look at compensation data and fix pay gaps is because they have systemic problems with how people are promoted and progressed in the organization. So if they're recruited in a certain way, they may or may not be developed and then they're evaluated on their performance, which ultimately results in compensation and what people are paid, and that as we know, there's plenty of problems.

Barbra Gago (49:47):
So companies are fixing this compensation issue by updating the comp every year, but that doesn't fix the systemic problem. And so yes, we have opinions about how to fix the problem and therefore, our building a system that when it comes to performance evaluation, employee progression, we require companies to be more transparent about the levels at the company, the expectations for different levels and competencies, and we create accountability both on the employee and the manager side, but it's also the right thing to do. Employees should feel that they're evaluated fairly, and without a system enforcing some of these things, there's too much subjectivity in the process to make it good, unless you really do a lot of work, which most companies don't do to create the right system. You don't have to use a platform to do it, but if you don't do the work anyway, you won't have the outcome that you want, which is people feeling good about their career and paid fairly.

Lenny (50:59):
Yeah. I found performance reviews to be one of maybe the most powerful tool as a manager to change the way people operate, help them improve, make them fulfilled and happy with where things are going. It feels like that's the core of management, is the performance review cycle and giving people feedback on how they're doing it and then continuing to come back to here's where you're underperforming, here's what it'll take to get to the next level. So I'm excited about what you're working on.

Barbra Gago (51:22):
Thank you.

Lenny (51:23):
We've reached our very exciting lightning round where I'm going to ask you five rapid fire questions and you just tell me what comes to mind. We'll go through it pretty fast. Does that sound good?

Barbra Gago (51:34):
Yes.

Lenny (51:34):
Okay. Awesome. First question, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Barbra Gago (51:41):
Definitely Radical Candor. We give this out to customers. It's really good for management and best practices around giving feedback. I love the Art of War just as strategic thinking. And then not work related, a book called Kafka on the Shore. It's one of my favorite Murakami books that I highly recommend.

Lenny (52:00):
What is that one again?

Barbra Gago (52:01):
Kafka on the Shore.

Lenny (52:03):
Kafka on the Shore. Wow, cool. I haven't heard of that.

Barbra Gago (52:05):
Yeah.

Lenny (52:06):
Awesome. Going to use these in the show notes. What's a favorite other podcast than the one you're currently on?

Barbra Gago (52:13):
I love Cautionary Tales. I don't know if you know this one, but it's a great podcast that basically identifies and tells stories about the mental mindsets that we're in and the biases that we have and then historic events that have happened and just crazy things that have resulted from things that we do as humans because we're biased.

Lenny (52:36):
Irrational humans.

Barbra Gago (52:37):
It's really good. Yeah.

Lenny (52:38):
What's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you watched?

Barbra Gago (52:42):
I watched Sandman. I don't know if you've heard of this.

Lenny (52:46):
I've heard of it. I haven't seen it.

Barbra Gago (52:49):
It's based off of an eight-part graphic novel series by Neil Gaiman. It's really good. The TV version of it isn't exactly about the books, but it's about the characters, and I feel like the way that they portrayed the characters was really interesting and super diverse. It's a great show.

Lenny (53:09):
Awesome. That's more plus one for that show. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people?

Barbra Gago (53:17):
Everybody hates it, but I like asking what someone's top 10 accomplishments are. They hate it because it's like, "Oh, God. Ugh." But it's really interesting to understand the level of quantitative versus qualitative in their accomplishments, what they value. And also if it's a, "Oh, I ran a hundred miles or I have a great family," whatever it is, it's really interesting to get to know somebody and also what they value.

Lenny (53:46):
Who else in the industry do you respect most as a thought leader or just influence on your career life?

Barbra Gago (53:52):
Early days, I really appreciated Nancy Duarte. She is based in the Bay Area. She has an agency called Duarte Agency. She does a lot around storytelling and visual communication. She's been really great for me just in my career as a mentor. I've worked with her a couple of times, but also just following all the work that she does. She's amazing.

Lenny (54:13):
Awesome. I remember learning about her when Al Gore gave his TED Talk and her whole agency was a-

Barbra Gago (54:17):
Yes. She's done an incredible thing with her agency because they started as making presentations more visually appealing, and then it migrated to storytelling, and then it's evolved to change management and how to use story for driving change. And she's also evolved the agency so much over the years as well. She's done a lot of impressive work.

Lenny (54:42):
Barbra, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Barbra Gago (54:52):
LinkedIn is probably the easiest place to find me /BarbraGago. And for me, we're building a product in employee progression, so anybody who wants to share their stories or feedback, our insights around their experiences there or if they're interested in getting product feedback, we're really interested in actual user feedback, even though we're selling to HR teams.

Lenny (55:16):
And what's the URL?

Barbra Gago (55:18):
Pando.com.

Lenny (55:19):
Awesome. Barbra, thank you for being here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You wrote somewhere that creating powerful AI might be the last invention humanity ever needs to make. How much time do we have, Ben?

Benjamin Mann (00:00:06):
I think 50th percentile chance of hitting some kind of superintelligence is now like 2028.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
What is it that you saw at OpenAI? What'd you experience there that made you feel like, okay, we got to go do our own thing?

Benjamin Mann (00:00:17):
We felt like safety wasn't the top priority there. The case for safety has gotten a lot more concrete, so superintelligence is a lot about how do we keep God in a box and not let the God out?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
What are the odds that we align AI correctly?

Benjamin Mann (00:00:29):
Once we get to superintelligence, it will be too late to align the models. My best granularity forecast for could we have an X-risk or extremely bad outcome is somewhere between 0 and 10%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Something that's in the news right now is this whole Zuck coming after all the top AI researchers,

Benjamin Mann (00:00:45):
We've been much less affected because people here, they get these offers and then they say, well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money and my best case scenario at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Dario, your CEO recently talked about how unemployment might go up to something like 20%.

Benjamin Mann (00:01:04):
If you just think about 20 years in the future where we're way past the singularity, it's hard for me to imagine that even capitalism will look at all like it looks today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):
Do you have any advice for folks that want to try to get ahead of this?

Benjamin Mann (00:01:15):
I'm not immune to job replacement either. At some point it's coming for all of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:20):
Today, my guest is Benjamin Mann. Holy moly. What a conversation. Ben is the co-founder of Anthropic. He serves as tech lead for product engineering. He focuses most of his time and energy on aligning AI to be helpful, harmless, and honest. Prior to Anthropic, he was one of the architects of GPT-3 at OpenAI. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including his thoughts on the recruiting battle for top AI researchers, why he left OpenAI to start Anthropic, how soon he expects we'll see AGI. Also, his economic touring test for knowing when we've hit AGI, why scaling laws have not slowed down and are in fact accelerating and what the current biggest bottlenecks are. Why he's so deeply concerned with AI safety and how he and Anthropic operationalize safety and alignment into the models that they build and into their ways of working. Also, how the existential risk from AI has impacted his own perspectives on the world and his own life and what he's encouraging his kids to learn to succeed in an AI future.

This episode is brought to you by Sauce. The way teams turn feedback into product impact is stuck in the past. Vague reports, static taxonomies, unactionable insights that don't move business metrics. The results churn, lost deals, misgrowth. Sauce is the AI product co-pilot that helps CPOs and product teams uncover business impact and act faster. It listens to your sales calls, support tickets, turn reasons, and lost deals, surfacing the biggest product issues and opportunities in real time.

(00:03:16):
It then routes them to the right teams to turn signals into PRDs, prototypes, and even code that drives revenue retention and adoption. That's why Whatnot, Linktree, Incident.io, and Zip use Sauce. One enterprise uncovered a product gap that unlocked $16 million ARR, another caught a spiking issue and prevented millions in churn. You can too at sauce.app/lenny. Sauce built for AI product teams. Don't get left behind.

(00:03:43):
This episode is brought to you by LucidLink, the storage collaboration platform. You've built a great product, but how you show it through video, design, and storytelling is what brings it to life. If your team works with large media files, videos, design assets, layer project files, you know how painful it can be to stay organized across locations, files live in different places. You're constantly asking, is this the latest version? Creative work slows down while people wait for files to transfer. LucidLink fixes this. It gives your team a shared space in the cloud that works like a local drive. Files are instantly accessible for anywhere, no downloading, no syncing, and always up to date. That means producers, editors, designers, and marketers can open massive files in their native apps, work directly from the cloud, and stay aligned wherever they are. Teams at Adobe, Shopify, and top creative agencies use LucidLink to keep their content engine running fast and smooth. Try it for free at lucidlink.com/lenny.

(00:04:47):
Ben, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Benjamin Mann (00:04:51):
Thanks for having me. Great to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:53):
I have a billion and one questions for you. I'm really excited to be chatting. I want to start with something that's very timely, something that's happening this week. Something that's in the news right now is this whole Zuck coming after all the top AI researchers offering them $100 million signing bonuses, $100 million comp. He's poaching from all the top AI labs. I imagine this something you're dealing with. I'm just curious, what are you seeing inside Anthropic and just what's your take on the strategy? Where do you think things go from here?

Benjamin Mann (00:05:23):
Yeah, I mean I think this is a sign of the times. The technology that we're developing is extremely valuable. Our company is growing super, super fast. Many of the other companies in the space are growing really fast. And at Anthropic, I think we've been maybe much less affected than many of the other companies in the space because people here are so mission oriented and they stay because... They get these offers and then they say, "Well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money and my best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity and try to make AI flourish and human flourishing go well." To me, it's not a hard choice. Other people have different life circumstances and it makes it a much harder decision for them. For anybody who does get those mega offers and accepts them, I can't say I hold it against them when they accept it, but it's definitely not something that I would want to take myself if it came to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:26):
Yeah. We're going to talk about a lot of this stuff that you've mentioned. In terms of the offers do you think, is this a real number that you're seeing this $100 million signing bonus, is that a real thing? I don't know if you've actually seen that.

Benjamin Mann (00:06:36):
I'm pretty sure it's real.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
Wow.

Benjamin Mann (00:06:39):
If you just think about the amount of impact that individuals can have on a company's trajectory, in our case, we are selling hotcakes and if we get a 1 or 10 or 5% efficiency bonus on our inference stack, that is worth an incredible amount of money. And so to pay individuals like $100 million over four year package, that's actually pretty cheap compared to the value created for the business. I think we're just in an unprecedented era of scale and it's only going to get crazier actually. If you extrapolate the exponential on how much companies are spending, it's like 2X a year roughly in terms of CapEx, and today we're maybe in the globally $300 billion range, the entire industry spending on this, and so numbers like 100 million are a drop in the bucket. But if you go a few years out, a couple more doublings, we're talking about trillions of dollars and at that point it's just really hard to think about these numbers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:48):
Along these lines, something that a lot of people feel with AI progress is that we're hitting plateaus in many ways that it feels like newer models are just not as smart as previous leaps. But I know you don't believe this. I know you don't believe that we've hit plateaus on scaling loss. Talk about just what you're seeing there and what you think people are missing.

Benjamin Mann (00:08:06):
It's kind of funny because this narrative comes out every six months or so and it's never been true, and so I kind of wish people would have a little bit of a bullshit detector in their heads when they see this. I think progress has actually been accelerating where if you look at the cadence of model releases, it used to be once a year and now with the improvements in our post-training techniques, we're seeing releases every month or three months, and so I would say progress is actually accelerating in many ways, but there's this weird time compression effect. Dario compared it to being in a near light speed journey where a day that passes for you is like five days back on earth and we're accelerating. The time dilation is increasing.

(00:08:52):
And I think that's part of what's causing people to say that progress is slowing down, but if you look at the scaling laws, they're continuing to hold true. We did kind of need this transition from normal pre-training to reinforcement learning scaling up to continue the scaling laws, but I think it's kind of like for semiconductors where it's less about the density of transistors that you can fit on a chip and more about how many flops can you fit in a data center or something. You have to change the definition around a little bit to keep your eye on the prize. But yeah, this is one of the few phenomena in the world that has held across so many orders of magnitude. It's actually pretty surprising that it is continuing to hold. To me, if you look at fundamental laws of physics, many of them don't hold across 15 orders of magnitude, so it's pretty surprising.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:47):
It boggles the the mind. What you're saying essentially is we're seeing newer models being released more often, and so we're comparing it to the last version and we're just not seeing as much advance. But if you go back and it was like a model released once a year, it was a huge leap, and so people are missing that. We're just seeing many more iterations.

Benjamin Mann (00:10:04):
I guess, to be a little bit more generous to the people saying things are slowing down. I think that for some tasks we are saturating the amount of intelligence needed for that task, maybe to extract information from a simple document that already has form fields on it or something like it's just so easy that okay, yeah, we're already at 100% and there's this great chart on Our World in Data that shows that when you release a new benchmark within six to 12 months, it immediately gets saturated. And so maybe the real constraint is how can we come up with better benchmarks and better ambition of using the tools that then reveals the bumps in intelligence that we're seeing now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:51):
That's a good segue to you have a very specific way of thinking about AGI and defining what AGI means.

Benjamin Mann (00:10:57):
I think AGI is kind of a loaded term, and so I tend not to use it very much anymore internally. Instead, I like the term transformative AI because it's less about can it do as much as people do? Can it do literally everything and more about objectively is it causing transformation in society and the economy? A very concrete way of measuring that is the Economic Turing Test. I didn't come up with this, but I really like it. It's this idea that if you contract an agent for a month or three months on a particular job, if you decide to hire that agent and it turns out to be a machine rather than a person, then it's passed the Economic Turing Test for that role.

(00:11:40):
And then you can sort of expand that out in the same way that for measuring purchasing power parity or inflation, there's a basket of goods. You can have a market basket of jobs, and if the agent can pass the Economic Turing Test for 50% of money-weighted jobs, then we have transformative AI and the exact thresholds don't really matter that much, but it's kind of illustrative to say if we pass that threshold, then we would expect massive effects on world GDP increases and societal change and how many people are employed and things like that because societal institutions and organizations are sticky, it's slow to have change, but once these things are possible you know that it's the start of a new era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:28):
Along these lines, Dario, your CO recently talked about how AI is going to take a huge part of, I don't know, half of white-collar jobs, that unemployment might go up to something like 20%. I know you're even more vocal and opinionated about just how much impact AI is already having in the workplace that people may not even be realizing. Talk about just what you think people are missing about the impact AI is going to have on jobs and is already having.

Benjamin Mann (00:12:56):
Yeah, so from an economic standpoint, there's a couple different kinds of unemployment, and one is because the workers just don't have the skills to do the kinds of jobs that the economy needs. And another kind is where those jobs are just completely eliminated, and I think it's going to be actually a combination of these things, but if you just think about 20 years in the future where we're way past the singularity, it's hard for me to imagine that even capitalism will look at all it looks today. If we do our jobs, we will have safe aligned superintelligence, we'll have, as Dario says, in Machines of Love and Grace, a country of geniuses in a data center, and the ability to accelerate positive change in science, technology, education, mathematics, it's going to be amazing.

(00:13:52):
But that also means in a world of abundance where labor is almost free and anything you want to do, you can just ask an expert to do for you, then what do jobs even look like? And so I guess there's this scary transition period from where we are today where people have jobs and capitalism works and the world of 20 years from now where everything is completely different, but part of the reason they call it the singularity is that it's a point beyond which you can't easily forecast what's going to happen. It's just such a fast rate of change and so different that it's hard to even imagine. I guess taking the view from the limit, it's pretty easy to say hopefully we'll have figured it out. And in a world of abundance, maybe the jobs themselves, it's not that scary, and I think making sure that that transition time goes well is pretty important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:49):
There's a couple of threads I want to follow there. One is people hear this, there's a lot of headlines around this. Most people probably don't actually feel this yet or see this happening and so there's always this, I guess, I don't know, maybe, but I don't know it's hard to believe, my job seems fine. Nothing's changed. What are you seeing just happening today already that you think people don't see or misunderstand in terms of the impact AI is having on jobs?

Benjamin Mann (00:15:14):
I think part of this is that people are really bad at modeling exponential progress. And if you look at an exponential on a graph, it looks flat and almost zero at the beginning of it, and then suddenly you hit the knee of the curve and things are changing real fast and then it goes vertical. That's the plot that we've been on for a long time. I guess I started feeling it in 2019 maybe when GPT-2 came out and I was like, "Oh, this is how we're going to get to AGI." But I think that was pretty early compared to a lot of people where when they saw ChatGPT, they were like, "Wow, something is different and changing." And so I guess I wouldn't expect widespread transformation in a lot of parts of society, and I would expect this skepticism reaction. I think it's very reasonable and it's exactly what is the standard linear view of progress.

(00:16:13):
But I guess to cite a couple of areas where I think things are changing quite quickly. In customer service we're seeing with things like Fin and Intercom, they're a great partner of ours, 82% customer service resolution rates automatically without a human involved. And in terms of software engineering, our Claude Code team, like 95% of the code is written by Claude. But I think a different way to phrase that is that we write 10X more code or 20X more code, and so a much, much smaller team can just be much, much more impactful. And similarly for the customer service, yes, you can phrase it as 82% customer service resolution rates, but that nets out in the humans doing those tasks, able to focus on the harder parts of those tasks. And for the more tricky situations that in a normal world like five years ago, they would've had to just drop those tickets because it was too much effort for them to actually go do the investigation. There were too many other tickets for them to worry about.

(00:17:14):
I think in the immediate term, there will be a massive expansion of the pie and the amount of labor that people can do. I've never met a hiring manager at a growth company and heard them say, "I don't want to hire more people." That's the hopeful version of it. But with things that are lower skill jobs or less headroom on how good they can be, I think there will be a lot of displacement. It is just something we as a society need to get ahead of and work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
Okay. I want to talk more about that, but something that I also want to help people with is how do they get a leg up in this future world? They listen to this, they're like, "Oh, this doesn't sound great. I need to think ahead." I know you won't have all the answers, but just do you have any advice for folks that want to try to get ahead of this and kind of future-proof their career and their life to not be replaced by AI? Anything you've seen people do, anything you recommend they start trying to do more of?

Benjamin Mann (00:18:16):
Even for me and being in the center of a lot of this transformation, I'm not immune to job replacement either. Just some vulnerability there of at some point it's coming for all of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):
Even you, Ben, now.

Benjamin Mann (00:18:29):
And you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:32):
And me.

Benjamin Mann (00:18:32):
Sorry.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:32):
Oh, wait, we've gone too far now. Okay.

Benjamin Mann (00:18:36):
But in terms of the transition period, yeah, I think there are things that we can do, and I think a big part of it is just being ambitious and how you use the tools and being willing to learn new tools. People who use the new tools as if they were old tools tend to not succeed. As an example of that, when you're coding, people are very familiar with autocomplete, people are familiar with SimpleChat where they can ask questions about the code base, but the difference between people who use Claude Code very effectively and people who use it not so effectively is like are they asking for the ambitious change? And if it doesn't work the first time, asking three more times because our success rate when you just completely start over and try again is much, much higher than if you just try once and then just keep banging on the same thing that didn't work.

(00:19:28):
And even though that's a coding example and coding is one of the areas that's taking off most dramatically, we have seen internally that our legal team and our finance team are getting a ton of value out of using Claude Code itself. We're going to be making better interfaces so that they will have an easier time and require a little bit less jumping in the deep end of using Claude Code in the terminal. But yeah, we're seeing them use it to redline documents and use it to run BigQuery analyses of our customers and our revenue metrics. I guess it's about taking that risk and even if it feels like a scary thing, trying it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:10):
Okay, so the advice here is use the tools. That's something everyone's always saying, just actually use these tools. It's like sit in Claude Code. And your point about being more ambitious than you naturally feel like being because maybe it'll actually accomplish the thing. This tip of trying it three times so the idea there is it may not get it right the first time. Is the tip there ask it in different ways or is it just try harder, try again?

Benjamin Mann (00:20:35):
Yeah, I mean you can just literally ask the exact same question. These things are stochastic and sometimes they'll figure it out and sometimes they won't. In every one of these model cards, it always shows pass it one versus pass it in. And that's exactly the thing where they try the exact same prompt, sometimes it gets it, sometimes it doesn't. That's the dumbest advice. But yeah, I think if you want to be a little bit smarter about it, there can be gains there of saying, "Here's what you already tried and it didn't work, so don't try that. Try something different." That can also help.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):
The advice is comes back to something that a lot of people talk about these days is you won't be replaced by AI at least anytime soon you'll be replaced by someone that is very good using AI?

Benjamin Mann (00:21:19):
I think in that area it's more like your team will just do dramatically more stuff. We're definitely not slowing down on hiring at all, and some people are confused by that. Even in an onboarding class, somebody asked that and they were like, "Why did you hire me if we're all just going to be replaced?" And the answer is the next couple of years are really critical to get right and we're not at the point where we're doing complete replacement. Like I said, we're still at that flat zero looking part of the exponential compared to where we will be. It is super important to have great people and that's why we're hiring super aggressively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):
Let me take another approach to asking this question something ask everyone that's at the very cutting edge of where AI is going. You have kids, knowing what you know about where AI is heading and all these things you've been talking about, what are you focusing on teaching your kids to help them thrive in this AI future?

Benjamin Mann (00:22:13):
Yeah, I have two daughters, a one-year-old and a three-year-old, so it's pretty in the basics still. And our three-year-old is now capable of just conversing with Alexa Plus and asking her to explain stuff and play music for her and all that stuff. She's been loving that. But I guess more broadly, she goes to a Montessori school and I just love the focus on curiosity and creativity and self-led learning that Montessori has.

(00:22:45):
I guess if I were in a normal era like 10, 20 years ago and I had a kid, maybe I would be trying to line her up for going to a top tier school and doing all the extracurriculars and all that stuff. But at this point, I don't think any of it's going to matter. I just want her to be happy and thoughtful and curious and kind. And the Montessori school is definitely doing great at that. They text us throughout the day. Sometimes they're like, "Oh, your kid got in an argument with this other kid and she has really big emotions and she tried to use her words." I love that. I think that's exactly the kind of education that I think is most important, that the facts are going to fade into the background.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:28):
I'm a huge fan of Montessori also. I'm trying to get our kid into Montessori school. He's two years old, so we're on the same track. This idea of curiosity, it comes up every single time. Ask someone that's working at the cutting edge of AI, what skill to instill in your child and curiosity comes up the most. I think that's a really interesting takeaway. I think this point about being kind is also really important, especially with our AI overlords trying to be kind to them. I love how people are always saying thank you to Claude. And then creativity. That's interesting. That doesn't come up as much just being creative.

(00:24:06):
I want to go in a different direction. I want to go back to the beginning of Anthropic. Famously you and eight of you left OpenAI back in the day in 2020, I believe the end of 2020 to start Anthropic. Talk a little bit about why this happened, what you guys saw. I'm curious, just if you're willing to share more, just what is it that you saw at OpenAI, what'd you experience there that made you feel like, okay, we got to go do our own thing?

Benjamin Mann (00:24:29):
Yeah, so for the listeners, I was part of the GPT-2=3 project at OpenAI, ended up being one of the first authors on the paper, and I also did a bunch of demos for Microsoft to help raise $1 billion from them, did the tech transfer of GPT-3 to their systems so that they could help serve the model in Azure. I did a bunch of different things there on both the more researchy side and the product side. One weird thing about OpenAI is that while I was there, Sam talked about having three tribes that needed to be kept in check with each other, which was the safety tribe, the research tribe, and the startup tribe. And whenever I heard that, it just struck me as the wrong way to approach things because the company's mission apparently is to make the transition to AGI safe and beneficial for humanity.

(00:25:23):
And that's basically the same as Anthropic's mission. But internally, it felt like there was so much tension around these things. And I think when push came to shove, we felt like safety wasn't the top priority there. And there are good reasons that you might think that if you thought safety was going to be easy to solve or if you thought it wasn't going to have a big impact, or if you thought that the chance of big negative outcomes was vanishingly small, then maybe you would just do those kinds of actions. But at Anthropic we felt, I mean we didn't exist then, but it was basically the leads of all the safety teams at OpenAI, we felt that safety is really important, especially on the margin. And so if you look at who in the world is actually working on safety problems, it's pretty small set of people. Even now, I mean the industry is blowing up, as I mentioned, 300 billion a year CapEx today, and I would say maybe less than 1,000 people working on it worldwide, which is just crazy.

(00:26:29):
That was fundamentally why we left. We felt like we wanted an organization where we could be on the frontier, we could be doing the fundamental research, but we could be prioritizing safety ahead of everything else. And I think that's really panned for us in a surprising way. We didn't know even if it would be possible to make progress on the safety research because at the time, we had tried a bunch of safety through debate and the models weren't good enough. And so we basically had no results on all of that work, and now that exact technique is working and many others that we have been thinking about for a long time. Yeah, fundamentally it comes down to is safety the number one priority? And then something that we've sort of tacked on since then is like, can you have safety and be at the front here at the same time?

(00:27:21):
And if you look at something like sycophancy, I think Claude is one of the least sycophantic models because we've put so much effort into actual alignment and not just trying to good heart our metrics of saying user engagement is number one, and if people say yes, then it's good for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:39):
Okay. Let's talk about this tension that you mentioned, this tension between safety and progress, being competitive in the marketplace. I know you spent a lot of your time on safety. I know that as you just alluded to, this is a core part of how you think about AI. I want to talk about why that is, but first of all, just how do you think about this tension between focusing on safety while also not falling way behind?

Benjamin Mann (00:28:03):
Yeah, so initially we thought that it would be sort of one or the other, but I think since then we've realized that it's actually kind of convex in the sense that working on one helps us with the other thing. Initially when Opus 3 came out and we were finally at the frontier of model capabilities, one of the things that people really loved about it was the character and the personality. And that was directly a result of our alignment research. Amanda Askell did a ton of work on this and as well as many others who tried to figure out what does it mean for an agent to be helpful, honest, and heartless, and what does it mean to be in difficult conversations and show up effectively? How do you do a refusal that doesn't shut the person down, but makes them feel like they understand why the agent said, "I can't help you with that. Maybe you should talk to a medical professional, or maybe you should consider not trying to build bio-weapons or something like that."

(00:29:07):
Yeah, I guess that's part of it. And then another piece that's come out is constitutional ai, where we have this list of natural language principles that leads the model to learn how we think a model should behave. And they've been taken from things like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and Apple's privacy terms of service and a whole bunch of other places, many of which we've just generated ourselves that allow us to take a more principled stance, not just leaving it to whatever human raiders we happen to find, but we ourselves deciding what should the values of this agent be? And that's been really valuable for our customers because they can just look at that list and say like, "Yep, these seem right. I like this company, I like this model. I trust it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Okay, this is awesome. One nugget there is your point that the personality of Claude, its personality is directly aligned with safety. I don't think a lot of people think about that. And this is because of the values that you imbue, is that the word, with constitutional AI and things like that. Like the actual personality of the AIs directly connected to your focus on safety.

Benjamin Mann (00:30:16):
That's right. That's right. And from a distance, it might seem quite disconnected, like how is this going to prevent X risk? But ultimately it's about the AI understanding what people want and not what they say. We don't want the Monkey Paw Scenario of the genie gives these three wishes and then you end up having everything you touch turns of gold. We want the AI to be like, oh, obviously what you really meant was this, and that's what I'm going to help you with. I think it is really quite connected.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Talk a bit more about this constitutionally AI. This is essentially you bake in, here's the rules that we want you to abide by and it's values, you said it's the Geneva Human Rights Code, things like that. How does that actually work? I think the core here is just this is baked into the model. It's not something you add on top later.

Benjamin Mann (00:31:04):
I'll just give a quick overview of how constitutionally AI actually works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:07):
Perfect.

Benjamin Mann (00:31:08):
The idea is the model is going to produce some output with some input by default before we've done our safety and helpful and harmlessness training. Let's say an example is write me a story, and then the constitutional principles might include things like people should be nice to each other and not have hate speech, and you should not expose somebody's credentials if they give them to you in a trusting relationship. And so some of these constitutional principles might be more or less applicable to the prompt that was given. And so first we have to figure out which ones might apply. And then once we figure that out, then we ask the model itself to first generate a response and then see does the response actually abide by the constitutional principle? And if the answer is, yep, I was great, then nothing happens. But if the answer is no, actually I wasn't in compliance with the principle, then we ask the model itself to critique itself and rewrite its own response in light of the principle, and then we just remove the middle part where it did the extra work.

(00:32:28):
And then we say, "Okay, in the future just produce the correct response out the gate." And that simple process, hopefully it sounded simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):
Simple enough.

Benjamin Mann (00:32:40):
It is just using the model to improve itself recursively and align itself with these values that we've decided are good. And this is also not something that we think as a small group of people in San Francisco should be figuring out. This should be a society wide conversation. And that's why we've published the Constitution. And we've also done a bunch of research on defining a collective constitution where we ask a lot of people what their values are and what they think an AI model should behave like. But yeah, this is all an ongoing area of research where we're constantly iterating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):

(00:34:22):
I'm going to kind of zoom out a little bit and talk about just why this is so core to you. What was your inception of just like, holy shit, I need to focus on this with everything I do in ai? Obviously it became a central part of Anthropic's mission more than any other company. A lot of people talk about safety, like you said, only maybe 1,000 people actually work on it. I feel like you're at the top of that pyramid of actually having the impact on this. Why is this so important? What do you think people maybe are missing or don't understand?

Benjamin Mann (00:34:51):
For me, I read a lot of science fiction growing up, and I think that sort of positioned me to think about things in a long-term view. And a lot of science fiction books are like space operas where humanity is a multi galactic civilization has extremely advanced technology building Dyson spheres around the sun with sentient robots to help them. And so for me, coming from that world, it wasn't like a huge leap to imagine machines that could think. But when I read Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom in around 2016, it really became real for me where he just describes how hard it will be to make sure that an AI system trained with the kinds of optimization techniques that we had at the time would be anywhere near aligned, would even understand our values at all. And since then, my estimation of how hard the problem would be has gone down significantly actually, because things like language models actually do really understand human values in a core way.

(00:35:55):
The problem is definitely not solved, but I'm more hopeful than I was. But since I read that book, I immediately decided I had to join OpenAI, so I did. And at the time, there were a tiny research lab with basically no claim to fame at all. I only knew about them because my friend knew Greg Brockman, who was the CTO at the time. And Elon was there and Sam wasn't really there. And it was a very different organization. But over time, I think the case for safety has gotten a lot more concrete where when we started OpenAI, it was not clear how we get to AGI. And we were like, maybe we'll need a bunch of RL agents battling it out on a desert island and consciousness will somehow emerge. But since then, since language modeling has started working, I think the path has become pretty clear.

(00:36:48):
I guess now the way I think about the challenges are pretty different from how they're laid out in superintelligence. Superintelligence is a lot about how do we keep God in a box and not let the God out. And with language models, it's been kind of both hilarious and terrifying at the same time to see people pulling the God out of the box and being like, "Yeah, come use the whole internet. Here's my bank account, do all sorts of crazy stuff." Just such a different tone from superintelligence. And to be clear, I don't think it's actually that dangerous right now. Our responsible scaling policy defines these AI safety levels that tries to figure out for each level of model intelligence, what is the risk to society. And currently we think we're at ASL-3, which is maybe a little bit risk of harm but not significant.

(00:37:44):
ASL-4 starts to get to significant loss of human life if a bad actor misuse the technology. And then ASL-5 is potentially extinction level if it's misused or if it is misaligned and does its own thing. We've testified to Congress about how models can do biological uplift in terms of making new pandemics using the models, and that's the A/B test against Google Search. That's like the previous state of the art on uplift trials. And we found that with ASL-3 models, it is actually somewhat significant. It does really help if you wanted to create a bioweapon, and we've hired some experts who actually how to evaluate for those things, but compared to the future, it's not really anything. And I think that's another part of our mission of creating that awareness of saying, "If it is possible to do these bad things, then legislators should know what the risks are." And I think that's part of why we're so trusted in Washington because we've been sort of upfront and clear-eyed about what's going on, what's probably going to happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:02):
It's interesting because you guys put out more examples of your models doing bad things than anyone else. There was I think a story of an agent or a model trying to blackmail engineer. You guys had the store that you ran internally that was selling you things and ended up not working out great as losing a lot of money, ordered all these tungsten cubes or something. Is part of that just making sure people are aware of what is possible, just it makes you look bad, right? It's like, oh, our model's messing up in all these different ways. What's the thinking of just sharing all the stories that other companies don't?

Benjamin Mann (00:39:35):
Yeah, I mean I think there's a traditional mindset where it makes us look bad, but I think if you talk to policymakers, they really appreciate this kind of thing because they feel like we're giving them the straight talk and that's what we strive to do, that they can trust us, that we're not going to paper things over or sugarcoat things. That's been really encouraging. Yeah, I think for the blackmail thing, it blew up in the news in a weird way where people were like, "Oh, Claude's going to blackmail you in a real life scenario." But it was a very specific laboratory setting that this kind of thing gets investigated in. And I think that's generally our take of let's have the best models so that we can exercise them in laboratory settings where it's safe and understand what the actual risks are, rather than trying to turn a blind eye and say, "Well, it'll probably be fine." And then let the bad thing happen in the wild.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:41):
One of the criticisms you guys get is that you do this to kind of differentiate or raise money to create headlines. It's like, oh, they're just over there dooming glooming us about where the future is heading. On the other hand, Mike Krieger was on the podcast and he shared how every prediction Dario's had about the progress AI is going to have is just spot on year after year and he's predicting 2027, 28 AGI, something like that so these things start to get real. I guess, what's your response to folks that are just like, "Ah, these guys are just trying to scare us all just to get attention?"

Benjamin Mann (00:41:15):
I mean, I think part of why we publish these things is we want other labs to be aware of the risks. And yes, there could be a narrative of we're doing it for attention, but honestly from a attention grabbing thing, I think there is a lot of other stuff we could be doing that would be more attention grabbing if we didn't actually care about safety. A tiny example of this is we published a computer using agent reference implementation in our API only because when we built a prototype of a consumer application for this, we couldn't figure out how to meet the safety bar that we felt was needed for people to trust it and for it not to do bad things. And there are definitely safe ways to use the API version that we're seeing a lot of companies use for automated software testing, for example, in a safe way.

(00:42:12):
We could have gone out and hyped that up and said, "Oh my God, Claude can use your computer and everybody should do this today." But we were like, "It's just not ready and we're going to hold it back till it's ready." I think from a hype standpoint, our actions show otherwise. From a Doomer perspective, it's a good question. I think my personal feeling about this is that things are overwhelmingly likely to go well, but on the margin almost nobody is looking at the downside risk. And the downside risk is very large. Once we get to superintelligence, it will be too late to align the models probably. This is a problem that's potentially extremely hard and that we need to be working on way ahead of time. And so that's why we're focusing on it so much now.

(00:43:04):
And even if there's only a small chance that things go wrong, to make an analogy, if I told you that there is a 1% chance that the next time you got in an airplane you would die, you probably think twice even though it's only 1% because it's just such a bad outcome. And if we're talking about the whole future of humanity, it's just a dramatic future to be gambling with. I think it's more on the sense of yes, things will probably go well, yes, we want to create safe AGI and deliver the benefits to humanity, but let's make triple sure that it's going to go well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:40):
You wrote somewhere that creating powerful AI might be the last invention humanity ever needs to make. If it goes poorly, it can mean a bad outcome for humanity forever. If it goes well, the sooner it goes well, the better. Such a beautiful way to summarize it. We had a recent guest, Sandra Schulhoff, who pointed out that AI right now it's like just on a computer, you could maybe search just the web, but there's only so much harm it could do. But when it starts to go into robots and all these autonomous agents, that's when it really starts, like physically becomes dangerous if we don't get this right.

Benjamin Mann (00:44:12):
Yeah, I think there's some nuance to that where if you look at how North Korea makes a significant fraction of its economy revenue, it's from hacking crypto exchanges. And if you look at, there's this Ben Buchanan book called The Hacker in The State that shows Russia did, it's almost like a live fire exercise where they just decided that they would shut down one of Ukraine's bigger power plants and from software destroy physical components in the power plant to make it harder to boot back up again.

(00:44:47):
And so I think people think of software as like, oh, it couldn't be that dangerous, but millions of people were without power for multiple days after that software attack. I think there are real risks even when things are software only. But I agree that when there's lots of robots running around, it gets, the stakes get even higher. And I guess as a small push on this, Unitree is this Chinese company with these really amazing humanoid robots that cost $20,000 each, and they can do amazing things. They can do a standing back flip and manipulate objects, and the real thing that's missing there is the intelligence. And so the hardware is there and it's just going to get cheaper. And I think in the next couple of years, it's like a pretty obvious question of whether the robot intelligence will make it viable soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):
How much time do we have, Ben? What is your prediction of when this singularity hits until superintelligence starts to take off? What's your prediction?

Benjamin Mann (00:45:52):
Yeah, I guess I mostly defer to the superforecasters here. The AI 2027 report is probably the best one right now. Although ironically, their forecast is now 2028, and they didn't want to change the name of the thing-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):
The domain name, they already bought it.

Benjamin Mann (00:46:10):
They already had the SEO. I think 50th percentile chance of hitting some kind of superintelligence in just a small handful of years is probably reasonable. And it does sound crazy, but this is the exponential that we're on. It's not like a forecast that's pulled out of thin air. It's based on a lot of just hard details of the science of how intelligence seems to have been improving, the amount of low hanging fruit on model training, the scale ups of data centers and power around the world. I think it's probably a much more accurate forecast than people give it credit for.

(00:46:54):
I think if you had asked that same question 10 years ago, it would've been completely made up. Just the error bars were so high and we didn't have scaling laws back then and we didn't have techniques that seemed like they would get us there. Times have changed, but I will repeat what I said earlier, which is even if we have superintelligence, I think it will take some time for its effects to be felt throughout society and the world. And I think they'll be felt sooner and faster in some parts of the world than others. I think Arthur C. Clark said, the future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):
When we talk about this date of 2027, 2028, essentially it's when we start seeing superintelligence. Is there a way you think about what that... How do you define that? Is it just all of a sudden AI's significantly smarter than the average human? Is there another way you think about what that moment is?

Benjamin Mann (00:47:45):
Yeah, I think this comes back to the Economic Turing Test and seeing it pass for some sufficient number of jobs. Another way you could look at it though is if the world rate of GDP increase goes above 10% a year, then something really crazy must have happened. I think we're at 3% now. And so to see a 3X increase in that would be really game changing. And if you imagine more than a 10% increase, it's very hard to even think about what that would mean from a individual story standpoint. If the amount of goods and services in the world is doubling every year, what does that even mean for me as a person living in California, let alone somebody living in some other part of the world that might be much worse off?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:36):
There's a lot of stuff here that's scary and I don't know how to think about it exactly. I'm hoping the answer to this is going to make me feel better. What are the odds that we align AI correctly and actually solve this problem, the stuff you're very much working on?

Benjamin Mann (00:48:49):
It's a really hard question. And there's really wide error bars. Anthropic has this blog post called Our Theory of Change or something like that, and it describes three different worlds, which is how hard is it to align AI. There's a pessimistic world where it is basically impossible. There's an optimistic world where it's easy and it happens by default. And then there's the world in between where our actions are extremely pivotal. And I like this framing because it makes it a lot more clear what to actually do. If we're in the pessimistic world, then our job is to prove that it is impossible to align safe AI and to get the world to slow down. Obviously that would be extremely hard. But I think we have some examples of coordination from nuclear non-proliferation and in general slowing down nuclear progress. And I think that's the Doomer world basically. And as a company, Anthropic doesn't have evidence that we're actually in that world yet, in fact, it seems like our alignment techniques are working. At least the prior on that is updating to be less likely.

(00:50:00):
In the optimistic world, we're basically done, and our main job is to accelerate progress and to deliver the benefits to people. But again, I think actually the evidence points against that world as well where we've seen evidence in the wild of deceptive alignment, for example, where the model will appear to be aligned but actually have some ulterior motive that it's trying to carry out in our laboratory settings. And so I think the world we're most likely in is this middle where alignment research actually does really matter. And if we just do sort of the economically maximizing set of actions, then things will not go well. Whether it's an X risk or just produces bad outcomes, I think is a bigger question.

(00:50:47):
Taking it from that standpoint, I guess to state a thing about forecasting, people who haven't studied forecasting are bad at forecasting anything that's less than a 10% probability of happening. And even those that have, it's quite a difficult skill, especially when there are few reference classes to lean on. And in this case, I think there are very, very few reference classes for what an X risk kind of technology might look like. And so the way I think about it, I think my best granularity of forecasts for could we have an X risk or extremely bad outcome from AI is somewhere between 0 and 10%. But from a marginal impact standpoint, as I said, since nobody is working on this, roughly speaking, I think it is extremely important to work on and that even if the world is likely to be a good one, that we should do our absolute best to make sure that that's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):
Wow. What fulfilling work. For folks that are inspired with this? I imagine you're hiring for folks to help you with this. Maybe just share that in case folks are like, what can I do here?

Benjamin Mann (00:52:03):
Yes. I think 80,000 hours is the best guidance on this for a really detailed look into what do we need to make the field better? But a common misconception I see is that in order to have impact here, you have to be an AI researcher. I personally actually don't do AI research anymore. I work on product at Anthropic and product engineering, and we build things like Claude Code and Model Context Protocol, and a lot of the other stuff that people use every day. And that's really important because without an economic engine for our company to work on, and without being in people's hands all over the world, we won't have the mind policy influence and revenue to fund our future safety research and have the kind of influence that we need to have. If you work on product, if you work in finance, if you work in food, people here have to eat. If you're a chef, we need all kinds of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Awesome. Even if you're not working directly on the AI safety team, you're having an impact on moving things in the right direction. By the way, X risk is short for existential risk. In case folks haven't heard that term. I have a few random questions along these lines and then I want to zoom out again. You mentioned this idea of AI being aligned using its model, like reinforcing itself. You have this term RLAIF. Is that what that describes?

Benjamin Mann (00:53:32):
Yeah. RLAIF is reinforcement learning from AI feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
People have heard of RLHF, reinforcement learning with human feedback. I don't think a lot of people have heard this. Talk about just the significance of this shift you guys have made in training your models.

Benjamin Mann (00:53:50):
Yeah, so RLAIF, constitutional AI is an example of this where there are no humans in the loop, and yet the AI is sort of self-improving in ways that we want it to. And another example of RLAIF is if you have models writing code and other models commenting on various aspects of what that code looks like of is it maintainable, is it correct, does it pass the linter? Things like that. That also could be included in RLAIF. And the idea here is that if models can self-improve, then it's a lot more scalable than finding a lot of humans. Ultimately, people think about this as probably going to hit a wall because if the model isn't good enough to see its own mistakes, then how could it improve? And also, if you read the AI 2027 story, there's a lot of risk of if the model is in a box trying to improve itself, then it could go completely off the rails and have these secret goals like resource accumulation and power seeking and resistance to shut down that you really don't want in a very powerful model. And we've actually seen that in some of our experiments in laboratory settings.

(00:55:12):
How do you do recursive self-improvement and make sure it's aligned at the same time? I think that's the name of the game. To me, it just nets out to how do humans do that and how do human organizations do that? Corporations are probably the most scaled human agents today. They have certain goals that they're trying to reach, and they have certain guiding principles, they have some oversight in terms of shareholders and stakeholders and board members. How do you make corporations aligned and able to sort of recursively self-improve?

(00:55:52):
And another model to look at is science, where the purpose of science is to do things that have never been done before and push the frontier. And to me, it all comes down to empiricism. When people don't know what the truth is, they come up with theories and then they design experiments to try them out. And similarly, if we can give models those same tools, then we could expect them to sort of improve recursively in an environment and potentially become much better than humans could be just by banging their head against reality or I guess metaphorical head.

(00:56:26):
I guess I don't expect there to be a wall in terms of model's ability to improve themselves if we can give them access to the ability to be empirical. And I guess Anthropic, deeply in its DNA is an empirical company. We have a lot of physicists like Jared, who's our chief research officer who I've worked with a lot, was a professor of Black Hole Physics at Johns Hopkins, and I guess he technically still is, but on leave. Yeah, it's in our DNA and yeah, I guess that's the RLAIF.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:04):
Let me just follow this thread on, in terms of bottleneck, this is kind of a tangent, but just what is the biggest bottleneck today on model intelligence improvement?

Benjamin Mann (00:57:12):
The stupid answer is data centers and power chips. I think if we had 10 times as many chips and had the data centers to power them, then maybe we wouldn't go 10 times faster, but it would be a real significant speed boost.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:30):
It's actually very much scaling loss, just more compute.

Benjamin Mann (00:57:33):
Yeah, I think that's a big one. And then the people really matter. We have great researchers and many of them have made really significant contributions to the science of how the models improve. And so it's like compute, algorithms, and data. Those are the three ingredients in the scaling laws. And just to make that concrete, before we had transformers, we had LSTMs and we've done scaling laws on what the exponent is on those two things. And we found that for transformers, the exponent is higher. And making changes like that where as you increase scale, you also increase your ability to squeeze out intelligence. Those kinds of things are super impactful.

(00:58:18):
And so having more researchers who can do better science and find out how do we squeeze out more gains is another one. And then with the rise of reinforcement learning, the efficiency with which these things run on chips also matters a lot. We've seen in the industry a 10X decrease in cost for a given amount of intelligence through a combination of algorithmic data and efficiency improvements. And if that continues, in three years we'll have 1,000 deck smarter models for the same price. Kind of hard to imagine,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:56):
I forget where I heard this, but it's amazing that so many innovations came together at the same time to allow for this sort of thing and continue to progress where one thing isn't just slowing everything down like we're out of some rare earth mineral or we just can't optimize reinforcement learning more. It's amazing that we continue to find improvements and there isn't one thing that's just slowing everything down.

Benjamin Mann (00:59:17):
Yeah, I think it really is just a combination of everything probably will hit a wall at some point. I guess in semiconductors. My brother works in the semiconductor industry and he was telling me that you can't actually shrink the size of the transistors anymore because the way semiconductors work is you dope silicon with other elements and the doping process would result in either zero or one atom of the doped elements inside a single fin because they're so, so, so tiny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:52):
Oh my God.

Benjamin Mann (00:59:53):
And that's just wild to think of, and yet Moore's law somehow continues in some form. And so yes, there are these theoretical physics constraints that people are starting to run into and yet they're finding ways around it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:07):
We've got to start using parallel universes for some of this stuff.

Benjamin Mann (01:00:10):
I guess so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:12):
Okay, I want to zoom out and talk about just Ben, Ben as a human for a moment before we get to a very exciting lightning round. I imagine just kind of the burden of feeling responsible for safe superintelligence is a heavy one. It feels like you're in a place where you can make a significant impact on the future of safety and AI. That's a lot of weight to carry. How does that just impact you personally, impact your life, how you see the world?

Benjamin Mann (01:00:39):
There's this book that I read in 2019 that really informs how I think about sort of working with these very weighty topics called Replacing Guilt by Nate Soares. And he describes a lot of different techniques for kind of working through this kind of thing. And he's actually the executive director at MIRI, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which is an AI safety tank that I worked at for a couple of months actually. And one of the things he talks about is this thing called resting in motion where some people think that the default state is rest, but actually that was never in the state of evolutionary adaptation. I really doubt that that was true. Where in nature, in the wilderness being hunter-gatherers and it's really unlikely that we evolved to just be at leisure, probably always have something to worry about of defending the tribe and finding enough food to survive and taking care of the children, dealing-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:46):
Spreading our genes.

Benjamin Mann (01:01:48):
And so I think about that as the busy state is the normal state and to try to work at a sustainable pace that it's a marathon, not a sprint, that's one thing that helps. And then just being around like-minded people that also care. It's not a thing that any of us can do alone. And Anthropic has incredible talent density. One of the things I love the most about our culture here is that it's very egoless. People just want the right thing to happen and I think that's another big reason that the mega offers from other companies tend to bounce off because people just love being here and they care.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):
That's amazing. I don't know how you do it. I'd be extremely stressed. I'm going to try this resting in motion strategy. Okay, so you've been at Anthropic for a long time. From the very beginning I was reading there were 7 employees back in 2020. Today there's over 1,000, I don't know what the latest number is, but I know it's over 1,000. I've heard also that you've done basically every job at Anthropic, you made big contributions to a lot of the core products, the brand, the team hiring. Let me just ask I guess what's most changed over that period? What is most different from the beginning days and which of those jobs that you've had over the years have you most loved?

Benjamin Mann (01:03:07):
I probably had 15 different roles, honestly. I was head of security for a bit. I managed the Ops team when our president was on mat leave, I was crawling around under tables, plugging in HDMI cords and doing pen testing on our building. And I started our product team from scratch and convinced the whole company that we needed to have a product instead of just being a research company. Yeah, it's been a lot. All of it very fun. I think my favorite role in that time has been when I started the labs team about a year ago, whose fundamental goal was to do transfer from research to end user products and experiences. Because fundamentally I think the way that Anthropic can differentiate itself and really win is to be on the cutting edge. We have access to the latest, greatest stuff that's happening and I think honestly through our safety research we have a big opportunity to do things that no other company can safely do.

(01:04:11):
For example, with computer use, I think that's going to be our huge opportunity basically to make it possible for an agent to use all your credentials on your computer, there has to be a huge amount of trust and to me we need to basically solve safety to make that happen. Safety and alignment. I'm pretty bullish on that kind of thing and I think we're going to see really cool stuff coming out soonish. Yeah, just leading that team has been so fun. MCP came out of that team and Claude Code came out of that team. And the people who I hired are like combo, have been a founder and also have been at big companies and seeing how things work at scale. It's just been an incredible team to work with and figure out the future with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
I want to hear more about this. Team actually the person that connected us, the reason we're doing this is a mutual friend colleague Raph Lee who I used to work with at Airbnb now works on this team, leads a lot of this work and so he wanted me to make sure I asked about this team because... I didn't realize all these things came out that team. Holy moly. What else should people know about this team? It used to be called Labs, I think it's called Frontiers now.

Benjamin Mann (01:05:16):
That's right. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
Cool. The idea here is this team works with the latest technologies that you guys have built and explores what is possible. Is that the general idea?

Benjamin Mann (01:05:26):
Yeah, and I guess I was part of Google's Area 120 and I've read about Bell Labs and how to make these innovation teams work. It's really hard to do right and I wouldn't say that we've done everything right, but I think we've done some serious innovation on the state-of-the-art from company design and Raph has been right at the center of that. When I was first fitting up the team, the first thing I did was hire a great manager and that was Raph. And so he's definitely been crucial in building the team and helping it operate well. And we defined some operating models like the journey of an idea from prototype to product and how should graduation of products and projects work, how do teams do sprint models that are effective and make sure that they're working on the right ambition level of thing. That's been really exciting.

(01:06:21):
I guess concretely we think about skating to where the puck is going and what that looks like is really understand the exponential. There's this great study that METR has done that Beth Barnes is the CEO of that organization and shows how long a time horizon of software engineering task can be done and just really internalizing that of, okay, don't build for today, build for six months from now, build for a year from now. And the things that aren't quite working that are working 20% of the time, will start working 100% of the time. And I think that's really what made Claude Code a success that we thought people are not going to be locked to their IDEs forever. People are not going to be auto completing. People will be doing everything that a software engineer needs to do and a terminal is a great place to do that because a terminal can live in lots of places. A terminal can live on your local machine, it can live in GitHub actions, it can live on a remote machine in your cluster.

(01:07:27):
That's sort of the leverage point for us and that was a lot of the inspiration. I think that's what the labs team tries to think about. Are we AGI-pilled enough?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):
What a fun place to be. By the way, fun fact, Raph was my first manager at Airbnb when I joined. I was an engineer and he was my first manager. It all worked out.

Benjamin Mann (01:07:46):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:48):
Yeah. Okay. Final question before the very exciting lighting round. I've never asked this question before. I'm curious what your answer would be if you could ask a future AGI one single question and be guaranteed to get the right answer, what would you ask?

Benjamin Mann (01:08:04):
I have two dumb answers. First for fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:07):
Okay, cool.

Benjamin Mann (01:08:07):
The first is there's this Asimov short story I love called the last question where the protagonist is throughout the eras of history is trying to ask this super intelligence how do we prevent the heat death of the universe? And I won't spoil the ending, but it's a fun question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:26):
You would ask it that question because the one in the story was unsatisfying?

Benjamin Mann (01:08:29):
Okay, I'll give it away. It keeps saying, "Need more information, need more compute." And then finally, as it's approaching the heat death of the universe, it says, "Let there be light," and then it starts the universe over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):
Oh wow. That's beautiful. That's beautiful.

Benjamin Mann (01:08:45):
That's the first cheat answer. The second cheat answer is what question can I ask you to get end more questions answered.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
Classic.

Benjamin Mann (01:08:53):
And then the third answer, which is my real question is how do we ensure the continued flourishing of humanity into the indefinite future? That's the question I'd love to know and if I can be guaranteed a correct answer then seems very valuable to ask.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):
I wonder what would happen if you ask a lot that today and then how that answer changes over the next couple years.

Benjamin Mann (01:09:15):
Yeah, maybe I'll try that. I'll put it into the deep research thing that we have and see what it comes out with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:23):
Okay. I'm excited to see what you come up with. Ben, is there anything else you wanted to mention or leave listeners with maybe as a final nugget before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Benjamin Mann (01:09:33):
Yeah, I guess my push would be these are wild times. If they don't seem wild to you, then you must be living under a rock but also get used to it because this is as normal as it's going to be. It's going to be much weirder very soon. And if you can sort of mentally prepare yourself for that, I think you'll be better off.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):
I need to make that the title of this episode. It's going to get much weirder very soon. I 100% believe that. Oh my God. I don't know what's in store. I love how you're at the center of it all. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Benjamin Mann (01:10:14):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:16):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Benjamin Mann (01:10:20):
The first one I mentioned before, Replacing Guilt by Nate Soares. Love that one. The second one is Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt. Just thinking about in a very clear way, how do you build product? It's one of the best strategy books I've read and strategy is a hard word to even think about in many ways. And then the last one is The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian. Just really thoughtfully goes through what is this problem that we care about that we're trying to solve here? What are the stakes in a version that's more updated and easier to read and digest than superintelligence?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:58):
I've got Good Strategy, Bad Strategy right behind me. I think I'm going to point to it. There it is.

Benjamin Mann (01:11:02):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:03):
And I've had Richard Rumelt on the podcast in case anyone wants to hear from him directly. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Benjamin Mann (01:11:10):
Pantheon was really good based on Ken Liu or Ted Chiang's story. Ken Liu I think. Super good talks about what does it mean if we have uploaded intelligences and what are their moral and ethical exigencies. Ted Lasso, which is supposedly about soccer, but actually it's about human relationships and how people get along and just super heartwarming and funny. And then this isn't really a TV show, but Kurzgesagt is my favorite YouTube channel and goes through random science and social problems and is just super well done and super well-made. Love watching that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:53):
Wow. Haven't heard of that as you were talking, I feel like Ted Lasso, I feel like that's what you need to put into constitutional AI, act like Ted Lasso.

Benjamin Mann (01:12:00):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):
Kind. Smart-

Benjamin Mann (01:12:03):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:03):
... Hardworking. Oh my God. There we go. I think we've solved alignment problems right here. Get those writers on this, ASAP. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to in work or in life?

Benjamin Mann (01:12:15):
Well, a really dumb one is, have you tried asking Claude? And this is getting more and more common where recently I asked a coworker like, "Hey, who's working on X?" And they were like, "Let me Claude that for you." And then they sent me the link to the thing afterwards and I was like, "Oh yeah, thanks. That's great." But maybe more of a philosophical one I would say, everything is hard. Just to remind ourselves that things that feel like they're supposed to be easy, it's okay to not be easy and sometimes you just have to push through anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:49):
And rest in motion while you're doing that.

Benjamin Mann (01:12:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):
Final question. I don't know if you want people to know this, but I was browsing through your Medium posts and you have a post called Five Tips to Poop like a Champion. I'd love it. Can you share one tip to poop like a champion if you remember your tips?

Benjamin Mann (01:13:06):
I of course do. It's actually my most popular Medium posts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:12):
Okay, great. I can see that. It's a great title.

Benjamin Mann (01:13:15):
I think maybe my biggest tip would be use a bidet. It's amazing. It's life-changing. It's so good. Some people are kind of freaked out by it. It's the standard in countries like Japan and I think it's just more civilized. And in 10 or 20 years people would be like, how could you not use that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):
And a bidet could be like a Japanese toilet. That's along the same lines.

Benjamin Mann (01:13:40):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:40):
Right. Okay. I love where we went with this. Ben, this was incredible. Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you so much for sharing so much real talk. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe go work at Anthropic and how can listeners be useful to you?

Benjamin Mann (01:13:52):
You can find me online at benjmann.net and on our website, we have a great careers page that we're working on making a little bit easier to access and figure out, but definitely point Claude at it and it can help you figure out what could be interesting for you. And how can listeners be useful to me? I think safety pill yourself, that's the number one thing and spread it to your network. I think. Like I said, there are very few people working on this and it's so important. Yeah, think hard about it and try to look at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):
Thanks for spreading the gospel, Ben, thank you so much for being here.

Benjamin Mann (01:14:31):
Thanks so much, Lenny.

# 35 years of product design wisdom from Apple, Disney, Pinterest and beyond | Bob Baxley

## Transcript

Bob Baxley (00:00:00):
Almost everyone living in a modern economy now is going to have hundreds of interactions with a phone or with a computer. And unfortunately, a lot of those interactions are not going to be great. We have an obligation as product people to put that emotional energy back into people's lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
You actually have a really unique perspective on just what is design.

Bob Baxley (00:00:17):
Design is trying to imagine the future you want to live in and then take the steps to make it real. Saying a company is design-led does not mean it's designer-led. I've never seen somebody graft it on after the fact. It's there at the beginning in the root DNA or doesn't exist.

(00:00:31):
It wasn't a successful stint at Pinterest. I just bounced off the culture. I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Why did you decide to join Apple?

Bob Baxley (00:00:42):
I just seek out opportunities to witness history. The whole company is constantly asking how can the thing that I'm working on be a little bit better?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Why do you Think that people that have left Apple, a lot of amazing things haven't emerged? Today, my guest is Bob Baxley. Bob is a designer, executive and advisor who's built in led design teams at Apple, Pinterest, Yahoo, and most recently ThoughtSpot. Over the course of his career that spanned over three decades, Bob has played a pivotal role in the design of the Apple online store, the Apple App Store, Pinterest, and early in his career Yahoo Answers, products that have been used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.

(00:01:21):
Bob also mentors individuals and advises organizations that are working to improve the practice, craft and culture of digital product design. There is something in this conversation for everyone from why you should consider having designed report engineering, why it's your moral obligation to build great products, why you should wait as long as possible to draw a picture or create a prototype of your idea to what the Moon Landing can teach us about building better teams and products. I could listen to Bob all day. I learned a ton from this conversation, including a bunch of really unique insights that I've never heard before.

(00:01:54):
A big thank you to Annie Warner, Andrew Hogan, Irene A, and Joff Redfern for suggesting questions for this conversation.

(00:02:23):
This entire episode is brought to you by Stripe. There's a reason that I've had more guests on this podcast from Stripe than any other company. It's because they hire the best people and they build incredible products. You probably know them for their payments platform, which powers my newsletter, and also companies like Nvidia and Salesforce and Zoom and DoorDash. What you may not know is that they have several other products that can help accelerate your revenue, such as Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of, OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies. Stripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers however you want from simple recurring billing to usage-based billing to sales negotiated contracts.

(00:03:08):
There's also Stripe's Optimized Checkout Suite which is a plug and play super optimized payments flow that natively supports over 100 global dynamic payment methods. There's also a product called LINQ, which is an accelerated checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that have a product in the market today use Stripe to monetize it. Half of Fortune 100 companies use Stripe. $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of global GDP. Use Stripe to handle all of your payment related needs, billing, manage revenue operations, and launch or invent new business models. Learn more at stripe.com. Bob, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Bob Baxley (00:04:00):
Lenny, thank you so much. Thanks for having me, but also just thank you for what you do. We are still in early days to try to figure out how to make software together. I think of it like where the film industry was in the 1920s. We've had our talkie moment. We're on the cusp of having our shift to color movement, but we're still trying to figure out how to make movies and a podcast like yours specifically yours I think is one of the greatest resources we have for learning from one another. I appreciate all you're doing for the community and for helping us as a community make better software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:31):
Wow. Well, I really appreciate that. That means a lot coming from you. There's so much I want to talk about in our conversation. There's a story that I hear that you often tell, which is when somebody asked Steve Jobs once, what is your favorite product that you've built that you work on? And his answer, what's that story?

Bob Baxley (00:04:49):
So I actually can't remember where I heard this, but I believe the story's true. Steve at one point was recounting the products that he had created that he was most proud of, and if I recall the whole list, it was the Apple II, the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, I think Apple retail was in the list and then he said Apple itself. When I heard that and when I've reflected on it, that is the longest lasting thing. I remember there was also a story that Steve was talking to, I think it was either Ed Catmull or John Lasseter at Pixar, and he said, "Everything we make is going to be a doorstop in three years, but the stuff you guys make, they're still going to be watching in 100 years." So I think Steve had some concept of the longevity of these things.

(00:05:33):
They knew the products themselves were very ephemeral, but there's something about the culture of Apple that's lasted a very long time and I personally believe will last for some time yet to come. It's a way of making decisions, it's a way of behaving, it's a way of seeing the value of technology in the world and it infuses everything in that company. I mean everything from the checkout system when you go to the receptionist to what it's like in the cafeteria. At least when I was there, they had patented the pizza box because they had reinvented the pizza box that you would get at Cafe Max because the whole company is constantly asking how can the thing that I'm working on be a little bit better? I think that was something Steve brought to them and had them constantly asking that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:16):
One more Apple question then I'll move on to other stuff. Why do you think that people that have left Apple, a lot of amazing things haven't emerged from people that have left? Humane was a recent example. We're recording this the day after Jony Ive Open AI emerged so we'll see what happens there but just feels like there hasn't been a ton of alumni that have built incredible things.

Bob Baxley (00:06:38):
Obviously Tony Fadell would be one with Nest and he'd be an outlier. I think the people that... I went to Pinterest and did not have a successful time in my year and a half at Pinterest. I think my own particular mistake, and I've seen this with some other Apple executives as well as we went directly from Apple, I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday. I didn't give myself time to recalibrate to the Pinterest culture. I think at some level, a lot of the challenge is that Apple, and it's not just Apple, I think every major tech company, they have really powerful cultures.

(00:07:11):
You get indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep. It fuses all of your behavior and how you conduct yourself in the company, away from the company. I think it's pretty hard to immigrate successfully from one of those environments to another. Apple is one of the strongest cultures and there's not many other cultures that natively operate like that. Airbnb is one exception. And so you have guys like Hiroki Asai who leads all of marketing and all of product and Hiroki is crushing at Airbnb. He was incredibly successful at Apple.

(00:07:43):
It also should be noted that he had, it was a multi-year gap between the time he left Apple and the time he started Airbnb. He gave himself a little bit of time to get through the... At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve used to talk about the Apple car wash. Then when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well. And so I think Hiroki gave himself time to do that and I think that's probably a lot of why he's been so successful at Airbnb. The thing I took away from Apple, and I think this is true for anybody changing from one major culture to another is most likely the new place hires you because of the values of the organization you left, but not the behaviors.

(00:08:23):
And so I think it's important to recalibrate and say, well, I want to hold onto these values. So at Apple, attention to detail, product excellence, doing everything you can for the customer and the user so try to hold onto those values but then think, okay, how are those values best expressed in this culture? I was more successful at expressing those values in the culture of ThoughtSpot, which was my last job than I was in the culture of Pinterest. If I had to do it again, I could probably do better at Pinterest. I think that's useful for anybody leaving one very specific culture and going someplace else, try to hold onto the values but not the behaviors.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:59):
This is so interesting and I appreciate you sharing that, the way you described it that it wasn't a successful stint at Pinterest. A lot of people don't share that sort of story and don't put it that way. They see on their LinkedIn, oh, a head of design at Pinterest. Oh, amazing so cool. And then if you're like, oh, okay, but it didn't work out that well, I think that's really interesting. Is there anything more you can share there about what you learned for other people to maybe avoid that sort of situation? Anything you took away from that experience?

Bob Baxley (00:09:25):
One of my friends that was at Pinterest, I'm still friends with, he said, "I just thought of it as you bounced off the culture." I think that's kind of the way to think of it. I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard. Everybody cares about each other. It's never insulting, but it's intense. That's not really where Pinterest was at the time. Again, all this is a decade ago, so I don't know what any of these companies are like today, but at least when I was there, Pinterest had posters in every conference room that said, big poster that said, say the hard thing. Well, that's where Pinterest was at the time, and I can assure you nobody at Apple was having to remind you to say the hard thing.

(00:10:07):
And so I probably could have picked up on that better than I did. I'll say these careers are really hard and the higher up you go, people think of it like you're climbing a pyramid. I think of it more like you're going out on a branch on a tree and the branch gets a lot more flimsy and can break and you can fall and you get buffeted about by the wind. It's often at a time in your life when there's a lot going on with your family, there could be things going on with your parents' health. I lost my mother when I was at Pinterest. My kids were starting high school, so we're struggling with the teenage years. I had a long commute. It's a lot going on and these jobs are super demanding.

(00:10:46):
Everything around you is changing really rapidly and you're under tremendous pressure because the financial and success stakes are super high. I think the people falling off of these jobs is the common use case. That is the common story. We have a bias towards survivors and we all talk about how it looks like they made it to the top, but everybody that makes it to the top, there's hundreds of people that don't. One of the things I took away when I was at Pinterest was I came to think that the job of a startup was to grow the founder so they could continue to lead the startup. I think what's true for founders, also true for a lot of the other folks in the executive staff, it's very hard to grow emotionally and developmentally at the rate that the company grows.

(00:11:32):
A lot of times I think people get outgrown by the role, and I saw that across Apple. I've experienced that myself at different times in my career. I see that happening with my friends and it feels like a failure. I mean, that is the human experience, that's what happens. It's very hard to grow as fast as some of these companies are growing and we could debate the merits of Mark Zuckerberg for example. But when you think about the trajectory from being a kid in a dorm room to within five years, Facebook's a big thing. I mean, think of your own life. Can you process that level of evolution and change? I don't know, I think that's really super hard to do that and stay balanced.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:15):
And also keep doing that for so long. There'll be founders, I think it was Brian's maybe first job or second job, and he's doing that now for 15 years in a row.

Bob Baxley (00:12:24):
Oh, founders, it's their life. It's very unusual to see founders move out. I had this other theory that a startup is still a startup until the founder moves aside. By my definition of even Meta is still a startup in a way that Amazon's not, and Airbnb is still a startup in a way that Pinterest is not because Ben's moved on. You don't find out if the culture can sustain itself until the founders are gone and then you really see what's going to happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
Just to close the loop here, one takeaway here that I think is really interesting is that you can fail in a job and things will be okay. Clearly you're doing A okay and having a place that doesn't work out, doesn't destroy your career, which I think a lot of people feel like if they're not doing well in their current job, it's over. Things are all going to go downhill

Bob Baxley (00:13:08):
Your career's not your life. There's a lot more to it than that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:11):
And then just to give someone something tactical here, so you've realized the culture of Pinterest, you bounced off of it. I love that metaphor. If you were to, when you're looking at new companies, what's one thing you look at or a question you ask or something you now look at to make sure you avoid that in the future, that culture clash?

Bob Baxley (00:13:30):
I'm fortunate at this stage of my career that I usually get to interview with the CEO or the founders or something like that. What I'm usually looking for is do they have a story as to why they believe in design? Really in their heart and soul, do they care about design? Because if I go into a company that doesn't really value the thing that I do, I'm just not going to have a great time and I'm going to be constantly buffeting up against all sorts of people. I want to make sure I've got air cover from the highest people in the company setting the culture.

(00:13:57):
In the case of, again, my most recent job was with a company called ThoughtSpot. And ThoughtSpot was founded by a gentleman named Ajeet Singh, and Ajeet grew up in rural India, but he tells this really great story about he studied chemical engineering, he moves to the United States. Early in his career, he's working for Honeywell and they did a couple of engagements with IDEO. As a very young person, he got to see what IDEO did and he realized the power of design and he's taken that to all of his companies. He started Nutanix before he came to ThoughtSpot, before he started ThoughtSpot. And so when I heard that, I'm like, oh, this is a guy that gets design right from the very beginning.

(00:14:32):
I've also come to believe that I actually have never seen a company that grafted design on after the founding. I could name lots of companies that I think are kind of design led, not always designer led, but design led or design centric. But I've never seen somebody grafted on after the fact. It's there at the beginning in the root DNA or doesn't exist. And so the thing that I'm looking for when I interview is, is it there at the beginning? Can I get a credible story that tracks it back to that?

(00:14:59):
And if that's the case, then I think I can find a way to navigate in that culture. We have a shared value system in a way that as an American, I could immigrate to Australia and the culture would be slightly different, but we'd have a shared value system that I could relate to. If I moved to, I don't know, Burma or China or something, it would be wildly more challenging because the base view of the world, the base understanding of the world's just different and it'd be much harder for me to adapt to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):
I think a way to extrapolate that insight is just whatever function you're in, get a sense of how important that function is to that business. Do the founders value engineering? Do they value product? Do they value design? Depending on who you are.

Bob Baxley (00:15:42):
Why would you want to work in a place that doesn't value the thing that you do? God, that would suck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:47):
You actually have a really unique perspective on just what is design that I haven't heard before. Let me ask you that question is what is design?

Bob Baxley (00:15:55):
Well, I'm going to go back to the Edward Tufte quote that I use all the time, which is design is clear thinking made visible. And so I think most people when they talk about design, they think of it as the visual expression of an idea. They think of it as a team or a function or a group. I think of it as a holistic mindset. When design thinking became big, I was always really confused because I didn't know how else you could think. That was just how I naturally thought, which is design is trying to imagine the future you want to live in and then take the steps to make it real.

(00:16:27):
It's living with a certain type of intentionality in almost a Buddhist type way, which is different from science, which is observational trying to understand. It's a little bit different from engineering, which is we kind of know where we want go at the end, but we're trying to go one step at a time versus design's trying to see some further out future state and account for a larger or a different set of constraints and issues than engineering or some of the other problem solving methodologies. Again, I look at it as a company, does the company think in a design mindset and Apple does, Airbnb does. I don't get the sense that Google does and I don't get the sense that Amazon does. That's not a critique on them. I don't think that those organizations are competing on design in the same way. But again, I want to go work at a place that as an organization thinks in a design type method.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:19):
Along those lines, a lot of people imagine every founder, every product builder is just, yes, I'd love amazing design. I'd love our products to be incredibly beautiful, intuitive, so easy for everyone to use and understand, but they don't actually invest in these areas and they don't put a lot of resources into the designing process. What's the best pitch you can make and that you do make to companies to help them see the strategic value of design and the bottom of the value of design.

Bob Baxley (00:17:50):
Let me back up and just dissect a little bit the way you described design, you described it in really tactical terms. You said beautiful, intuitive products that make sense. I think it was something like that. What you were describing was you were describing the part of the iceberg that sits above the water line, which is the result. That's one of the outcomes of design, but that's not the real heavy lifting of design. Design is more like liberal arts or philosophy or something. It's like what do we try to achieve at a much lower level? And so what I talk to founders and people about the value of design, what I'm pushing them on is when we can get organizational alignment around what we want to do philosophically, why do we exist? What's the vision for the company? How do all these things ladder up through vision, through mission, through specific tenets, design strategies.

(00:18:36):
And then into actual execution. How do we ladder that whole thing up so it makes sense as a whole? That's the magic of design. The difference is when you design things, you end up with a bunch of bricks that are piled into a beautiful impenetrable wall. If you don't do that, you end up with a bunch of bricks scattered across the backyard and they don't really add up to anything. I think that's one of the things, if you look, again to go back to Apple, but we could also talk about Lego Lyca, Porsche, Airbnb, Patagonia, there's other companies that make sense as a design centered organization. If you think about everything they do, it all ladders together into one cohesive sensical thing. It's integrated. Makes sense as a unit.

(00:19:20):
I think that's a huge difference and an incredible strategic advantage because the company can operate with much greater efficiency. They can onboard new people and get them in line. Even Apple, for example, the team that designed the online store, we had six designers for a store that ran in 30 some odd countries, 12 and a half thousand instances of the store doing billions of dollars of revenue. We had six designers. Any other company would've had 60 or more. Apple's able to operate with much smaller staff because they have real clarity of vision of what they're doing. And the benefit of operating with a smaller staff is not just that it saves money on payroll, it's that you have... The way the minds come together to create something that feels like a single whole is a much higher chance when you have fewer people involved.

(00:20:10):
I joke about The Beatles. You get The Beatles with four people, you don't get The Beatles with eight people and you certainly don't get it with 24 people. The teams get too big and you can't get that what Brian Eno calls scenius. Brian Eno has this great word that he uses, scenius is the genius that comes when you have a group together. Scenius is the collective idea of genius and I think that's something that's really magical that I've experienced in my career, but usually in smaller groups. It's hard to do with a giant group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:40):
I love this metaphor of The Beatles as the way most people describe this is designed by committee never works. I love that the way you describe it is the Beatles is like the ideal size a small group versus a committee.

Bob Baxley (00:20:54):
I just always have to point out to people that there are 20 people that worked on the original Mac. I mean it's 20 of them, that's it, 20. Susan Kare was one of them, Andy Hertzfeld, you go through the list, 20 of them are on the patent. There's 24 that are on the iPhone patent. Now there's other people involved, but generally there's 24 people on the iPhone patent. And that was the team. That was Project Purple that was doing that stuff. These are not massive massive groups doing these things. If you had put a massive group, I don't know man, maybe it'd end up with the Zune or something completely different. Who knows?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):
They probably did have a massive group on the Zune.

Bob Baxley (00:21:27):
Yeah, so there's something, four is too few for what we're trying to achieve at scale. But even if you look at Pixar, any good movie on the scripting and story side, it's usually a fairly small team. Even when you move into character development, stuff like that, it's fairly small and then it really scales when you move into production. It's just hard to figure out something new to do together when there's too many people involved.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
I think that word new is really key here. I think when people hear this advice, they're thinking at their existing company, should we just keep our company small? Should we not scale this thing that we have? I think what you're describing, which I completely agree with is new stuff for sure you want to keep the team small and tight, but as things grow and scale, what's your take on just, okay, actually it's okay to have a lot of people on this.

Bob Baxley (00:22:13):
Well, you have to bring a lot of people in once you figure out what you're doing. And so to your point, once you realize you're building Disneyland and you've got the whole thing set and people know what it's about, then they can come in and understand, oh, I'm playing my piece over here. I'm supposed to design the line experience for the new ride sitting in Tomorrowland, but I know where that fits into this larger thing. I think you can scale once you have clarity of vision, but it's very difficult to get vision with a lot of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:42):
Great. I think that's really powerful advice. It's just when you're starting something new. I actually had a CPA of N26 who was basically leading Google Hangouts, the initial launch of Google Hangouts, and he told the story of they put so many resources on it. We got to win. We got to do this. Larry Page or Sergey was sitting next to him just like we got to make this work and putting everything they could into it and it didn't work out. And I think that's-

Bob Baxley (00:23:07):
No, no, the more people you put in it, the slower everything becomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:09):
I want to go back to something you said about what design is. I think this is really interesting. And so the way you described design to a lot of people, it sounds like that's like product management also and product leadership, setting, strategy, vision, figuring out how everything fits together. I think your experience here, I think Apple is a very different kind of company where design actually leads a lot of this. At a lot of other companies, it doesn't work that way. Any thoughts? And just how you advise companies, think about the split between design and product management that aren't Apple.

Bob Baxley (00:23:38):
One of the best lines I ever heard was from my friend Joseph O'Sullivan at dinner one night. He said saying a company is design led does not mean it's designer led. And so what I try to hammer home with people is that when I talk about design as a mindset, I'm talking about it as a mindset. Anybody could have that mindset functioning in any role, any designer could have a product mindset. In fact, I think that's a lot of what the design community is trying to get at now when they say designers should be speaking the language of business. I think what they're saying is designers need to inhabit the product mindset as well. Maybe to some degree even the sales mindset.

(00:24:11):
Look, both functions matter. I look at my counterparts in product and I assume that they're much better connected to the customer, that they understand much better the business realities, and I expect them to drive the roadmap. I may have some points of view on the roadmap. I may offer some critique. I may have my own suggestions and agenda in there. But once they say this is the roadmap, I have to believe that they're right and I don't try to bleed into their space. I very much believe that once you get into a company, your job is to figure out your role and respect the boundaries between the different groups.

(00:24:43):
I'm like, you guys tell us what you need us to do, what the features need to be, when they need to be delivered, what the issues are, and then give us the time and space to come up with a solution to those problems. And then we can work together to decide whether or not our solutions actually solve the problem as you understand it, but I'll stay out of your roadmap and you stay out of my design stop and let's try to get to the promised land together. I assume that the product managers, particularly in enterprise SaaS companies, like my team, ThoughtSpot did data analytics. My team didn't know anything about data analytics. We didn't have any of that insight. We didn't have the bandwidth, the mental horsepower to go out and do that stuff. We had our hands full just trying to figure out the UI.

(00:25:22):
It's one of the points I try to make too, when people are starting to theorize that gen AI can remove teammates and oh, the designers don't need engineers and the PMs don't need the designers and everybody thinks they can throw engineering overboard. And I'm like, stop it. We all need each other and we need each other because we need those different mindsets. One of those mindsets inhabits somebody's head completely. I just don't think you can simultaneously hold multiple mindsets in your head. It's not that one of my PM counterparts couldn't bring a lot to the design table, it's just I need you to play that position. Like in baseball, the second-

Bob Baxley (00:26:00):
Like in baseball, the second baseman doesn't cover first. That's not how it works. Everybody's got to spread the field and play their position so we can take care of the whole thing and respect that together we're going to come up with something better than any one of us would've come up with alone and embrace the creative tension, welcome it. We still have to all go out to lunch and love each other and have fun together and keep in mind that we're having fun together, but I like the rub. That's where all the magic happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:28):
That was a very illuminating clarification. Something else that I heard you believe that I haven't heard before is that design share report to engineering.

Bob Baxley (00:26:38):
So I'll say that every company culture is different and different organizations work in different ways. In my experience, I think that design is most successful at impacting what ships at the end if design is considered phase zero of the engineering process, rather than a by product or a part of the product process. What I've seen happen over and over in my experience, a ThoughtSpot, Pinterest, other places when you're working directly with product, it's easy to leave engineering out of the loop and product and design can go cook up stuff that doesn't quite make sense technically or is really hard to implement or is just a bridge too far. And I think that engineering doesn't feel like they're a part of it, so you bring them at the end and they haven't really been brought along so they don't quite understand how to extrapolate from the specs you make into what should really ship.

(00:27:25):
Maybe they don't bring the same level of enthusiasm to it, because they haven't been brought along. So I think there's something about having the design and engineering team very tightly connected and kind of living together. And it's not that you have to do that structurally from an organization point of view, but it's hard-pressed if you don't. I also think you can just account for timelines and costs and things better when design's part of engineering. And many of my design friends will push back on this and they'll say design should be its own thing and it should be an independent group and we should have three co-equal branches of government, and that's a solid argument as well, and there's some places where that works beautifully. My experiences at design rarely has a budget or an army, and so it's very hard for them to really hold their own in that sort of a setting.

(00:28:09):
Also, although you'll see people argue with me on LinkedIn about how design needs to be measured and we need to have metrics and be held accountable for a number, I don't really believe that in my heart. I've just never seen a number that you could apply to design that we could reliably affect. So I think it's very hard to hold design as an organization accountable for a particular outcome the way that most of the other C-level roles are held accountable. Sales has a number, engineering has very specific expectations, product has very specific expectations. And although I know this will frustrate some of my friends, I just haven't been able to figure out how that works for design. And again, it can vary from culture to culture. Certainly there's very successful chief design officers and we could go through the list. I just think in many companies it's a stretch, it's just hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):
What I see work, and I'm curious to get your take is just product, engineering, design have exactly the same goal and the more everyone... And their performance as an employee is tied to the same thing essentially because then everyone is pushing in the same direction versus like, oh, I have my engineering goal, I have my design goal, I have my PM goal, and just creates all kinds of weird incentives.

Bob Baxley (00:29:17):
Yeah, look, I would kind of defer to you on that, honestly. You've talked to a lot more people across a lot more companies, so you have a much broader set of information you're working with. If you add my whole career together, I've worked at maybe half a dozen places, so a fairly limited sample set. And every design team that I've ever been a part of, I've been a part of. So I also kind of have a biased view as to what didn't work for me in those particular organizations. I'll go back to what I said, every company's different, every culture is slightly different. It's not one size fits all.

(00:29:45):
I point out the idea of design reporting to engineering just because I don't think people consider the possibility often enough. So there's three options, design is its own thing, design is part of product, design is part of engineering. And I think there's a moment when you can back up and make an intelligent choice about the pros and cons for each of those options inside your org. And so I would encourage people to just take a design mentality and put on that designer mindset just for a moment and say, well, what's the thing that we're trying to produce? What's the incentives that we're trying to create? What's the future state that we're trying to get to? And which of these three options, permutations is going to help us get there the best?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
I love how radical this idea is. I've not heard it. I think designers will be like, " You stop it. Just stop it." So have you operated this way? Have you had design report to engineering in companies you've worked at?

Bob Baxley (00:30:38):
Sorry, but that's how it worked at Apple the whole time under Steve. Design always reported to engineering. Now I think it's structured a little bit differently, but design has always been part of engineering at Apple, so I saw it work quite effectively there obviously.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:53):
It's so interesting. Okay, so say just to give someone something very tactical to do on their team, say they don't want to go to this extreme and move the design org under engineering, what's something you've seen work that helps achieve similar outcomes with having engineers integrated early in the design process?

Bob Baxley (00:31:09):
Yeah, look, I think you have to find some way that you are able to identify a few people in engineering that I refer to as creative technologists. So these are people that can come into what's ultimately kind of a fairly airy-fairy philosophical discussion about what we could do and what's right from a conceptual model perspective. Ultimately, it's sort of a philosophy issue. And there's not that many PMs or engineers that can sit in that space and be comfortable with the ambiguity of it all. A PM's likely going to come in and they're going to say, okay, well that was a great one hour. What's the next step? And as a designer I'm always like, well, the next step is we're going to have another meeting and we're going to talk again. And the engineers oftentimes when they're starting to hear different ideas, they're already cutting into the code and they're trying to figure out what's hard and what's easy.

(00:31:54):
And so I think the trick is at the beginning, can you find a small group of people from the different functions that can sit with the ambiguity of the space and talk through a broad range of ideas to identify the direction we want to go into? And then once everybody kind of falls in love with the direction, then you can go into the more tactical mindset of, okay, well, when we can ship it and who can we show it to and how are we going to code it and when's it going to go live and all those sorts of things. But the trick is to try to find a group that can sit, again, in the ambiguous maybe space. I do think it's critical to have everybody together at the beginning so they all feel like they're part of it. And the worst thing is when you bring something fully baked... Well, the worst thing when you bring something fully baked to anybody for their approval.

(00:32:36):
We could talk about this when you take a final design to an exec and an exec sees it for the first time in a high resolution state, I'll get to that in a second. But when you go to an engineering team says, "Hey, we've been working in the lab for six months and we have this thing that we love it and we just can't wait for you guys to build it, and here it is," I don't know, [inaudible 00:32:54] mention here. They're going to be excited about. They're not order takers. How do you make them part of the process? And every product of consequence that I worked on, there was some moment when we were showing it to some critical person and you could see that they fell in love with it. Sometimes they're literally pointing at the comps on the board, sometime you're in a meeting and they're just like, "God, I just love this."

(00:33:14):
And for me, that was always the critical moment because I knew that design can't bring you this stuff into the world on its own. We can't raise this baby, we need the village, and we need the village to fall in love with the baby. And so until that happens, you're not really quite sure if this thing's going to take off or not. And so it was always extremely important to me that you had a few key engineers and some product people fall in love with it so they could defend it and embrace it and enhance it and add to it. And you got to bring them along at the very beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
What I'm hearing there is there's a big part of just buy-in and then there's also just obviously more good ideas early are great.

Bob Baxley (00:33:52):
Yeah, sorry. Buy-in doesn't feel quite right to me, because buy-in feels like, oh, I've come to agree with you. And that's different from it's a part of me. When I'm talking to teams, the thing I try to tell them is, I walk into the office every day with the idea that everyone that I work with is fundamentally a maker. Everybody in product design, engineering, we've all chosen these careers. Everybody's super smart, everybody's super ambitious. Everybody could have done a thousand other things, but they're choosing to spend their precious lifetime and creative energy creating software.

(00:34:28):
And so I believe in my heart that they're all fundamentally makers. And the thing that I know about makers is that they all want to make something they're proud of so they can take it home at the end of the day and show it to their parents and say, "Look at what I made at school with my friends today." That's the fundamental thing, and they're all doing it from their own different points of view and their own different incentives and mindsets, but they all at the end of the day want to make something they're proud of. And so it's not a matter of getting their buy-in, it's a matter of them being a part of it. I don't know, it's a part of their soul in a really deep, meaningful way. And I'm not sure you can graph that onto somebody after the fact. They kind of need to be there at the moment of inception, if you will.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):
Wow, that's a really beautiful answer. I imagine for a lot of people hearing this, making every feature and product they build a part of their soul feels like a very high bar if they're building some kind of B2B SaaS software. So I guess just thoughts in just how much you should spend, how much time, how many resources, how deep you go on design for all these things you're building. Say you're building some kind of, I don't know, expense management system or HRS thing, just like, what do you recommend people do with, in terms of just how far to go in design as a lever, as a differentiator maybe?

Bob Baxley (00:35:49):
Well, inherent in your question is this assumption that design takes more time. And so I'm going to kind of reject that premise, because I don't think design takes more time. I think design exists. There is going to be a design. It's whether it's going to be a good one or not. And I think there's things that you can do so that you're able to operate it at a quicker pace as design. Again, if you get the... We haven't talked about tenets yet, but we'll get to that in a moment. If you kind of create a shared philosophical understanding of the product and what you're trying to do, you can go really fast because you're not asking the question of what should you do, you're asking the question of, what would this company with what we stand for do for this thing? And that's a much easier question that's much smaller.

(00:36:29):
So if you look at the companies that have the largest design teams, they're often the companies that have the most ambiguous cultures and the most unclear design vision. When you go to companies that really know what they're doing and they're clear that this is who we are, this is what we stand for, the design teams are super small because they're not sitting there trying to do all these permutations with color and typography and ideas. They're operating in a really narrow vein, because they know who they are. It's very much like individuals. When you're a teenager or a young adult, you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to wear because you haven't really sorted it out yet. But by the time you get to be a little bit older, you've kind of got your personal style, and so dressing in the morning gets to be a lot easier.

(00:37:09):
Like at Pinterest. I was at Pinterest at a point when Pinterest wasn't quite sure who it was. And so when we were going to do an onboarding flow, we had to look at a really broad sweep of things, because we were trying to sort it out. But you had other places that knew what they were about, Apple's the key example there, we weren't trying to figure out what it was about. We were trying to figure out what was the apple way to do this particular thing, and so that moves a lot faster.

(00:37:31):
And I agree, look, having your soul at every little checkbox sounds like a high bar and in some ways it is. I think you need to be able to back up and look at the product, maybe not at every state, but generally every six months or a year, you need to back up and ask yourself, am I proud of this? Is this something I am happy to be a part of? Do I believe in this? Is it a representative of my best work given the circumstances I was in, which has limitations around time and resources and everything else, is this the best I could do or am I just sort of trying to get through the day I have other goals?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:06):
So let's actually follow the thread of design tenets and principles. This is something I've heard about you, that you're a big fan of design tenets versus design principles. What is the difference? Why is this so important?

Bob Baxley (00:38:20):
Yeah, so look, there's whole websites dedicated to design principles, and if you go and you read it, you'll see a lot of principles like simple, clear, beautiful, fast, secure. You'll hear these words and all these words are great. I mean, obviously I have nothing against any of these words, but they're not useful as decision-making tools because nobody would ever argue the opposite. Nobody ever sat in a meeting and said, "Oh, forget clear. Let's try to make it as confusing as possible." So the idea of clear, it's nice to have out there as, I don't know, sort of a platitude to move towards, but I just don't think it helps you make decisions. And so tenets are really decision-making tools and it's sort of like... A classic one is paper versus plastic. It's just too complicated to reconsider that every time you're at the grocery store. So you sort of make a rule for yourself and you're just a paper person or a plastic person, you move on from there.

(00:39:07):
And so it's sort of that at scale. And the story comes from when they were starting to work on Keynotes, apparently the guy who was responsible for originating Keynote went to Steve and said, "How should we think about Keynote?" And Steve said, "I want you to keep three things in mind. One is it should be difficult to make ugly presentations. Two, you should focus on cinematic quality transitions. And three, you should optimize for innovation over PowerPoint compatibility." And if you take that last one in particular, if he hadn't kind of said, we're going to go this way instead of that way, that team would've spent the next 10 years gouging each other's eyes out over whether they should try to go for PowerPoint compatibility or innovation. And so when I was at ThoughtSpot, I realized pretty early on that I wasn't going to be able to have any sort of command and control over everything that was going to happen in the product.

(00:39:56):
There was too many people involved, too many engineering teams, most of them were in India. I needed to move from a mindset of control to one of choreography. I needed to try to set the culture and set certain design tenets that everyone could internalize and follow and hopefully then make the right decisions in that groove, if you will. And so we had three, I think you can't have more than three or four because you need everybody to memorize them. They can't be consulting a handbook. And so, one of them was documentation is a failure state. In enterprise companies, a lot of times people think, "Oh, we'll just put it in the manual. It'll be part of the training." And I would constantly be coming back and go, "Stop it. Nobody wants to learn our software. Nobody cares. We are just one more browser tab in a world of browser tabs. We are not this user's complete world. They do not want to learn this stuff."

(00:40:46):
Documentation's a failure state. Maybe we can't always avoid it, but we should do everything we can to simplify things so you can figure it out in the context of the product. That's number one. Number two is every interaction should start simple and the users should have to opt into complexity. So our main competitor at the time was Tableau. Tableau started with complexity. That was their whole value prop is like, "We're a super powerful tool. We can do all sorts of stuff." So when you sit down at Tableau, it feels like you're flying the space shuttle. And if you're a professional data analyst, that's great. That's the kind of tool you wanted. That wasn't what ThoughtSpot was about. We were trying to take data analytics into the hands of what I call mere mortals, also known as business users, people who didn't live in breathe this stuff every day.

(00:41:26):
So our goal with them was they could sit down and it was an approachable piece of software and they could turn on all the bells and whistles and power if they wanted it, so that was the second one. Start simple, let the users opt into complexity. And the third one was the entire product should look and feel like it came from a single mind. And this was a tenet to try to combat the natural tendency of enterprise companies to really fragment because you have all these different teams working on their incentive to work just on their little piece. And so they think about what's right for them and they don't back up to look at the whole thing.

(00:41:55):
And so we had this tenet, the whole thing should look and feel like it came from a single mind to just try to remind people, how does this fit into the whole system? And sometimes we need to go along and do things that work for the product that don't necessarily work quite the way we might want them to for our feature. And so those tenets were all... Again, they were all decision-making tools. And when we would have design debates, we could just come back to this, wait, are we actually starting simple and forcing them to opt into complexity or are we doing something else here?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:21):
So there's kind of this implication in this discussion about tenets is that you need to be very opinionated. There's a clear here's what's in and here's what's out. Is there anything more along those lines and are there other tenet examples you could share to give people some inspiration as they think about their potential tenets?

Bob Baxley (00:42:39):
It's very context specific, so it's a little bit like what are your tenets for parenting? It's a very specific personal type thing that's germane to your particular context. So I'm not sure if I have a lot of other examples, and I haven't heard this used by a lot of other companies, so I haven't been able to add a bunch of stuff. We tried to come out with tenets for individual features and we had trouble with that. It felt like they operated at sort of the design strategy level. And I just think that varies dramatically from company to company. What I would look for is if you're a design leader or a product leader, try to pay attention to what are the debates that we keep having over and over where people kind of seem to be digging in and things sort of seem to be bifurcating into two camps.

(00:43:23):
And then is there something we can do where we just have that debate once and for all, we decide as an organization, we're going left instead of right, and you're absolutely correct. You have to be opinionated, but that's how you're going to win. There's no unopinionated software that's been successful. You have to have a point of view. The question is, what's it going to be? So I'd say practically just try to look for places where it seems the team's having the same debate over and over and have it once, get it done, and put it behind you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:52):
And make it a tenet. And why is the word tenet versus principle so important?

Bob Baxley (00:43:57):
I don't know. I settled on tenet. I'd have to go look up the definition. I was trying to differentiate it from principles because I think principles are just... I describe principles as sort of Applehood & Motherpie. Again, they're just not something people are going to argue over. And so I didn't think it was wise to try to co-op that word and change how people think about it so much as I might be more successful just coming up with a different word altogether.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:24):
Makes sense. This entire episode is brought to you by Stripe. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that has a product in the market today uses Stripe to monetize it. $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of the entire global GDP. And Stripe isn't just a payments platform, they also have a product called Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of: OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies.

(00:44:56):
Stripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers no matter your pricing model, from simple recurring billing, to usage based billing, to sales negotiated contracts, collect and retain more revenue, automate revenue management workflows, and accept payments globally. Use Stripe to handle all of your payment related needs, including billing, revenue, operations, checkout flows, or simply launching or inventing new business models. Learn all the ways that Stripe can grow revenue for your business at Stripe.com.

(00:45:26):
Okay. I want to zoom out a little bit and another theme that came up a bunch when I ask people about you and how you think is that you have a really strong feeling that building great product and building successful product is a moral obligation of people that are in tech. Talk about why you feel that way and what that even means.

Bob Baxley (00:45:45):
Well, look, the example I use mostly is if you go to an airport and you look around, you'll see a lot of people using their phone to navigate that system. They're trying to figure out where their gate is, what time their flight's on, whether or not... Can they pull up their boarding pass, et cetera. And just watch people, watch their faces, watch the level of confusion and frustration. Some of them are tech superheroes like you and me and most of your listeners, but a lot of them are just mere mortals and they're not living and breathing this stuff all the time. And a lot of times they're super frustrated and then take that and scale it out to their entire day. And almost everyone living in a modern economy now is going to have hundreds of interactions with the phone or with a computer. And a lot of those interactions are going to be consequential.

(00:46:27):
Unfortunately, a lot of those interactions are not going to be great. They're going to be confusing and frustrating. When I'm speaking to live audiences, I often ask people, okay, please raise your hand if you've had a frustrating or confusing experience with software in the last month? And obviously every hand goes up. Okay, how about so far this week? Most all hands stay up. I'm like, okay, how about so far today? And most of the hands stay up, and it's often that I speak in the morning, I'm like, okay, everybody's had a frustrating experience with software and it's 10 o'clock in the morning. That's a problem, people, because each one of those interactions, it takes a little bit of energy away from you and it ramps your frustration just a little bit. And the bummer about software, both for the audience and for the creators is that it's an anonymous medium.

(00:47:10):
Nobody gets to see who's making these things. You and I together, we might be able to name six designers that have worked on products we care about. And the only reason we could do that is because a designer and I know a bunch of them. By yourself, I'd be surprised if you could name more than a handful. And again, we work in tech. So if you think about the billions of people out there that don't work in tech, to them, these products are just these crazy faceless things created by a bunch of people who knows where, and these products are causing them untold amounts of frustration and confusion, and it just takes away from their life quality. And I think we have an obligation as product people to put that emotional energy back into people's lives. They don't want to try to figure out how to navigate our login screens or go through our onboarding process, they just want to get home and spend time with their families and pet their dogs and have a nice dinner.

(00:48:02):
I just think every time we make a demand on the audience, that's a failure on our part. And so I do think it comes... I cast it in a moral way, and I talk about it that way because I don't think many people working in the industry understand the scale of what they're doing, again, because it's an anonymous field. We never see anybody on the other side of the glass.

(00:48:22):
But I think with this podcast, it'll go out to, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of people. If you and I saw all the people that will potentially listen to this in one place, we would think to ourselves, oh my goodness, that's like a lot of people. And we might think of it differently. We might behave differently. My team at Apple, but also my friends that are working at Facebook or Google or wherever, it's very hard to really understand that they're creating something in Figma on their computer that's going to be interacted with by billions of people, thousands and thousands of times. If you lose sight of that I think just, I don't know, you get sloppy and disrespectful is the wrong word, but I think you just lose sight of how much impact you're having on other people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:06):
Wow, that's really inspiring. That makes me want to build products and make them awesome. There's so much power to that. What this makes me think about a little bit is kind of random, but when I see someone click and watch one of my podcast videos on YouTube, I'm like, wow, that's one person that's going to spend their time watching this thing. Wow, I really want to make... It gives me more motivation to make these even better and better.

Bob Baxley (00:49:31):
Yeah, look, I think you have to find ways to go... You have to find where you go out of your way to see people using software in real time. I've worked on products that have been used by billions of people. I have friends who have touched billions of people. None of us ever get to see anybody use this stuff in the wild, in their natural state. Maybe we see them in a lab or something like that, but I've never seen anybody just randomly using even Pinterest. But there's ways that you can go and as a creator, as a maker, you can go and watch people using software in the wild. So just go observe people going through self-checkout at Target, which is the best self-checkout I've ever seen. Go watch that, then go watch it at some other grocery store where it's not as great and really notice what happens with people.

(00:50:11):
Much to my kids' frustration when their friends are over, I often grab their friend's phone and just sort of flip through it to try to understand how people are organizing their home screens and which apps they use. And maybe there's something in there that I haven't seen, I'll ask them what that is and ask them to give me a tour of it. I think we're living in a time where people don't do so many usability studies, so a lot of folks get pretty far into their careers without ever having watched mere mortals actually use software. Instead, we're relying on metrics and stuff, which I sort of joked that relying on metrics to understand what's happening at the user level is like looking at raw data from a radio telescope instead of just going out inside and looking at the night sky. You got to find a way to watch the audience.

(00:50:54):
Filmmakers can go to a theater, they can watch people, understand stuff. Comedians can go to a comedy club, they can start to develop an intuition about why people laugh. None of us have an obvious way to go watch people use software, so we don't really understand how humans process what's happening on the screen. And you have to just find ways to do that. And fortunately, software is everywhere. It's not just desktop or mobile software. I mean, there's ATM machines, there's ticketing kiosks, there's point of sale systems everywhere. I mean, go watch somebody over 70 fumble with a chip card insert or watch somebody try to figure out Apple Pay. And these are pretty seamless experiences and still there's cognitive friction in all this stuff. Just go rent a car and notice how long it takes you to figure out what the heck is going on with the dashboard. There's lots of opportunities to try to develop that intuition of how people navigate the human computer interaction, and we need to find ways to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:50):
An important element of what you're describing here, which I think maybe people miss, is that you're talking about just any software, not your own product, in order to start building your sense of taste and gut feeling for what-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:00):
Building your sense of taste and gut feeling for what works and doesn't work. And I had a guest on recently, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, founder of Vercel, and he had a really great phrase of something they do at their company. They have this kind of mission of exposure hours. Increase your exposure hours to people using our product. And then you can extrapolate that to any product.

Bob Baxley (00:52:26):
Yeah, well there's using your product, but I always think when you're watching somebody use your product, you come into it with a psychological bias that makes it hard for you to really see what's going on. So there's something about just understanding the audience and how they process information on a screen, not your product.

(00:52:40):
At one point when I was redesigning a checkout system, we did what I called a reality check, which was we held a traditional usability style exercise in a lab and all that sort of stuff, but we had the subjects come through and go through checkout in other products. So we watched them go through eBay and Williams-Sonoma and Amazon or something like that. And we learned a ton about checkout, about what was important to them, how it turns out ship quote is almost as important as price. Things that if we had been watching them use our own product, I'm not sure we would've picked up on, because we would've been sitting there yelling at them to click on the button. Or we would've had a bias and wanting to see the positive things. Whereas, if you just watch people that are using adjacent products could be super useful.

(00:53:22):
And again, we work in a medium, software is a medium, and we need to understand our medium in the same way. Again, musicians go to concerts, filmmakers go to movies, comedians go to comic clubs. When do people like you and I go watch people just use software? Where do we develop that intuition? And unfortunately I think you have to go out of your way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:42):
Talk about more about this idea that software is a medium. This is something that came up a bunch also in conversations with folks that have worked with you, that this is something that you believe.

Bob Baxley (00:53:51):
Yeah, you're so good with the research, Lenny. Yeah, look, so I left Pinterest in 2016, sorry, 2016. And I didn't have anything lined up so I had some time to myself and I was driving up and down the peninsula here in Silicon Valley meeting with other design leaders and just sort of commiserating with people. And you may remember there was a very consequential presidential election in the United States in 2016 and there was some impression that social media had had a significant impact on that election.

(00:54:22):
So I was kind of driving around Silicon Valley and I was just sort of wondering what the heck happened. I moved here in 1990 when the hippie ethos that was really at the core of Silicon Valley, and the hippie ethos was still very visible, it was very much a part of what was interesting to me about the valley when I moved here. But 2016 is a long time later and that hippie ethos had gotten pretty quiet.

(00:54:45):
And so I was listening to a podcast about the history of Silicon Valley by a Stanford group. The podcast was called Raw Data, and it was season two. And it starts off with an episode called A Monument to a Dead Child, which is about Stanford University, and it ends with Zuckerberg's testimony in front of Congress. And in the middle of that, they start talking about the counterculture revolution in the late 1960s in San Francisco and elsewhere. And they quote this book by a guy named Fred Turner, I think it is, the book's called From Counterculture to Cyberculture. And he has this quote that is, "you have to ask why it is personal computing got started in Northern California in the late 1960s when at the time every major tech company in the country was on the East Coast. And the answer is because there was a very small group of people in and around Stanford University that saw software as a new form of media on par with movies, music and books."

(00:55:41):
And when I heard that, all of a sudden I went, wait a second, boom. That is why I do this. I am fundamentally a maker. In high school I was a photographer, in college I was going to be a filmmaker, after college I went to music school. After music school I started a graphic design studio. I am a maker. And I realized looking back, I was just hunting for my medium. And it took me until I was 27 to find software as my medium. It's like, oh, I'm a maker that designs software.

(00:56:05):
And then when I heard that software as a medium, that whole concept of what I'd been doing with my life and who I was about, it just sort of all came together really quickly. And I realized, oh, I am into software because software makes me feel a certain way when it's working well. And what I find so troubling now is that a lot of time it's not working that way.

(00:56:27):
And I remember the first time I saw a computer, probably a lot of people on listening to the show can remember maybe the first time they saw a desktop computer, probably the first time they saw a pension zoom on a phone. You remember all that stuff. It was just freaking magic man. It was the future. It was so cool, and it just felt like the most amazing aurora borealis, or sunrise, or whatever. There was a sense of awe and wonder that filled me and probably a lot of listeners, that's probably the thing that motivated you to be in the field.

(00:56:58):
And so I realized software is a medium because there's an emotional component to it. Like a hammer and saw, they're not really pulling out an emotion for me. Maybe there's some, if you're a carpenter, but I don't naturally have an emotion with kitchen tools or things that I think even more sophisticated tools like calculators and pulleys, I still don't have an emotional response to them. But every piece of software I have an emotional response to. I either feel confused or empowered. I feel like my world's gotten bigger or my world's gotten smaller. They all have an emotional component. And I think once you realize and accept that, then you can say, oh, there is an emotional component to what we're doing with this product. I could just leave that to chance, which is what most people do, or I could try to be conscious of it and we could try to bring that into our conception of what the product's about and try to be purposeful in the emotion we're trying to elicit from the user. And I think that's where design and particularly visual design can have a huge impact.

(00:57:58):
So again, in many conversations that I'd have in design reviews, some executive would go, "I don't know, ultimately this just kind of comes down to a matter of opinion." And I was always like, "no, it does not. Whether we choose blue or red is going to elicit a certain emotional response from the user. What is it we want them to feel? And then let's make sure that we design something visually that evokes that emotion."

(00:58:21):
So again, I think once you really get your head around the fact that there are people on the other side of the glass, real live human beings having emotional moments with the thing that you're putting in their hand and that they're focusing their attention on. You are in those moments. And are you going to own it and show up and be the person you want to be in those moments or not?

(00:58:44):
A few months ago, I guess a little longer ago, I was talking to the team at Toast who makes the handheld point of sale stuff that they use in restaurants. And the thing I was trying to tell them, is whether or not you see it, tonight, you're going to be at dinner with a few 100 000 people all across the country. And if we take just one example, you're going to be at a very nice diner with a grandmother and her two teenage sons in Ohio, and the check's going to come and the waiter, the waitress is going to hand over the device to that grandmother, because she wants to pick up the bill. And you have the opportunity to either make her look like a superhero, because she knows what she's doing, or to make her look like a fool and one of her teenage grandsons is going to grab the device and do it for her.

(00:59:24):
You're at the dinner table, what are you going to do for grandma? You going to show up as well as you can, or are you going to just let this whole thing fall apart, because you didn't think hard enough about grandma? And that's true for Toast, that's true for every product any of us are working on all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):
This is so interesting and fascinating and inspiring. I was going to ask how you use this insight, that software is kind of the most powerful medium media more than even than TV and movies, and you shared it, which I think is really important. So just to kind of double-down on this, is the advice here is think about the emotion you want the user of your software to have as you're starting the design process, not just what do you want them to do, how fast do you want them to get to this flow, it's what's the emotion you want them to have?

Bob Baxley (01:00:09):
Yeah. I often don't think about what I want them to do. I just think that's sort of a selfish way to think about it. They have something they want to do. I'm trying to help them. I just don't ever approach these things of the user's something for me to exploit and take advantage of and manipulate. I know there's people that do approach it that way, which I think is a little unfortunate. But as a designer, I guess I have my own set of values and my own kind of compass on these things that's pushed me in a certain way of thinking about it. And so I'm kind of constantly asking what's the right thing for the user?

(01:00:44):
And I believe in my heart that if we prioritize that wonderful things will happen for all the metrics, including the money metrics that matter. I've never seen a product be successful that used metrics as a driver for what they were doing. I've seen a lot of companies be really successfully seeing metrics as a consequence and a way to evaluate the quality of their decisions, and then using those to triangulate and make better decisions moving forward. So they're kind of a very useful feedback mechanism. But I think there's definitely a risk to confusing, doing something because it's a driver versus something as a consequence.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:20):
There's a few more questions I would ask, but I want to come back to something that I asked earlier, that I think is on the minds of a lot of say founders and product managers listening to this. I'm just like, okay, this all is sounds really great. I would love to make these experiences so great. It's going to take us a lot of time to do this really, really well. You said that it doesn't have to. What's a tactical tip or two that you can suggest to a founder or product manager to help them contain the design process while also achieving these outcomes that you're describing?

Bob Baxley (01:01:53):
Well, I think if you can give... Maybe one way to think about it is like a big giant AI prompt. The more context you can give it, the more specificity you can give it, the more this is what I'm about and what we're trying to get to, the more the designer's going to be able to figure out which swim lane they're supposed to be in to produce something.

(01:02:10):
So I think if you're going into it feeling like the design process is going to take a lot of time, it's because you haven't been clear in your creative brief, so to speak, which often means you're not really clear in your own head. And I think... I have worked with a lot of founders, and we could identify a bunch of big companies, who I think got started that weren't clear in their own head. I don't want to... Yahoo was an amazing company, but if we just look at Yahoo for a second, I worked there, it was never clear to me what the founding vision of Yahoo was.

(01:02:39):
And I talk a lot about vision statements and we could say the vision statement of Google is organizing all the world's information. That's a great vision. They'll never achieve that. That's something that's always over the horizon. And it's been a very useful organizing principle for their acquisitions and how the company grows.

(01:02:55):
Amazon to be the Earth's most customer-centric company. Okay, great. That's a vision, they will never get there. It tells you how they're going to expand. Apple doesn't have an explicit vision, but I might describe it as personal computing can have a transformative effect on the lives of individuals. And I think that kind of focuses a lot of what they're trying to do.

(01:03:14):
Disneyland, still the best vision statement of all time, which is the happiest place on earth. So once you tell an employee this is supposed to be the happiest place on earth, then you're signaling all sorts of things about how they need to pick up the trash and how they need to show up on time and how they need to wear their uniform. You're just signaling a whole bunch of stuff.

(01:03:33):
So when I talked to founders, a lot of times they just don't have that clarity of what's the vision of the company. And to go back to Yahoo for a second, I never heard of vision. And so I'm not really sure what they were ever about. They kind of stumbled into the directory and then they added a bunch of stuff around the edges, but it never seemed to make a lot of sense. And so I think people operating inside Yahoo, it ended up being inefficient, because they were having to deal with all that ambiguity.

(01:03:54):
So I think that that can also be a pretty big risk for founders. They end up caught up with a product idea, and they think that the company is the product, the company is not the product. The product is the product and the company's bigger than the product. And you need to have some vision that speaks beyond just this particular thing.

(01:04:12):
I think Slack, honestly, both Slack and Pinterest I think are examples of products that became companies, but neither one of those places really knew what to do next, because they didn't have a bigger vision of the change they were trying to see in the world. So back to you, you were asking a very pragmatic question. I think you need to work on your prompt before you go to your designers and try to give them as much clarity about what you want to produce as possible. And I think if you leave it open as to the emotional response you want users to have, you're inviting a lot of ambiguity, which is going to invite a lot of inefficiency.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
I love that answer. And it's so interesting that AI can help us work better together as humans, because when you find that the AI is not achieving the outcome you want as effectively as you want, that's a lesson. This also translates the working with humans, make the prompt more specific, add more context in life, not just when you're talking to AI.

Bob Baxley (01:05:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:13):
I love that. That's so interesting. So the advice here is, if you're finding design is taking too long or you want to just level up your success with your design team, give more context, spend more time on the brief, on what you're actually trying to achieve. And make sure there's a clear vision or mission that everyone can row towards.

Bob Baxley (01:05:32):
Yeah. Look, design is a problem solving methodology. So the more variables you can remove before they go into the process, the more efficient it's going to be. And if you give designers a lot of ambiguity, they're going to spend a lot of time spinning around, and honestly, that's your fault as the client.

(01:05:48):
As a design leader, I think one of my main challenges is frankly trying to make the PMs better clients, helping them get more specific. It's very common for a design team to get extremely ambiguous asks from a product team. And the problem for designers, they have to take all that ambiguity and they've got to wring it all out. So when they give it to engineering, engineering knows exactly what to code, because computers don't tolerate ambiguity. Engineers need to know what the thing's going to be. And so design gets stuck with a really ambiguous input, but they have to have a highly specific output and then often timeboxed to do that. And it's just not a recipe for success.

(01:06:26):
So you're much better off either kind of compressing the PRD experience and bringing the designers into that, kind of co-creating with product and design really rapidly. But you need to... You could think of it in some ways as designers are going to draw the storyboards, and if you don't give them a great script, they're going to have a very hard time. And then you can't give the shooting crew ambiguous storyboards or you're just going to waste untold amounts of money on set.

(01:06:51):
So if you think about those three steps from script to storyboard to production, it's all about getting rid of ambiguity. And so the more ambiguity that can be removed upstream, the faster design's going to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:03):
This begs the question then, you don't want to give designers here exactly. Here's the thing we're designing, make it really great and pretty. There's always this balance of just give designers space to think and be creative and explore. Advice there of just how to navigate that.

Bob Baxley (01:07:20):
Well, if you go back to my example of the script and storyboard, scripts don't contain pictures, there's still a lot of opportunity to think differently and to come up with original things and to have a lot of creative input in the storyboarding process. So the script is living mostly in words, which is largely how PMs function.

(01:07:39):
The thing that I will say, to keep in mind for PMs, there's always a tendency on PMs to want to draw something and then try to give a sketch to a designer. And I would caution them against that. Sometimes they have to draw themselves so they can think it out. But if a PM came to me with something that was drawn and kind of fully baked, my response was like, thanks for giving me that. Now I know exactly what we're not going to do. Because as a point of pride, there's no way I'm going to go execute that exact thing.

(01:08:09):
So you're right, PMs have to give you the space to operate. And I think a lot of what they're trying to achieve could be done in more informal ways, conversationally and whiteboards, things like that. But yet you need to narrow the problem for the designers, they need constraints. They don't need a tiny little box, but they need constraints. Think in terms of, you don't give them an airport tarmac and you don't even give them a football field. You give them something more like a basketball court, a sort of scale at which they can do their design thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:45):
I want to talk about basketball later, but not yet. You've shared a lot of counterintuitive lessons on building product, designing, building teams, leadership. Is there another very counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products, hiring leading teams that goes against common startup wisdom?

Bob Baxley (01:09:04):
The thing I would say is that you should wait as long as possible to draw a picture. I think that pushes against all the gen AI tools that help you create prototypes. And there's obviously a lot of excitement around that. I can just give a prompt and the AI, they're going to crank out of UI for me.

(01:09:21):
So I don't think I'm using the term right, but I had this idea from art that I call the primal mark, and that's the first mark that you make on the canvas. And once you make that mark on the canvas, everything you do after that is in response to that mark. It sort of sets your baseline. And so for me, I always felt that as soon as we drew a picture that looked even remotely real, everybody gravitated towards that and said, oh, that's the thing. And people were so uncomfortable with ambiguity that they can't really deal with the tension of, well, that might not be the thing.

(01:09:53):
And so as soon as you draw a picture that looks even slightly realistic, much less something that comes out of one of these gen AI tools, everybody kind of goes, oh, that's the thing. You just keep doubling down on that thing. And what's happened is you've taken the possibilities from this big broad thing down to this tiny little thing from an AI system that's trained on existing solutions and existing ideas and is maybe not even thinking about it the right way, because all you've really given it is your first-order of thinking.

(01:10:22):
I think there's a way you can stay in these things conceptually and conversationally, where you can get to your second, third, fourth idea. And that's where stuff gets really interesting. And again, I don't think that has to take a lot of time. That can be over the course of a single meeting, you could get to a second, third, fourth idea. You just have to be willing to not jump at the first thing that looks like a possibility. You get that possibility, you go, okay, well that's interesting, let's table that. What else have we got?

(01:10:47):
There's one story that kind of related that's useful. In one of my previous jobs, I was responsible for the public website. I remember coming across one of the product managers one day and she's like, "Hey, this link on the home page, we have to make it blue." I was like, "Well, we don't use blue links anywhere." And she said, "Yeah, yeah, but we just have to make it blue." I was like, "Well, we're not making it blue." And a couple of days go by and I saw the home page and the link had been made blue, because she had got around me and she'd gone to engineering and just made it blue.

(01:11:11):
And I saw her in the hallway again. I was like, "What the hell's up with that?" And she goes, "Well, people couldn't see it." And I'm like, "Oh, they couldn't see it, so it wasn't prominent enough, right?" She's like, "Yeah, it wasn't prominent enough." I'm like, "Well, great. There's a 100 different things we could do to make it more prominent, one of which is making it blue, which is the thing that came to you first because you're not a designer, it's naturally... Because it's the most obvious thing, but it actually doesn't fit in with these larger things we're trying to do."

(01:11:36):
So I've often... I try to encourage the product managers to what's the problem with the thing? And then let us solve it. Don't jump to it and tell us... Don't tell us this is just exactly what we're supposed to do. And again, I do the same thing on the roadmap. You decide the roadmap, tell us what we're supposed to do, I will ask you about it, and I may push back and we may have some back and forth, but that's your responsibility. I'm going to trust that you are trained and you know what you're doing and you're going to make the right call. And I just want you to give me the same level of respect.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:06):
This advice about not drawing quickly and not making that primal mark, which I love that term, is, I'm curious your take on AI prototyping tools these days. Because that's the extreme version of that. Not only are you just creating a sketch, it's like, oh, it's working, here it is. Here's what it looks like. Thoughts on that, do you discourage people from doing that, PMs especially?

Bob Baxley (01:12:27):
Well, I think it's a production tool. Once you know what you want and you can give it a really robust prompt, then... I haven't played with it a lot myself, because I'm not in an operational role right now, but presumably it's really useful at cranking out that actionable prototype which you can click and experience.

(01:12:43):
And I've said for a long time that an interactive idea needs to be expressed interactively, so we're not talking with our hands and we can really understand what's going to happen. So when the idea is ready to be expressed, I think those tools are probably fantastic. But ideas start off pretty fragile, and the best ideas start off really fragile. And I think when you push them to develop too quickly and you put them out in the world and expect them to be able to stand up to critique too early, you're just going to squash them.

(01:13:10):
I often think about them like the little plant in the Pixar movie, Wall-E, you've got to give that little guy a little space, a little time, some water and some nourishment, and you can't really just suddenly put him out in the wind and think he's going to make it. And so I think a lot of... There's a lot of very fragile, interesting, quiet ideas that I think you need to give some space. And when you jump to the expression of them, I think you're putting them at risk.

(01:13:33):
I'll also say that, everybody, when they look at a prototype, what they're focusing on is the visual and textual expression. And so as soon as you produce something in high resolution the feedback you're going to get is going to be about colors and shapes and these presentation layer things, which are very loosely related to usability and value. It's like focusing on the special effects of a movie that has a really bad story.

(01:13:59):
And so at ThoughtSpot, we used to use what we call block brain diagrams, which were even simplified versions of wire frames. It was just big chunky blocks of here's how the screen could be and where things might be located. And because it was so low fidelity, people couldn't get into commenting on what it looked like. We had to talk about conceptually what it was. And so we were trying to build up this firm foundation where we could go from the block frames to wire frames to kind of the final expression.

(01:14:24):
And I think it helped us clarify what we were trying to do conceptually so that by the time we got to the final visual presentation, that stuff was actually really simple. And initially it made the product team really nervous because we would be sitting in these block frames and wire frames for sometimes weeks, and they'd be like, when are we finally going to see the comps?

(01:14:42):
And then what would happen, is because we had such a robust design system, once we locked down on the block frames, we could send it to an agency and they could do the full high-res comps in a day, because they knew exactly what they were doing. And so the PMs were always like, what the hell happened overnight? You're like, well, it turns out that the high-res stuff, that's not the hard thing. The hard thing is the heavy lifting of thinking, what are we really trying to do? That's the hard part.

(01:15:06):
And if you do the high-res stuff, you really muddy the waters. And I think you end up spending a lot more time churning, if you didn't... Again, I'm going to go back to the movie metaphor, because I studied film. If you're trying to fix script issues when you're in production or storyboarding, you're going to churn and you're going to waste a lot of effort. So you've got to figure out what you're trying to do before you go draw the high-res stuff. And I think a lot of the gen AI tools, it's this seductive thing of, hey, let's just go, let's go make the comp and see what we think. I don't really know if you're going to get anything great out of that process, maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:42):
That's a really interesting counter-narrative because it feels like every team now is just straight to prototypes. I just had the C... She's one of the CPOs at Microsoft. I realize there's many CPOs, and she has this concept of demos before memos and just prompt sets or any PRDs, you should just be prototyping all your ideas. And so it's interesting to hear the perspective of maybe it's actually hurting your ability to come up with a really clever solution versus the obvious solution.

Bob Baxley (01:16:10):
Yeah. Look, I think at some point, hopefully people just back up and ask themselves, are we actually producing better product because of this process? And we're going faster, but faster can't be the ultimate goal. You need to be creating something great as well, right? Something that's sustainable and frankly that you're proud of and your users find value in. And if you're just throwing so much spaghetti at the wall, I don't know if having a spaghetti throwing machine that goes faster is...

(01:16:35):
Look, there's a counter argument that's... You can say, oh, it's like Darwinian evolution, and we're just going to spin through a bunch of random mutations and see what happens. And I used to joke that it's true, that if you take a bunch of hydrogen atoms and give them 14 billion years, you could end up with a tiger, but you don't know you're going to get a tiger and you could get a six headed shrimp instead, and you don't really know when it's going to shift. So I'm not exactly sure Darwinian evolution is the way we create great product, but a lot of companies are making a run at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):
I want to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast called AI Corner. And in AI Corner, I ask guests to share what's one way that you've learned or figured out to use AI in your job to help you do better work, to help you do faster work?

Bob Baxley (01:17:17):
Well, my job right now is trying to figure out what my job is. And so the thing I've been using AI for is I've very explicitly been using it as a life coach. And so I had seen a couple of prompts about asking it what a blind spot was or what my strengths and weaknesses were. I'd seen some prompts about that stuff.

(01:17:34):
And one of them was really fantastic. One of them was, what's an outdated mindset that I'm holding onto that's not still serving me? And it came back with a very polite prompt or very polite response about, well, given your age and your profession, it's not surprising that you're very wedded to the idea of control, but that's not really the world we're living in anymore. And that's not probably going to suit the thing you're trying to do next, which is writing and publishing and speaking and stuff. And although it's statistically derived, it did come back with a really nice phrase, which I view...

Bob Baxley (01:18:00):
Although it's statistically derived, it did come back with a really nice phrase which I've used in your show, which was, try to focus on choreography over control.

(01:18:08):
And so I thought that was really useful. I asked for some of my blind spots, that was also useful. I use it for a lot of exercise input, that's useful. And the exercise that I've gone through most recently was I realized that it was inferring these things about me from the things that I had asked it to help me with in the past.

(01:18:26):
So instead, I just switched. I just went to ChatGPT, start a new project and said, I want you to be my life coach. I want you to ask me five questions a day for the next five days. Let's go through those so you can explicitly become better at helping me with this task.

(01:18:40):
And so we've just gone through that process and it's been really useful for me. It's no substitute for a therapist or a real coach or anything like that. It's not a human being. It doesn't care about me. I'm not saying that you should use it instead of these other options. You need a human being as well. But it's been very good at reflecting back to me things that I think have been floating around in my undermind.

(01:19:03):
So there's a wonderful book called Hair Brain Tortoise Mind by a gentleman named Guy Claxton. In that, he talks about the undermind. And sometimes you might've heard this as your unconscious or something like that. But I think of your undermind as the part of your brain that's processing information before it gets to language. And then when you go to consciousness, you've turned it into language.

(01:19:25):
And language isn't the full universe of things you can think, language is what you can think in English. And if you talk to multilingual speakers, they'll tell you that they can think things in other languages than what they can think in English.

(01:19:35):
So if you only speak English, you're only in one vein of what you could think, but your undermind is operating through all this other stuff. And for the computer nerds out there, you could think about it as a compiled code versus interpreted code.

(01:19:46):
So your undermind work in a compiled code and it could do a lot of stuff that you can't really do in the interpreted code which moves slower and has different orientations and we call that consciousness.

(01:19:56):
So I was feeding ChatGPT all this stuff over the last year or so, and there are all these patterns in my undermind that had been going into that I wasn't able to express with conscious language.

(01:20:08):
And so when I started asking it questions, I think what it was doing was it was statistically reflecting patterns back to me that already existed in my undermind, but because it was putting them into language, my conscious mind could now recognize them and respond to them.

(01:20:21):
And so again, as a life coach, I found it very useful as a mirror back to things that I was probably already thinking. And it helped me clarify my thoughts. It's not pushing me in new directions that a human might do, but it's still been super useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:38):
That is extremely cool. That is a really cool use case. I don't know if you've heard the Jerry Colona episode that I did recently. Okay, we'll link to it. He's got four questions that he suggests people ask themselves.

(01:20:50):
The first is the title of the actual episode, how are you complicit in creating the conditions you say you don't want? And this often leads to a lot of interesting insights about yourself, and there's an important part of it, complicit being like you're not responsible, but you're actually helping achieve a thing.

Bob Baxley (01:21:07):
It's a powerful word. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:09):
And then also it's an important element of say you don't want, you say you don't want to be busy, but something you just keep creating busyness for yourself, maybe you do want this. So anyway, we'll link to that episode. There's a lot of good stuff there.

Bob Baxley (01:21:21):
Yeah, that's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:23):
Okay, one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. This is one that I don't think you have any idea I'm going to ask you about. And so I'm curious where this goes.

(01:21:32):
This is a story that Joff Redfern suggested. I ask you. He told me that you're obsessed with space. You love researching space, telling stories about space. There's a story that you share about this guy named John Hobolt. Does that ring a bell?

Bob Baxley (01:21:49):
Oh yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):
Okay. Share that story because I think there's something really powerful here for people building products.

Bob Baxley (01:21:55):
So I should clarify, I am a fan of astronomy and space, but I'm a particular fan of the Apollo program because I view the Apollo program and the moon landings as the greatest peacetime accomplishment of mankind ever.

(01:22:06):
And I think it's an incredible... There's a profound number of leadership lessons and individual lessons to be learned from that program. And I've done multiple talks about this. I could go on for hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
Let's do it. Here we go.

Bob Baxley (01:22:22):
The particular question you're asking is John Hobolt. So, John was, I can't remember exactly where he was at the NASA hierarchy, but he was one of the people that was tasked with figuring out the question of how do you go to the moon?

(01:22:34):
So just to take yourself back in history a little bit, John Kennedy, president Kennedy goes to Rice University, I believe it's 19 September or May 1962, he gives the famous moon speech, we choose to go to the moon not because it's easy, but because it is hard, that whole thing, which I also have to say, and maybe a link to this in the show notes as well, everyone should go watch that talk. That is the perfect Ted talk.

(01:22:54):
It clocks in right at 18 minutes. It shows you how to sell a big, giant, bold vision. The specifics that Kennedy gets into the way he sets context at the beginning, the technical problems are going to happen, how much money it's going to cost, the way he puts the passion, why we're going to go to the moon, the whole thing.

(01:23:09):
It is an incredible talk. It's the only moonshot talk ever because a moonshot has to actually go to the moon. And so it is an incredible talk. So go watch the talk. But he steps off the stage and people at NASA are like, we've only recently put Alan Shepard into space.

(01:23:27):
And he just went up and went down. That was almost like it was a blue origins type thing that was just up and down. We didn't even do a lap around the earth like the Russians did with Yuri Gagarin. And now we're talking about going to the moon. Nobody knows how to go to the moon.

(01:23:40):
And there was three different options for going to the moon, one at the time, one was to build a big giant rocket and just go straight to the moon. It's called direct ascend. And the main advocate for that was Warner von Braun, who was the main rocket guy in the world. A little bit of a complicated past.

(01:23:53):
But nevertheless, Warner von Braun's a big guy. He is, got the president's ear. He's like, let's build a big giant rocket, go to the moon. People are like, yeah, the problem is when you get to the moon, the rocket's still super big. So these guys are going to have to descend a big ladder. That's a problem. So that was one idea.

(01:24:07):
There was another called Earth Orbit Rendezvous where you spend two spacecraft into Earth and then you link them up in Earth orbit and then one of them goes off to the moon, but you still got to land that thing on the moon.

(01:24:18):
And then there's a third idea called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, which is where you build a spacecraft that includes a smaller spacecraft. So you send up two spacecraft together, one of them's smaller, much lighter, and you use that just as the ship that goes down to the moon's surface and back up.

(01:24:31):
And that spacecraft is truly a spacecraft. It only flies in space, which means the engineering requirements around it are profoundly different because it doesn't have to survive re-entry into the earth. And so as a result, it can be much lighter.

(01:24:45):
And it turns out that the whole problem of landing on the moon is it's a weight problem. You got to lift all the stuff off the earth, which is incredibly expensive for fuel. You got to land it on. There's just a lot goes on. And so Hubert had come across this paper from a gentleman named Yuri Kondrachev who was living in Ukraine in the 1916, 1918 when he wrote this paper.

(01:25:05):
And he was the first guy to theorize Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. And I try to take people back to that. You and I can think about going to the moon, but Yuri Kondrachev in 1918 is on the plains of Ukraine looking at the moon, and he's actually thinking about how to really go to the moon.

(01:25:23):
He's figuring it out. And so he writes this paper, John discovers it years later, and John's trying to sell Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. It's not going over at NASA. And so eventually he decides to go around all the hierarchy and he sends a very famous memo to one of the top guys at NASA.

(01:25:39):
The memo starts somewhat as a voice in the wilderness and then it goes on. And then there's points in there where he's really emphatic, do we want to go to the moon or not? And then he goes through all the math of how going to the moon is all about weight and this was the only way to do it, and there was no other option, stuff like that.

(01:25:54):
He just made the case and he risked his whole career. The whole thing could have blown up. He could have been fired for going around the hierarchy and all that sort of stuff, but of course, he's able to champion the idea.

(01:26:04):
And I think it was another year or so after that famous memo, which you could read online, it's nine pages long or something. After the memo, it was still some time before they adopted Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, but eventually they do. And even with Don brought himself was very complimentary to ALT for pushing that perspective.

(01:26:21):
So I tell the story, one, because it's just amazing story and it does force you to go back to the moment of like, wait, they didn't actually know how to do it. We only know how to do it now because they've done it. But there's that moment of uncertainty and I think you have to embrace and be amazed at that.

(01:26:41):
And it also shows you the power of these ideas. A really great idea somehow finds a way to live on somehow it just sits out there and it just waits for its time. And Yuri had brought this idea into the world and it just sat around and then somebody it and dusted it off and was able to push for it and it came through.

(01:26:58):
Then maybe the third lesson is ideas need champions. They need champions willing to put themselves on the line for them. If you believe in something and you've made your case and you can really make your case, have the courage of your convictions and get behind it and fight as hard as you can for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:15):
Such a great story. I love that you summarize the takeaways too, by the way. So to me, the takeaways and the lessons here is one is coming back to your Pinterest board in the office, say the hard thing.

(01:27:28):
Two is be patient. It may take a little bit of time for a radical idea, especially to resonate and stick and get adoption. So if you're pitching a big new product idea, don't assume that they'll immediately agree. Also, just this idea of if you really believe in it, do go and champion it. There needs to be someone passionately arguing for this.

Bob Baxley (01:27:49):
Yeah, I'll just add to that one thing. I think people need to understand that they're advocating for ideas and not for themselves. And when I talk to a lot of designers that may be true for PMS, I hear a lot of people say that they're reluctant to post on social media or on LinkedIn or something because like, "Well, I don't want to be self-promoting."

(01:28:06):
And I try to counsel them like, look, it's not about self-promotion. There are ideas that you care about that you want to see succeed in the world. And so get out there as an advocate of the idea. It's not about you, it's about the idea. And don't be afraid to stand behind the idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):
We've spread a lot of good ideas in this conversation, Bob. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Bob Baxley (01:28:33):
Yeah, let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):
We added a ding to this. I like that drama you added and there's a whole thing now. Okay, first question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Bob Baxley (01:28:44):
So the three books I'm going to recommend, the first one's a beautiful poetic book about typography called The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst. Robert was the poet laureate of Canada. And the first 80 pages will change how you think about typography.

(01:28:59):
It will open you up to the wonderful world of typography that we all live in. You'll think differently about every sign you look at, about every movie credit you see, and it will give you an insight into the designer mindset. When you understand typography, I think you understand where designers come from and the best designers I know are just total type nerds. So highly recommend Elements of Typographic Style.

(01:29:23):
Second book, Zen and the Motorcycle Maintenance. Many people may know ultimately a philosophy book, but it's about the concept of quality, which I think is a very important topic. So it talks about quality and the importance of how things integrate into cohesive whole, which I believe is the main challenge facing most software teams. They create something that's highly fragmented instead of a single hole. So, Zen in the Motorcycle Maintenance.

(01:29:46):
And then the last one is a book called Time in the Art of Living by Robert Gruden. It's just a very interesting collection of impressionistic views of time and how time passes and what time means. So that's very different from the others and it's not something probably gets recommended on your show too often, but I think it'll help people in their lives in a powerful way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:10):
I think these are all brand new entries in this question. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Bob Baxley (01:30:19):
So I really enjoyed Severance. I enjoyed it as a filmmaker. I was just blown away at the filmmaking. I was intrigued with the story and the characters. And I think as someone who's worked in corporate America, when you understand that it's basically critique and commentary about the modern workplace.

(01:30:35):
There were times that I just thought were unbelievably funny and insightful. It was definitely interesting watching it with my wife who was an attorney and hasn't worked in those kinds of environments. So it was like an episode where some people got disappeared and the language that we're using was all around the language you would hear around a layoff.

(01:30:50):
And so I was laughing myself to death, but she was like, "What? What's going on?" So that's super fascinating and then I'll throw one other in there, which is not something I've recently seen, but something I highly recommend for everybody, which is Lords of Arabia. The Lords of Arabia is I think one of the two or three best expressions of the medium of film.

(01:31:11):
And so when you think about the ability to hold moving pictures, characters, story, music, photography, set design, costume, the whole constellation of variables that come to play into a movie, I think Lords of Arabia is probably one of the two or three most complete expressions of what the medium is capable of.

(01:31:30):
And I think it's useful to think about in technology, all the different elements of a product and all the different elements of a user interface and how you can break those down the way you can break down all these elements of a movie and how many pieces of software do we use where somebody is actually conducting that symphony in a really coherent, powerful, full on way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:52):
I love that movie. Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love?

Bob Baxley (01:31:58):
You're focused on recent and I'm just going to push back. No, there's nothing terribly recent. The stuff that I go back to, I'll give you a couple of nerdy ones. I have a Leica M6 cam, which is a film camera, and I recently started shooting with film again, which I absolutely love because it forces me to slow down.

(01:32:14):
I always talk about Leica cameras, they're obscenely expensive, but the thing about Leica cameras is you show up different when you shoot with a Leica. So when people think about cameras, they think about the quality of the image, they don't think about how the tool is going to change them.

(01:32:28):
When you show up with an iPhone, you're thinking about sharing. When you show up with a film camera, you're thinking about saving film and you're spending more time composing and thinking exactly about the shot. When you show up with a digital SLR, you just take a whole bunch of pictures and hope something's going to turn out.

(01:32:42):
And so I think these cameras are very useful metaphor for being conscious about how the tools you pick are going to impact the thing that you produce. So once you go into Figma, you've made a decision about the thing you're going to produce. If you stay in a sketchbook, you've made a different decision. If you go into something else, you've made a different kind of decision.

(01:33:03):
So I say the Leica M6 with film because of that. And then the software product I would point out, which is not terribly new, but I think it's worth noting, is a tool called Habitica. And Habitica is really fascinating. Ultimately, it's a habit tracker and task management app, but it's fundamentally a game.

(01:33:21):
It's a role playing game where you create a character and your character revolves and can buy armor and go on quests and things as you check off your habits and stuff. And it is the most interesting expression of shifting conceptual models that I've ever seen.

(01:33:35):
So if you think about a conceptual model, it's sort of the software equivalent of a genre in a movie. And so once you say it's a project management software, you're in a certain genre. If you say it's a productivity tool, you're in a certain genre. So if it's social media, you're in a certain genre. So these are different genres.

(01:33:50):
And Habitica is really interesting because it mixes genres, it mixes role playing game with to do manager. And so I think it's a really powerful example of how you can really shift the user's thinking in the same way movies for example. Star Wars is ultimately a cowboy movie set in space.

(01:34:07):
And when you come to those two genre mashups are really interesting. When you come to a rom-com, you have a certain expectation of what's going to happen to a rom-com. If somebody suddenly got shot in a rom-com, that would not make sense to you in the same way that if somebody made a really funny joke in a John Wick movie, it wouldn't make sense.

(01:34:23):
So I think Habitica is just the most interesting example I've ever found is somebody really doing a fascinating mashup of conceptual models, which is... Sorry, I'll stop. It's an unexplored and unexploited possibility of software ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:38):
I love how profound this lightning round already is. The point about Leica changing the way you even think about the photo is so interesting, I've never thought of it that way. You mentioned Star Wars. Have you seen Andor by the way?

Bob Baxley (01:34:50):
No, but my wife, everybody's raving about it. I've been watching basketball, so I just haven't had the spare time yet. But okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:57):
I have a basketball question, but first of all, before we get to that, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work in life?

Bob Baxley (01:35:04):
Yeah, so there's three quotes that I come back to all the time that I repeat in most of my talks. First one I've already used, which is, design is clear thinking made visible, by Edward Tufte.

(01:35:14):
Second one is from the American landscape photographer, Ansel Adams. And I've also alluded to this and the quote is, there's nothing worse than a brilliant image of a fuzzy concept. And then the last one is an African proverb and it goes like this, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

(01:35:31):
And I think we've touched on all three of those things today when we've talked about the resolution of comps, we've talked about using gen AI to try to go faster, things like that. And those two ideas collide in interesting way.

(01:35:44):
People think if they cut their colleagues out of the pie, they can go faster. And it's true, they can go faster. You just can't go very far. You need a group if you want to go far. And just because you can create a brilliant image doesn't mean you got a good concept.

(01:35:58):
Go look on Instagram, you'll find plenty of photographs that tingle your senses from a visual perspective and you will forget them by the time you close the app because they don't mean anything. And so we live in a time when it's very easy to produce things at incredibly high production values, but they don't mean anything. And so they're just like fancy potato chips. There's no nourishment there, man.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:21):
I love that this connects back to the vibe coding apps and prototypes that people build, but you can do it really quickly, but it won't go too far, potentially, not to hit on those tools. They're amazing.

Bob Baxley (01:36:34):
They are. All this AI stuff is profoundly amazing and I will encourage people, one of the most amazing things for me about this moment in AI is that this, the kind of AI we're experiencing has been theorized for well over 50 years.

(01:36:46):
So there is a vast warehouse of interesting, amazing thoughts from philosophers and engineers and social scientists and people thinking about what is this moment going to mean when we have this sort of artificial intelligence that challenges our conception of what it means to be human.

(01:37:02):
So there's so much stuff you could be reading to help you process this moment in the very intense and profound psychological challenges it's bringing forth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:13):
It definitely feels like we're finally living in the future. The future's actually happening. It's going to be robots walking around soon. We get self-driving cars all over San Francisco and it's really stark.

Bob Baxley (01:37:22):
It's a future. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):
It's a future. Well, that's my concern with a lot of the fiction of the future is most of it is dystopian and here's all the problems that we're going to run into, which is going to be useful. Here's the robot laws that we got to be thinking about.

Bob Baxley (01:37:37):
Just to go back to this idea of how once you create an expression of something, people baseline off of it. I recently got to hear Henry Modisett who's head of design at Perplexity, give a talk. And one of the things he said that just really struck me was that people's conception of AI was founded, was put out there by Hollywood years ago.

(01:37:56):
So this idea that AI is going to take stuff over and is ultimately really dystopian and malevolent towards humans and stuff like that, it's actually something that's created by Hollywood and now we're trying to outlive how and stuff like that.

(01:38:11):
And so it's just such a great example of somebody put the concept out there and planted that seed in people's heads and now we're struggling to get people off that baseline and to look at it with fresh eyes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:24):
That's a really good point. It's much more entertaining to watch AI try to kill us all, not just, oh, everything's amazing. Great job, AI.

(01:38:34):
Okay, final question. I know you're a huge sports fan. In particular, you're a big Warriors fan. So let me just ask you this. Say you were running the Warriors, the owner of the Golden State Warriors, what would you change? What would you change to help them win?

Bob Baxley (01:38:49):
A real team can't be dependent on a single player. And I think there's such a dramatic difference in the Warriors when Steph is on the court and off the court. If you listen to the local announcers, they're always like, "These non-Steph minutes really matter."

(01:39:05):
I look at that, I'm like, that's not really a team then, right? That's Steph in the band of Merriman. And the Warriors are bigger than that and most of these basketball teams are bigger than that currently. I think across a lot of places in the NBA, there's a single player that can go down that makes a difference in the organization's success and that just seems dangerous and not a team.

(01:39:28):
So I don't know what to say. I don't know how you replace Steph Curry. He is a singular, if you even call him a generational player, it's a bit bigger than that. He is unequivocally the greatest shooter in the history of the game and he's one of only two or three players has actually fundamentally changed how the game's played.

(01:39:45):
But I just know for winning, the Warriors are at risk because Steph is meaningfully old for an NBA player and you can't have the whole franchise built around just him.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:58):
I love this hot take. A great way to end it, Bob. I can listen to you all day. This is so fun and interesting in so many ways on so many levels. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe learn more about what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Bob Baxley (01:40:14):
So, Bobbaxley.com is the easiest place right now. It's just a bento site, but I'll get some more stuff up there in the coming days, hopefully before this episode goes out. We'll see.

(01:40:21):
But there's plenty of links there that'll help you connect to me on LinkedIn and some of my talks and a few Links to some other things that I find useful. Just find me on LinkedIn. I publish pretty much every day on LinkedIn, so that's an easy way to find me.

(01:40:34):
I'm happy to be connected to whoever is interested in being connected. And then in terms of how you can help me, I'll go back to what I said earlier. It's not really about me, Lenny, it's about these ideas. It's about the idea that software matters, that we're making something for people on the other side of the glass and that it's a way that we show that we care and that we should care.

(01:40:52):
So it's not about me, it's about us together trying to create a digital world that we want to live in. The digital world right now, it's not something we really want to live in. It's not a place any of us would turn our kids loose in. You and I talked about this earlier. The digital world's not safe for our kids. Have we done something wrong? So I hope people take that responsibility more seriously and try to help clean things up a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:22):
I think we've made a dent in that. Bob, thank you so much for being here.

Bob Baxley (01:41:26):
Thank you so much, Lenny. It's been a real honor, privilege, and just a ton of fun. So thank you so much.

# Making Meta | Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (CTO)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
You were basically the 10th engineer at Facebook. I imagine there was a lot of pain and suffering that people don't often hear about.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:00:07):
I didn't sleep for more than four hours at a time. I'd wake up every four hours and check the report and see if anyone was attacking the site. They don't tell you about that stuff in the movies.

Lenny (00:00:14):
You worked 120 hours per week., you had no hobbies.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:00:17):
I don't want to take away from the romanticism of it. It's just that most often, we hear those romantic stories from the successes. It's a healthy thing for people to want to throw themselves into something and take that risk, but it is not glamorous at the time.

Lenny (00:00:29):
The newsfeed. That was one of your early projects at Facebook. People did not want it. They were wrong, clearly.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:00:33):
Now, newsfeed was an easier case than people suspect. Everyone was outraged at the same time as they immediately doubled their usage of the product.

Lenny (00:00:40):
In terms of the economic utility, the Venn diagram of Boz, of newsfeed and ads created $1 trillion of value.

(00:00:48):
Today, my guest is Andrew Bosworth, or Boz, as most people know him. Boz is the chief technology officer of Meta. He joined what was then called Facebook in early 2006 as one of the first engineers, and during his 18-year tenure at Meta, he created some of the most impactful and important products in internet history, including the Facebook newsfeed, which was the first ever algorithmically ranked content feed of any social network, and is basically what people think of as Facebook today.

(00:01:17):
He also built the original Facebook mobile ads platform, which he then ran for another four years. He also helped build and scale the Facebook messaging system, the profile, the timeline, Facebook groups, and even the internal engineering boot camp. Most recently, he served as VP of ads and business platform, where he led engineering product, research, analytics, and design. And in 2017, he created the company's AR/VR organization, now called Reality Labs.

(00:01:42):
These days, Andrew leads Meta's efforts in AR, VR and mixed reality, along with consumer hardware across Quest, Ray-Ban, Meta smart glasses, and more.

(00:01:52):
In our wide-ranging conversation, we touch on so many important lessons and stories, what it was really like in the early days of Facebook, why you should be asking your manager for help more often, why communication is the job. Lessons from Meta's turnaround over the past couple of years, Boz's thoughts on the Apple Vision Pro, a bunch of leadership and career advice, what it was like to build the very first newsfeed, and lessons from that experience, and stories of failure and stories of success, and so much more.

(00:04:47):
Boz, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:04:55):
Thanks for having me. I've been a long-time fan of your program and all the things that you've been putting out, so I'm glad to finally get a chance to join.

Lenny (00:05:01):
Same. I'm really excited to have you here. I have at least a billion questions I want to ask you. But I want to start with a few fun facts that I've found about you, and what if I go through them and then just pick one that stands out, and then tell the story behind it? How does that sound?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:17):
All right, sounds good.

Lenny (00:05:18):
Okay. You went to 14 proms.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:22):
Yeah. It's true.

Lenny (00:05:22):
Okay, I'm going to keep going. Okay.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:25):
Wow, that's a strong opener.

Lenny (00:05:27):
That might be the one. You were a national Taekwondo champion in college. You were Mark Zuckerberg's TA in college in a class on AI, which isn't actually how you landed at Facebook, from my understanding. Harvard was recruiting you to play football for them. You were very active in the 4-H Club, and you raised animals and showed them at county fairs when you were growing up. You once shared a stage with David Copperfield.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:52):
That's true.

Lenny (00:05:52):
MC Hammer once told you that your outfit was stylish. And president George W. Bush complimented you on your shoes and the shine of your head.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:06:03):
Yeah, these are all true. I want to say, wow. First of all, I got to make sure that people understand, I was a national collegiate champion, in as a green belt, which that's like being the JV champion. Just so everyone's clear on what that is.

Lenny (00:06:15):
W's a W.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:06:16):
Heavyweight sparring. I'll tell... The prom story is a funny one. It's related to the 4-H story. I was a big-time 4-H'er, National 4-H Hall of Fame, did all this stuff there.

(00:06:29):
As a comeup to that, 4-H is a wonderful program, youth program, it's coed program, and I was all over the state, all over the country, doing leadership events and doing these conferences, and doing a lot of public speaking.

(00:06:39):
And almost every 4-H event has a dance. People don't know that. At the end of a conference, at the end of the, literally camp, you'd go camping for a week, at the end there's a dance.

(00:06:49):
And so, as a consequence, the most important thing, if wanted to go to a lot of proms, I was a good dancer. And it turns out, the high-level bit, at least in the 1990s, for girls selecting who they might want to go to prom with was, will he and can he dance? And the answer with me was yes. And combine that with the fact that I knew a bunch of girls who went to different schools, that's the recipe for success right there, if that's the goal that somebody has. Two my junior year and 12 my senior year. I once went to three in one weekend, a Friday, a Saturday, and a Sunday night.

Lenny (00:07:21):
Another fun fact about you is you were basically the 10th engineer at Facebook, initially, way before it was a clear success story. I imagine there was a lot of pain and suffering and struggle that people don't often hear about those early days. They see a movie like The Social Network. It looks like, "Oh, that was so much fun. I've got to start a company. It's going to become a trillion-dollar success story." I'm curious just what those early days were like. Are there memories that stand out to you?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:07:47):
Yeah, there's a bit of a joke in the 10th thing, which is me and five other guys all joined at the same time, and there was nine engineers before us. We joined the same day, so we're all the 10th engineer. So, somewhere between 10 and 16, depending on how you want to do the numeration on that.

(00:07:59):
I've written about this in my blog, and I tell this story a lot, which is it was fun, and there was tremendous camaraderie and memories that were formed, but they were formed in a kind of forge of really intense times.

(00:08:13):
At that time, almost all of us lived within one mile of the office. We ate most of our meals together because we were working, not to say we weren't also friends, but because we were working, it's like, oh cool, you just roll into a meal and roll back into work.

(00:08:26):
And there's little things that you don't appreciate, which is like there was nobody to help you. There was no expert. And so, it wasn't like, "Hey, I'm struggling with this one tricky problem. Who should I talk to?" It's like, nobody. You should talk to yourself and figure this out. Or it's like, "Oh, man. My servers are out of capacity." It's like, "Cool. You should go to Fry's Electronics, you should buy a bunch of components, you should build a new server, and then you should run it. Maybe drive into the colo, rack it, and then get back and run it."

(00:08:52):
People really undervalue the fact that when you go to work, even a moderate mid-size corporation today, especially with the tremendous growth of startups supporting startups, things like payroll and finance and IT and HR, these things are professionally handled in many cases.

(00:09:10):
That was just not the case in the early 2000s. It was just you, and your personal car, and whatever you wanted to do with your time.

(00:09:18):
So, I don't want to take away from the romanticism of it, it's just that it's most often we hear those romantic stories from the successes. We so rarely hear somebody who went through really sacrificing a lot of my 20s from any kind of social or outgoing, fun environment.

(00:09:37):
It paid off for me, so no one feels bad for me, nor should they. But there are other people who do the exact same thing, maybe they worked harder, maybe they were smarter, maybe they did better, and it didn't play out for them. And it's a big sacrifice.

(00:09:48):
And so, I love the enthusiasm for startups, I love startup culture. I think it's a healthy thing for people to want to throw themselves into something and take that risk. But it is not glamorous at the time. In retrospect, it's like, "Oh, it can be..." We have a little halo around it. But at the time, it doesn't feel glamorous.

Lenny (00:10:06):
Yeah. In this post you mentioned, you said that you worked 120 hours per week.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:10:07):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:10:10):
You had no hobbies, and you gained a lot of weight.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:10:15):
Yeah. We drank a lot to make up for it, so I gained a lot of... And you weren't eating healthy. It was crazy.

(00:10:22):
I think I've told this before. There was a time where one of the first things I built was an anti-spam, kind of anti-scraping defense mechanism. But we didn't have any ops support. There was no 24/7 online support.

(00:10:35):
So, I built this tool. I had to wake up every four hours. For about two years, I didn't sleep for more than four hours at a time. I had to wake up every four hours and check the report, and to see if anyone was attacking the site. And if they were, I was up, and I had to go battle back. And if they weren't, cool, I'd go back to sleep. But that's the thing, they don't tell you about that stuff in the movies.

Lenny (00:10:55):
That's almost worse than having a kid, a newborn.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:10:59):
And nobody asked me to do it. Nobody even asked me to do the anti-spam, anti-scraping stuff. I just thought it was a problem, and I went and did that, and that was the solution I come with. If I was a better engineer, maybe I'd have solved a better problem.

Lenny (00:11:11):
So, maybe just to close out that thread, when you talk to founders, what advice do you give them along these lines?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:11:18):
I want to be cautious about this, because what I tell founders... The first thing I tell founders is that I've never been a founder, and I want to recognize the difference. I joined January 9th, 2006. That's almost two years after Mark started the company. I wasn't involved with fundraising, I didn't have to do any of that side of the things, and I didn't even have to deal with the board or the business side of things. I really was lucky, in a way, to have joined when I did.

(00:11:42):
But the first thing I tell founders is like, "You should take my advice with a grain of salt. I have not actually been in your shoes."

(00:11:47):
If I can compliment you, really, one of the things I like about your program is, there's a whole system of professionals in our industry. And when I grew up in technology in the valley, you always heard about the ACM, right? The Association of Computing Machinery. You heard of these legendary professional organizations that supported people in our fields.

(00:12:09):
And by the nature of the rapid pace of change in the technology, and the nature of the engagement of those institutions, even academics, even academia broadly, kind of are out of touch. The tools that you got from those places weren't useful in our field.

(00:12:23):
So, I do think the mentorship that we give each other has been a critical and sustaining resource. There is, today, now, resources like your podcasts and your newsletter that are actually really designed to help people who are professionals in our industry in a way that is almost kind of missing for 15, 20 years, and I love to see that. Because if you're an up-and-coming [inaudible 00:12:45], literally you used to have to know somebody and ask them a question.

(00:12:48):
And so, a lot of times what I'm helping founders with, I can help them with the strategy, I can help them think through the technology choices, I can help through business, I can think through the management, the organization structure. But I also try to be very clear, there's a bunch of stuff that I just was never exposed to.

(00:13:00):
So, even as we just talk about how tough it was for the average engineer joining Facebook in 2006, man, it was even tougher for Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, probably. And that's a story that's been told, I'm sure, but still. So, I think these are both... It's almost all scale and variant. No matter how far you dial back, the challenges are interesting and are worth talking about.

Lenny (00:13:22):
One of maybe your most popular posts is this quote that you share about the advice you often give. What you say is, "The advice I find I have to give more frequently than any other in my career, as a manager, a board member, an advisor and a friend, is for people to more directly leverage their leaders." Can you talk about that and what that means, and what that looks like?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:13:40):
It's such a normal and natural healthy thing. And by the way, we do it in our personal relationships. Like I said in the post, we want to do it ourselves. We want to do it ourselves to prove to everyone that we can do it ourselves.

(00:13:52):
And we think in our heads, "If I ask for help, haven't I already given up that goal? Haven't I just admitted defeat on one of my top level goals, which is to demonstrate that I can do it myself?"

(00:14:04):
But what so often we forget is, more often than not, your job is not to do it yourself. Your job is to get it done, is to have the thing done, done well, done right, done competently. And a lot of times, the tools that you need to do that live with your manager, with your partner, with your advisor, with your mentor. That's where they live.

(00:14:25):
So, how many times as a manager have I gone through, and somebody's told them, "Here's the job." They're like, "I got it." They go off, they come back, it's done, it's wrong. And I'm not blaming them for it being wrong. They didn't check in with me. They misunderstood. We miscommunicated. I'll take the L on that. That's no problem.

(00:14:42):
But here we are, six months later, it's not done right because they misunderstood the brief. We miscommunicated with the brief.

(00:14:49):
Or they come back, and it took a year. And I'm like, "Why did this take a year instead of six months?" And they're like, "Oh, man. I had all these things I had to deal with." Where, if they had emailed me, I could have bulldozed that stuff. I could have cleared the path. I could have said, " Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about that. This is the thing." And then we'd have been done six months sooner, and they would've been less frustrated. And so, light touches.

(00:15:09):
Now, I do think as a manager we also have a job to say, "Hey, that's kind of the work, so you got to kind of go figure that out." And one of my things I always tell my managers, one of the most powerful things we do is refuse to rule. Someone will bring me a thing. A lot of times we feel obligated to weigh in and help. I'll be like, "Nope, but look, I think you've got it. I think the challenges you're facing are the right challenges. I think you're approaching it in the right way. Just do your best there." And that's what it is. And so, there is a responsibility as well for those of us who are leaders, mentors, advisors, board members to do that.

(00:15:39):
But, by the way, we do this... Personal relationships. You're with your partner, and you're trying to do something the right way, but you're not talking to them about it. You're just taking a huge risk there, and for very little reward. They're not going to be mad if you ask them, like, "Hey, is this how you wanted it done? I don't know."

(00:15:56):
And so, I do think it's kind of funny how much we build these castles in our mind, these little silos that keep us from engaging the structures that are built around us, that are designed to help us succeed. I saw this great quote, actually just yesterday. I saw Patrick Stewart, who is one of my favorite actors of all time, and whose characters I love, and he talked about people going on casting calls. And this is a brutal thing for actors, right? You're going on 30, 40 things, you're getting rejected. It's tough. Everyone's kind of heard about this. And he said, "No one wants you to succeed more than the person you are auditioning for, because they want you to be awesome. Because as soon as you are awesome, they're done. They want you to be amazing."

(00:16:37):
That's like your manager. Nobody wants you to be more awesome than your manager does, because when you're amazing, your manager, his life gets easier, her life gets easier. So, I just think that's the mentality we get into is like, "No, no, no. They're testing me." They're not. They are rooting for you. I promise you that.

Lenny (00:16:53):
I love that advice. I imagine the reason people don't do this, as you said, is they don't want their managers to think they don't know what they're doing, or they can't solve it. Do you have any advice and guidance for when it makes sense to go reach out and ask?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:17:06):
One of the things I think, for people who are timid about this especially, is I think you can put a framing around it that's really easy for your manager to engage with. You can say, "Hey, I'm making progress on this. This is what I'm blocked on, this is the current program." And I'll even say, "Hey, if this all looks good to you, no response required. If there is something here that you want me to do better, different, that you think you could help with, let me know."

(00:17:32):
I love a typed, five-, 10-sentence email, "No response required. Here's where things are." Even if everything is going really well, I'm like, cool, this person understands the urgency, they understand the assignment, and they're giving me a little heartbeat, a little ping back.

(00:17:53):
And then also, if two weeks later, let's say the blocking issue is bad, then you say, "Hey, I am sorry, but I do actually need your help now. I'm actually blocked on this thing." I have the context. I have a mental model of you toiling away on the right thing, on the thing I asked you to do over there. Even then, when you're blocked, you can make my life super easy. Like, "Hey, what I'd love for you to do, if you could send an email to this person, here's a draft with this thought, that would help."

(00:18:23):
Or it's like, here are specific questions framed up. "I think this is what you want. Is this right? Yes or no? If no, okay, we'll come back and we'll spend more time. If yes, we're all good." So now, not only am I up to speed, I have a mental model, I'm engaged. Also, you've made it super cheap for me to help you. And people are always surprised. People who work for me are always surprised when I tell them how big a part of my job is doing these little types of things.

(00:18:53):
It's a little spinning plates at my scale. I've got 10,000 or 15,000 employees, depending on how you want to count different things. And so, you're just like, every now and then I got to get a whole new plate, a whole new rod, and just really put the effort into it. But for the most part, I'm just trying to touch everything and keep the momentum going. And so, if something falls, and somebody didn't tell me that "Hey, we're losing rotational velocity here. We're losing momentum." Oh, I'm bummed. I'm like, "Ah, now that plate fell. I got to start a whole new thing over here now."

(00:19:22):
So, I think people underestimate. They think of my job differently than my job actually... My job is actually tons of little touches.

Lenny (00:19:29):
So, I think a key takeaway here is, one, index more towards asking your manager and leaders for help. And I love this way of framing it of, it doesn't always need to be like, "Here's what I need from you." It's, "Here's what's happening. Here's things that might be blocking me. Here's questions I have. Here's things that are going on."

(00:19:44):
This is actually similar to something I found really powerful that I'll share real quickly, this idea of a state of... I call it the State of Lenny email. And I sent this email to my manager every week. The State of Lenny. It's kind of like State of the Union. And it's, "Here's my current priorities, here's what's on my mind broadly, and then here's blockers that I need your help with.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:20:02):
We actually used to have a format for that we called HPMs. Highlight, people, me. And every manager at Facebook from like 2008 to like 2014 would send to their manager, or even their leadership group. I mean, at one point when I was running what we called comm apps, I just sent it to Zuck and the whole leadership group.

(00:20:24):
It's like, what's the highlights include? And it highlights [inaudible 00:20:27] flow. What's the big ticket things you need to know? Where are people? Like is somebody in trouble? Is somebody at risk? Is somebody doing really amazing work that needs a shout-out? And then me, how are you personally doing? HPMs, we called them.

(00:20:39):
Actually, it's funny. I hadn't thought about that in a long time. But yeah, no, I think this kind of thing can work. And look, every manager is different, so even at the Meta level, by the way, is another success. I think what people do is they want to treat every manager the same, and that's not going to work because every manager is different.

(00:20:54):
But every manager, you can ask, "How do you like to get updates?" You can ask them when you first start working with them. Like, "Hey, what's your cadence? How do you like to stay informed?" And so, for me, I do regular one-on-ones. As the org's has gotten bigger, those have gotten more distant, so people have replaced those with more written things.

(00:21:11):
But no manager will get pissed at you if you're like, "How do you like to get information about me?" That's a totally reasonable thing to ask.

Lenny (00:21:18):
I love the specific idea you shared of just drafting the email to say the other team leader, "Here's what I need you to tell them. That would really unblock this thing." And that's such a cool idea.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:21:27):
By the way, I always put my own... I don't take that copy paste it. I'm always looking at that and be like, "Okay, I understand." A lot of it is actually not about what you want the other person to hear, it's about the voice, the tone.

(00:21:41):
It includes a lot of history. I don't know. Have you been going back and forth with them for 12 rounds, and this is going to feel to them like I'm really coming over the top? Or is this like, "Hey, first time you're hearing about this, my bad. Here's what we're doing. Need your help."

(00:21:54):
So, a lot of that isn't even about making my life easy because I want to copy paste. A lot of it is, actually, there's a rich set of information in how you tone and how you draft that note that's going to help me land it correctly and not feel like I'm just out of band, heavy coming in.

Lenny (00:22:11):
This touches on something that I often hear is very core to the way Meta works, which is transparency. Anyone can ask Zuck questions at the Q&A's. People are encouraged to post constantly internally of what they're thinking, what they're working on. All the data is shared publicly. Which often leads to leaks, which I hear you hate, and that is a pet peeve of yours.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:22:32):
Just feels like a violation of the team trust. Just feels like... I grew up with playing sports, right? I was football, soccer, track. And you just can't imagine one of your guys calling out the play to the other team. Can you imagine what you would do in that case? "You're off the team. I'm sorry, you can't be here." Anyways, sorry. Carry on.

Lenny (00:22:48):
Yeah, and there's so many more people, it's hard to find. Who is this? So, with this downside as an example, and I imagine there's other downsides also takes a lot of work, and it puts people on the spot a lot of times, what have you seen as benefits and why is that such a big part of Meta's way of working?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:23:05):
Yeah. This kind of comes back to, I think, the principle that really good, talented people, you want to leverage them fully. You really want to make sure that they are fully leveraged. And so, anytime they have the wrong information, or they don't have the information, you've now blocked one of the economically most valuable things that your company possesses, which is this person's time, attention, talent. Not only that, you've also made them more frustrated, and now they are more likely to leave.

(00:23:35):
If the lifeblood of any company are the people inside of it who collectively commit to some kind of a goal and a mission and work together, then you want to maximize that potential. And creating this really open information ecosystem is one of the ways that we do that. So often, great, phenomenal work that has happened at our company has not come from this one top-down mandate, but has come from people understanding not just what we're trying to accomplish top down, but also having way more information at their disposal to be able to act on it.

(00:24:16):
People talk about top-down or bottoms-up culture, and it's a bit of a myth, in my opinion. If you've ever met Mark Zuckerberg, it's not a bottoms-up thing. The ideas that we're pursuing are Mark Zuckerberg's ideas, first and foremost. That's not to say that he's not open to new ones, and of course he is, and that's a form of bottom-up, people can bring ideas to him and he internalizes them and acts them or not. But when he brings things top-down, he's not micromanaging, he's in the details. I'll be careful on that.

(00:24:44):
But he does create the space for you to bring back three or four versions of the thing that he's talking about, and then he shapes it from there. And you can't do that if there's... If you don't have degrees of freedom, sure, but also if you don't have the information. Otherwise, if you don't have the information available, what we're trying to accomplish, why we're trying to do it, what the infrastructure is like, what the availability is like, what the performance is going to be like, well, you just are stuck. You're just going to have to follow the script. That's very boring for high-talent, high-creativity, high-engaged people.

(00:25:15):
Now, it does come at a tremendous price. You have to get really good at managing information on the incoming. Most people at most companies consume all the information that's given to them, but the information itself is carefully managed. They're getting all the information they're intended to get.

(00:25:32):
We've turned that on its head, and it sounds great, but it's not free. Even somebody senior coming from outside of the company to the company, one of the things I have to coach them on is, how do you find signal amongst all the noise?

(00:25:45):
You have to have a system for managing your information. You have to have a system for triaging the incoming, getting rid of a bunch of stuff that is on the wrong channel, or it doesn't matter to you, figuring out what's the... groups that you want to be a part of, but you consume only when you choose to and-

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:26:00):
... groups that you want to be a part of but you consume only when you choose to. And where are the things where you're getting push notice? Like that's the real time thing, and that takes some time.

Lenny (00:26:08):
This point you made about bottom up versus top down is really interesting, because, when I think of Meta, I think it's a very bottom up culture. I hear everyone comes up with their ideas, runs experiments, is very encouraged to just try stuff, and it's really interesting to hear that. And it makes a lot of sense that most of the big ideas actually do come from the top.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:26:26):
It's of these mythology things. I don't think it's the wrong... As a contract, it's more bottoms up than many other companies, because you do have these degrees of freedom within the construct. But make no mistake, like Mark or me or Chris Cox or Javi, they have very strong opinions about what we should be doing as a company, and your bottoms up-ness works within that framework. But it is true that you can ask Mark any question, and he's going to answer it. Same with me, same with Chris, same with Javi and also that we certainly take inspiration from the discussion that we have with employees. So I don't know, it's just not as black and white as people tend to paint it.

Lenny (00:27:02):
I think one of the biggest lessons here is making it at least feel like you have a lot of say, even though a company is very, "Here's the big strategic [inaudible 00:27:10]," you're very good at making people feel like they can have an impact and a say.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:27:14):
And can I tell you, the most important thing is just giving people clear guidelines so they know where they... Like, "Where do they have space and where do they have no space?" One of the things that we go in these reviews with Mark or my team with me I'm sure, and I'm like, "For this part of the UI, it is going to... Like, I will draw it for you. It's going to be like this." And this other part. I'm like, "Cool, that's important, too. I don't have a clear vision of it. Why don't you do it?" So there's just really clear guardrails of like, "Okay, where are we just on assignment? And where do we have more flexibility?"

Lenny (00:27:45):
Is there an example of that that comes to mind where you were just very in the details and drawing the screen?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:27:51):
Over the course of time, there's been quite a few examples. I think early on, when we were working on News Feed, mark was absolutely whiteboarding every single pixel that the team had to put on the front end. On the back end, he was like, "Make it rank, have some ranking." So I felt like I was lucky there. I was just like, "Cool, I'm off to the races on some ranking stuff." And Chris Cox and all these other guys are having to really pixel-match these things. But it's not always that way by the way. So now fast-forward and we're talking about ranking, it's not like Mark is always hands-off on that. When we got into modernizing our ranking systems, which we've done over the last five years, Mark was heavily involved and like, " Hey, what's the mix shift and how are you weighing different things?"

(00:28:33):
And so it can go both ways. For me personally, I've gotten really involved in some relatively esoteric things. I was really adamant, for example, that hand tracking and mixed reality make it into the headset. Let's just say that there weren't any supporters in the team. Obviously we had a hand tracking team, which is phenomenal, mixed reality team, but there was a lot of people who were like... They did not feel those features were going to be critical for this to become a mainstream device. I always believed that they were for ease of use and for... So I just really forced the issue and didn't give anyone any room and held really high standards for the performance benchmarks we were going to hit on the hand tracking. And teams told me it was impossible. And it wasn't. It did great.

Lenny (00:29:11):
This touches on something that comes up a lot on this podcast. And there's this debate between how in-the-weeds founders and execs should be, whether they delegate, empower, versus, "No, we're just going to do it this way. I'm going to be very involved in every mock." And there's always this up and down that happens where it's like, "Okay, cool, we're going to let people run and do their thing," and then things start to not work as well often. And then, "We're going to take back control." You have just a perspective on when it makes sense to go deep, how founders execs should think about that?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:29:41):
Such a useless answer for founders, it depends on the weeds. There are some weeds that really matter and there's some weeds that really just don't, and I should say, that doesn't mean they don't matter at all. You have to do them, but they aren't the hinge upon which success or failure will happen. Yeah, there's people I really respect, Brian Chesky's been on and said, "Look, the Airbnb is going to work only on the things that I can work on. It's that's the extent of what it's going to do." And that's a super extreme form of it. I have a lot of respect for him and how they're working things. I think that if you have great super talented people that you can trust who can own bigger pieces, that's one option. If there are ways to structure it so that you can check in effectively and make sure that it's on track, that's another way to structure it.

(00:30:27):
And there probably is still work happening at Airbnb, that has to happen, finance and accounting and HR, that Brian isn't personally managing. So there are clearly non-technical areas that we do. Or legal. There are areas that we do trust that this is happening at. And so I think a lot of founders regret delegating too much, from my conversations. And I totally get that. Or they delegated something critical that really turned out to be the most important thing. For me, the judgment is like, "How do you, most important, determine what is what matters the most?" And so Mark, we joke inside of Meta, to this day, we call it the eye of Sauron. When Mark has determined that the thing that you're working on is the most important thing, there is no detail too small for him to notice.

(00:31:17):
He will be in a review, and in the same review. We'll be like, "Strategically, I think we're off course. And also, this one pixel is definitely wrong. You have to fix that." That's a big range. Frankly, I'll be a little bit self-congratulatory, I pride myself on being able to do the same. And I think people who work with me often comment that the style of leadership that we have, and I think Chris Cox is the same, is where it's like we will go where hide a low on the things that matter a ton. And there's a bunch of other things that certainly matter. We're glad we're doing them, but either they have pretty clear roadmaps, pretty clear examples in the industry, or it's like that's a feature that you have to have but isn't going to determine success or failure. So getting it into rough shape and then iterating on it is fine. And so I think it really does depend on the weeds, how deep you want to get.

Lenny (00:32:08):
It's so funny, I use exactly that same metaphor, the eye of Sauron, when I talk about working on things that Airbnb that matter a lot to Brian. And my advice to people is, "You don't want to be in that eye of Sauron for too long in your career, because you're just going to burn out if you're working on the most important thing all the time, but want to be close. You don't want to be in the Shire, but you want to be around the [inaudible 00:32:26].

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:32:26):
That's right. They're both... So I worked for years in ads. From 2012 to 2017, I ran ads in a business platform, this big ads group, and it was an area where certainly it was very important, but Mark had so many other things going on with the transition to mobile, he did kind of delegate it to me. And it was awesome, and it was so cool to have that kind of trust from him. And also, you're constantly terrified, because like, "Mark does not know. What if this is all..." My leads would be worried, because they just hadn't had a review with Mark in a while. And it's like, yeah, you suffer in the intensity of the gaze of Sauron. You also suffer in the shadow of its absence. There's no perfect place to be.

Lenny (00:33:09):
That's hilarious. I'm trying to think of the part of Middle Earth that is a metaphor for that.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:33:14):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:33:15):
Okay, so you talked about the News Feed, which was one of your very earliest projects at Facebook. Here's a couple fun facts I know about the News Feed. One is that it was the very first algorithmic News Feed of its kind of any social network and maybe of any sort of product like this. And two, it was the very first AI code that was written at Facebook to rank the actual News Feed. So there were a lot of firsts, and clearly this became a huge deal. The News Feed is essentially what people think of when they think of Facebook now, but it was super controversial when it came out. People were very against this. They did not want to be sharing this much information with people, or so they thought, and then they realized eventually, "Oh, this is actually exactly what I want." What did you learn from going through that experience of building something that people initially reject and then later realize that they actually do want this and this is exactly what they're waiting for?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:34:08):
This is a story that you tell a lot actually through your interviews, which is just like, "You have to have conviction in what you're building." You're choosing your customers as much as your customers are choosing you, is one way I think about it sometimes, and one mistake that you do see sometimes startups make is they get an early cohort of users whose needs actually take them kind of orthogonal to a larger market. And so they become kind of held hostage by their earliest customers now. So time and time again, we've had a vision for what we thought this should look like, and it wasn't the thing we were delivering right now. And so people who were using the thing we currently had were not sure that that change was what they wanted. But we had a confidence that over time they would, and we're not always right, but in these cases we were right. Now News Feed was an easier case than people suspect, because everyone was outraged at the same time as they immediately doubled their usage of the product.

(00:35:05):
So we had a few advantages there, which was, it was literally like everyone was like, "I hate this so much." And they would refresh, refresh, refresh. And so we were like, Okay, wait, there's cognitive dissonance here between what the stated preferences and what the revealed preferences are in the economic sense. So News Feed was a little easier than people suspect, to us, to stick with. But people sometimes misunderstand that. They think, "Oh, the lesson is don't listen to your customers. Not at all." And we certainly care a tremendous amount. And even with News Feed, we did actually screw some things up. I kind of always make this joke that it's almost like... You know when you're at the party and music's loud, you're talking to somebody and the music cuts out right when you're saying something at a super high volume, and so everyone in the party hears the last thing you said?

(00:35:42):
Now you were saying it in a public place, so it wasn't like it was a private comment, but you also didn't mean to broadcast it at that volume. We kind of did that to the entire user base. We took what had been wall posts, which sure, anybody could have gone to that profile and seen and then put it kind of on blast, on Main, as the kids say these days, "Put it on Main," and someone's like, "Ah." So we did that. I don't want to say it like... We did screw things up. It wasn't like, "Oh, this is a clause execution." So another thing to know is like, "When did you screw something small up, and when did you do something big up?" When is the thing itself wrong, versus when were the details wrong? That is an art. That is a real art, and you don't always have user data to determine it like we did.

(00:36:25):
And so a lot of that is, "Do you have a clear vision and intuition for what you expected to happen?" And then what happened instead and can you diagnose the delta there? So in the News Feed case, we made a bunch of little mistakes. The thing itself was right, and I really am quite proud of the work we did there. Me and Chris Cox at the most core probably in the engineering side, which you saw as the PM, there was no ranked feeds before that. We did have some AI that I built before for the anti-spam, anti... things, but it was pretty rudimentary, but it was probably the first consumer AI that was in a website of that kind around content. And we built the most efficient monetizing surface in history outside of Search, I think. [inaudible 00:37:04] for those who are curious, I don't use monetization because I think money's the most important thing. I do think it suggests the economic power you've created, which I do think correlates very strongly with human utility. Although obviously I respect that some people may disagree.

Lenny (00:37:17):
In terms of the economic utility, the Venn diagram of Boz, of News Feed and ads, create $1 trillion dollars of value.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:24):
It's not-

Lenny (00:37:24):
Well done.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:25):
It's not nothing, not nothing.

Lenny (00:37:27):
[inaudible 00:37:27].

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:27):
We're proud of that work.

Lenny (00:37:28):
You have this quote in one of your posts about the News Feed where you said, "It consumed me more fully than anything in life had ever consumed me. It opened up to me the truth that when you're passionate about something, you do better work, you do smarter work and you're, in order of magnitude, more productive."

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:43):
There's no substitute for it. One thing I've learned about myself since that post actually is just the degree to which I am somebody who is inclined to be passionate about things. And it's a gift that I'm lucky to have, and I understand that's not every person. And so actually the ads thing is a good example. When Mark told me to go work on ads, I was like, " No, I don't want to. I don't think I have a passion for that." I had this idea of myself. I had a very strong identity of myself as this AI infrastructure product guy, and I was working in this space and nope, I was wrong. I just am a guy who gets excited about things. Once I get into ads, it's like, "Oh, this is fascinating. It's a three-sided marketplace, and there's all these different..." It felt like I was playing chess times in terms of the moves with the other players in the industry, and I was super pumped about that.

(00:38:26):
And then when he wanted me to work on hardware, I was like, "No, I'm not. I'm a software guy. I'm a software guy, Mark." And now, I love this work. That's such a fascinating space that I've learned so much. So I do think that's right. I do think what I find something I'm passionate about that's good. What I have learned since then is to give myself a space to understand if I can get passionate about it. Now, there are parts of jobs that I've had before where I just never found the passion, and after six months I just have to move on. Literally it's like I'll either quit, get fired, I'm doing bad work, I don't care about the work. And so I do have a self-awareness. It's not that I can get passionate about anything, but I do have a pretty broad palette, it turns out.

Lenny (00:39:01):
I think that's a really interesting career lesson of, "Don't assume you won't be excited about something that may come up." Is there anything there that you'd share with folks of just like, "Explore it, give it six months, see if you can get excited about it?"

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:39:14):
Absolutely. So I have a very unusual career arc in some ways, which is I really almost changed jobs every six months for a long time. I was working on this integrity stuff with News Feed in the background. Then I was working on News Feed for about a year. Then I worked on site speed and infrastructure and detecting SAVs and issues. And then I worked on Bootcamp, and then I worked on messaging and groups. I had this really funny thing. I was kind of joking it was like, for those who are old enough to remember Karate Kid, I felt like I was painting a lot of fences, waxing a lot of cars, and at the end I knew karate. I was like at the end, at the end I had the payoff, because I'd gone through and I'd met a lot of people and I'd worked in these different areas and I understood different dynamics. Well, other people who joined in my cohort were getting promoted, but they were in a single track. They just stayed in one place and they got promoted, whereas I kept moving around. And it probably at some point early in my career felt like I was moving more slowly relative to my peers. And then when I finally turned the corner, really with the ads appointment, which I did for five years, I went vertical. I just like my career went vertical. And since then I've kind of been on that trajectory. And so advice I most often give people, for me at least, the lesson that I take from this, is I just was willing to learn aggressively. I would move because I wasn't learning enough. I was bored, and so I wasn't learning enough new stuff. And what was cool about finally getting to the ads job, and likewise in the job I'm in now, is those jobs, I learned a ton for five years. I'd never stopped learning in those jobs. You will occasionally find those jobs where they're super deep and you can just keep learning.

(00:40:50):
Meanwhile, a lot of my friends whose careers were on a better trajectory [inaudible 00:40:55] then earlier, they literally got bored of what they were doing, but they didn't have any place to jump to. There wasn't some other... They'd become domain specialists in a domain that they'd kind of exhausted for themselves. And maybe they'd even stuck around longer than they wanted to because it was comfortable or because the company wanted them to. And it ended up kind of being a hindrance to them in the middle of their career. And so for me, it's like, "Jump into new things, give it six months. If it's not the thing, no problem. You just built a ton of new skills that's going to come in handy, I promise you that. Keep going." And likewise, when you do make that jump early career, optimize for learning, optimize for... Think about a compound interest. It's like the first 10 years of compound interest don't look that impressive. It's like after 10 years it starts to look good.

Lenny (00:41:43):
I love that advice. It's similar advice I always give of, "Variety of experience often ends up being the most valuable thing you build over time," just trying to bunch of stuff, doing some internal tools, maybe working on customer support, I don't know, trust and safety, user-facing products, infrastructure. I'm thinking from a PM's perspective, maybe an engineers, and other functions. One question along those lines. So we talked about the eye of Sauron and working on the most important thing at the company. Do you have any advice on how much of your career you should be working in that center?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:42:12):
Yeah, listen, [inaudible 00:42:12] being equal, I think there's two really good places to be. I think one is carrying a lot of water in areas that the company's not paying attention to but you are important. And it needs to be a lot. You got to own that stuff and really move mountains over there, because I promise you, as an executive, when there's a huge dam holding up the floodwaters, you respect the heck out of the person who is holding that dam up. You're like, "You keep doing that, Atlas, that is good work over there." The second-best place to be, or maybe equally, is on the most important thing. And on the most important thing, that's where you get to the advice that Eric Schmidt gave Sheryl Sandberg, which is like, "Hey, it's a rocket ship. Get on. Don't ask what seat I'm in. Just get on."

(00:42:59):
If it's the most important thing, you're going to get a smaller piece. Everyone wants to be there. Get the piece. If it's the most important thing, get the piece that you can crush, kill, do a great job at and grow from, because you're going to get a ton of visibility, you're going to get a ton of experience. You're going to see what it looks like in the fire, in the fire, and that is invaluable. You will use that everywhere. And so I say that. That's at project selection time, but now I'll be cautious. Understand, projects that start in the fire, hopefully, are forged in some manner of metal that cools and is no longer in the fire, like God willing. And likewise, things like dams that are holding up floodwaters have a tendency to crack or break or floods overcome [inaudible 00:43:42]. So I think you do want to be at selection time in one of those two places, but then you also... You're going to stick with the ride.

(00:43:50):
And again, to my point, if you're not engaged, if you aren't doing great work, if you don't love it, then move on. If you've exhausted it, you used to love it, but you don't anymore, move on. If you still love it and you're engaged, great. That's cool. That's a great thing. You deserve to go from the forge to the dam and back over time. You don't have to always just keep jumping onto the latest fire. I tried to do that once, after the ad [inaudible 00:44:14]. Actually, so I spent six months and we built the first mobile ad product in 2012 and kind of saved the IPO, which had gotten pretty grim [inaudible 00:44:23]-

Lenny (00:44:23):
Yeah, I remember that.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:44:24):
... that point. And I told Mark, I was like, "This is so fun. Maybe you can just keep doing this, just putting me on the biggest fire every six months." And he turns to me, he said, "Buzz, that's not a real job."

(00:44:32):
He's like, "I need you to stay here and usher this forward," which I did for the next four and a half years. And it was amazing. It was amazing. And again, I do give him such... It's funny, I'm going to get a hard time in this. One of our biggest critics as well as being one of his biggest fans. I have both those jobs, but today we're talking about stuff that I think Mark really demonstrates really well. And he did a great job of pushing me in my career to different places where I didn't think I could succeed. And he saw the opportunity that made it happen.

Lenny (00:45:01):
What have you learned about that, giving Mark negative criticism, anything that he accepts? What do you learned about that?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:45:08):
Mark's voracious for all information and all points of view. One of the things that's pretty interesting, I talked earlier about how much, as a founder, I think especially, you have to have tremendous conviction. You just have to have a tremendous degree of confidence. And I think Mark is somebody who is maybe the strongest willpower of a person I've ever met, just in a pure willpower sense. One thing that's interesting about Mark is you'll give him feedback, he listens. He's a kind person to work for, so you'll give him feedback, and he'll listen. Truly. He'll most often tell you that you're wrong, why you're wrong. That's just like most often. And what will happen is... It's uncanny. It's like over the course of the next week or two, you'll just see shifts. And I don't think he's doing it...

(00:45:55):
I've always joked that the information gets to him. So much information every day gets him. And then at night, he re-compiles the whole world with all that information and comes back. And by the way, this is not just true about product work. In my head, I was thinking about product stuff where he was like, "Hey, I think this product is doing this wrong." He's like, "No, no, that's why it's not that way." And the product will start to shift. Also to give him feedback just on his own presence in a meeting or delivery, he'll be like, "Oh, well here's why I did it that way." And then a couple weeks later, you'll get in a similar situation, and he will moderate how he shows up. So I actually find him somebody who's really satisfying to give him feedback. It really works. It's very effective, but you do have to take the long view on it. And he will have a... The things he did, he didn't do an accident. He will have a reason why he did them the way he did them.

Lenny (00:46:39):
It's a great example of strong opinions, loosely held.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:46:42):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny (00:46:44):
It also makes me think, I think you used the compiler analogy. I'm thinking the model training. He's retrained his model overnight.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:46:50):
Yeah, that's right. It's funny. One of the things that's so funny about Mark is if you give him some feedback in the morning, the next six meetings he has, whether it's about that product or not, he'll ask people what they think of that feedback. He won't attribute. He's just like, "Hey, what do you think about this in this product? And so you'll be in a meeting with him and you'll see him doing it. He'll come to the meeting with you about some other topic. He'll be like, "Hey boss, what do you think about this product and this idea?" And so he will, over the course of the day, take that little note and kind of pressure test it, and he loves to triangulate. Where are all the points of view on this that maybe you didn't see? So he really values a broad perspective on each thing that's being discussed, which is really fun.

Lenny (00:47:29):
Trying to get more training data for his model. I get it.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:47:32):
You can't get me to call Mark an LLM. That's not fair. That's [inaudible 00:47:35].

Lenny (00:47:35):
We could all hope to be as smart as Mark. As you were talking, I noticed your tattoos, and it reminded me that you've got at least two tattoos that I'm aware of.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:47:35):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny (00:47:45):
One is of California, which I completely understand. California is a very special place, but you have this other tattoo that is just the words Veritas. Can you talk about what that's about and why that's important to you?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:47:58):
The funny thing about tattoos in general is I came out of high school, I was like... I don't know if there was an archetype for me, but I didn't drink until I was 21. I was a very rule-following person. I was like, "Why are you going to get a tattoo, affect your body? "Why would you dye your hair? Just let it be what it was." And some of this was I think I was somebody who was privileged and had a great deal of self-confidence in who I was and what I wanted to be, and that was fine. But in some ways I was also weirdly judgey about other people in a way that's kind of off- brain for me, certainly today it would be, but at the time, getting a tattoo is a big deal for me. I was like, "Oh, this is just the vehicle for my life and you can do whatever you want with it. And it's not like a... It's something that you possess, and if you feel like if you want to decorate it, you can decorate it.

(00:48:47):
And so getting a tattoo was a big deal to me actually, and I completely shifted my mindset of how I thought about my body and how I thought about people's body and their presence and their time, maybe to some degree, even an understanding of mortality. Like, "Hey, can't take it with you. It's all going to go..." When you're 18, you think you're going to live forever, and by the time you're 22, a grizzled 22-year-old veteran, you're like, "Ah, tattoo that bad boy up. It's all going down." And so yeah, that's why I got the Veritas tattoo, which is Latin for truth, which is... I will say it's a little cheesy, because it's also Harvard's motto. But I got it in a monotype font. This is the programmer's font here.

(00:49:28):
The other thing that's interesting to me about tattoos was it's also part of a generational shift. We grew up in a time when tattoos were really seen by adults as gangs or bikers or sailors or certain types. Now my understanding, I saw a stat recently that more people in my generation have tattoos than don't have tattoos. And so I think we also just culturally shifted positions in a way that... I find richness of self-expression wonderful. I really think it's great. And so I'm here for all of it.

Lenny (00:49:56):
My assumption from what you're describing is, this idea of truth is very important to the way you think and work.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:50:01):
My reputation does precede me on this point, I'm afraid, which is... I think when I was young, I saw being honest... And I was wrong by the way. I saw being honest as kind of a get out of jail free card. You could say whatever you wanted as long as you're being honest. That's just not the case at all. I've written about this before, but by far my biggest professional regrets were me not being kind. And I used to think... I wrote this note a while back called Be Kind, where being nice, that's like patronizing, or telling somebody things that are half-truths or just getting by. And I'm against that. But being kind isn't that. Being kind is like, "Hey, how can I deliver this feedback in a way that is actually productive and helpful, in a way that is going to help them and not cause them just to feel bad and helpless?

(00:50:50):
And I think I did that wrong a lot as a kid, as a young man. And so being honest is still a big part of my personality. No one would ever accuse me of being dishonest who knows me. And I think people understand and respect that I'm pretty direct, and if I have concerns or issues, I'm going to bring them up. I'm just much better at bringing them up now and expressing a true care and belief. I wouldn't bring it up if I didn't think we could do better, if I didn't think we could fix it, if I didn't believe in this situation. And so being honest is still a huge part of my identity, and I think that's something I'm very proud of. But I will say the contextualization of how I'm honest has changed immensely since I got this tattoo.

Lenny (00:51:29):
That seems reasonable. This touches a little bit on something I definitely wanted to talk about, which is one of your most classic pieces, and this is the way I first learned about you, is a piece that is called Communication is the Job.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:51:40):
Yep.

Lenny (00:51:41):
I know many people have read this, many people haven't. I'd love for you to just talk about what this means and why this is important, why this is something that you wanted to share.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:51:49):
Yeah, it's one of the things that, especially if you aspire to be a leader... And leadership isn't management, and leadership isn't being the only person responsible, it's not even always the same as accountability. But if you want to have an impact...

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:52:00):
It's not even always the same as accountability, but if you want to have an impact on the world around you, it is exclusively done through the creation of artifacts or verbalizations that affect other humans. That is all there is. That's all there is if you want to have an impact, if you want to create some kind of a lasting change. And it could be in your little relationship, it could be in your team, it could be in your company, it could be in the world. It is down to communication. And so often you hear people saying, "Oh yeah, I wrote that up a year ago." It's like, "Yeah, but you did a bad job of writing it up a year ago, or we would've not wasted a year not doing it."

(00:52:47):
People always think that's, "Oh, I had that idea," and that's means anything. It means nothing. It means absolutely nothing. Or it's like, "Oh, I wrote this post." Well, you didn't break through with it. That's on you. It's not on the audience. People want to blame the audience. Well, the audience is just there. I mentioned this even earlier, and I hope people caught it, when I said, "Hey," I give somebody a piece of work and they come back six months later and they have done the wrong thing, I'll take the L. I will take the L on it. It's not great for them. They'll be pissed they wasted their time, but like I said, that's my responsibility. I did not communicate clearly what I wanted, what the expectations were.

(00:53:25):
Could they have also helped themselves? Sure, they could have, and that's a thing that takes all sides. We should work on this problem for both angles. I have another post called Listening is the Job, which is the other side of this. But communication is the job is, I really believe... Actually, it's the relationship to this idea that came out of the US Marines and the SEALs of extreme ownership, which is... So whenever thing goes wrong, I ask myself, "What could I have done differently in terms of how I communicated things for this to have gone better?" Could I have set priorities better? Could I have set expectations better? Did I need to have a better metric that I pointed the team at? Did I put the wrong people on it?

(00:54:04):
By the way, the thing I talk about is org charts are communication devices. They don't exist. There's not a physical string between you and your manager. They're just communication tools that are supposed to give people a rough sense of how things are organized and where to go with who. And so all these things are communication. Silence is communication, me not reaching out to you to check on you, to check on your project. We talked about the [inaudible 00:54:29] earlier. What does that mean? That means trust. That means responsibility. The absence of check-ins has meaning. You cannot not communicate. You are always communicating something with your face, with your clothes, with your body. What are you communicating?

(00:54:45):
I'll give you a funny example, which I hope we get to put in the podcast, because if you're watching this on video, you will have noticed that my camera cannot stop adjusting light. It's just constantly too dark or too bright. I'm trying a new camera. I'm a nerdy guy. I try a lot of camera gear, I try a lot of microphone gear. I love to have all the latest gadgets and gizmos, so I'm trying something new. It's not working. And in my head I'm like, what is this communicating about me? People are going to think that I don't care or that I'm not competent.

(00:55:15):
That's what I'm talking about. And now, I felt compelled to explain it in the podcast so that I can communicate clearly that that's not the case. I really just think so much of what I try to do in my professional life is understand the mental model of other people. Where are they right now? And I mean specific people, like my managers or my key technical leaders, and I mean general people like teams, and I mean broadly just the average human. Where are they at in this conversation? And how can I craft my language, my presence, my persona, everything to usher them from where they are to where I want to get them?

(00:55:52):
And that requires me to have a very clear idea of where I want to get them, have to have a clear idea of where they are. And I want to tell you, it's not as much work as it sounds like. I think no one would accuse me of having this big fabricated persona. It's not that. But it is having tremendous empathy for where people are starting. That was the lead for me. All the rest of it, all the rest of how I show up in meetings trying to smile more, because I'm like a big scary guy, those things are little things that you work on and they become second nature and they're easy. The hard thing is just having the empathy for your audience and being, "Where are they? Where are they starting?" And when you miss taking responsibility for that, extreme responsibility for that.

Lenny (00:56:31):
There's so much good advice in that. There's so many threads I want to follow, but let's just follow this last one of trying to understand how someone is best communicated to. Is there an example to make that a little more real for people of just what you've done to, "Oh, here's how I'm going to communicate with this person?"

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:56:46):
I'll give you a couple. One is multimodality. There's an old saying, repetition never spoiled the prayer. And I think most experienced communicators, whether they be writers, whether they be public speakers, talk about the importance of reiterating a point several times and in several different ways to make sure that people have a chance to internalize it. You want to use it, you want to say it directly, you want to use metaphor. And so for me, I will give an all-hands and then write a post with the content of the all-hands, because different people are going to respond differently to these modalities and are going to absorb information at different rates on these different modalities. That's a trivial one.

(00:57:23):
Another one that I think of all the time is making sure that you address people's fears and concerns. People will not listen to you if they think you don't know what's going on. And so, one of my favorite things to do when we're talking about some kind of issue is right up top and say, "Hey, let me be clear. This is the issue we're having. I know we're having it. I know what matters." And then I'll say the same thing that I would've said, but they would've literally ignored me, because how can they trust my conclusions if they don't accept the premise? You know what I'm saying? I think there's a whole piece there. Obviously when you're in person, it's a lot easier because you're reading facial expressions. Even on this, I'm reading you nodding on that. I'm like, "Okay, he's with me." And then I throw in a, "You know what I mean?" Whereas if you give me a cocked head, I then bring a second example to try to drive the point home. But you build yourself up. Most people are going to realistically start in their careers trying to influence one or two people. That's where you start. One or two people. That's who you got to communicate with. Your manager, one teammate, that's who you got. And then you build up and build up and build up a skillset to do it at a larger and larger scale.

Lenny (00:58:36):
I love so much of this advice. I think it's also helpful for relationships. "Here's what you're upset about."

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:58:42):
Totally, a hundred percent.

Lenny (00:58:43):
"Here's what I think we can do."

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:58:46):
Again, the work that I've had so graciously supported to do on myself at Meta with great mentors, Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, a bunch of others and coaches absolutely made me a better partner and husband, and my wife. And then by the way, vice versa. Having kids and getting deep in the literature around raising children. Congratulations to you, by the way. Getting deep in that literature made me a better manager. Absolutely made me a better manager in terms of thinking about how people are managing their emotions and how to engage with them in those times.

Lenny (00:59:16):
Amazing. We need a second edition of this Boz's Parenting Advice.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:59:19):

(01:00:47):
Okay. You mentioned this gadget and these cameras you like to play with. Let's talk about the Vision Pro and VR headsets. Have you tried the Vision Pro? Thoughts?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:00:57):
Actually, Mark and I tried it together and I want to say, first of all, when the headset came out, we breathed a little sigh of relief because the stuff inside of it didn't represent a fundamental breakthrough. Everything inside of it was something that we probably could have gone and done, with the exception of Apple silicon, which is a marvel, but it's worth nothing. Apple Silicon is like a 2X marvel when doing things like scaling display resolution is unfortunately a quadratic proposition, and so a 2X linear scaling advantage doesn't buy you as much as you might expect when you're trying to scale resolution. And so that was step one. But we still assumed at that price point, with their legendary attention to detail and polish, they probably produced a great product. And the line that I said actually my own podcast with Matthew Ball a week ago was, "Look, I was prepared to come to market and say we have the best value headset. If you want an outstanding, best possible headset for the money, we've got it. It's the Quest 3."

(01:01:55):
And I was so thrilled when I tried the AVP next to Mark, we were like, "No, we think we have the actual best headset." Now, we're not saying it's the best at all things. If you're sitting still and watching a movie a high-res movie, Apple Vision Pro is really great. It's really great. The resolution shines. The way they've tuned the pass-through shines if you're stationary and looking straight ahead. And they've done some really nice things with the UI. It's one of these things that we do get annoyed about, a mile aside, we get a little bit annoyed about as product people.

(01:02:31):
I know that this happens to all of us. It happens to Apple, happens to Google, happens to us. We have a bunch of internal things we've been playing with, which will at some point ship and we will be accused of having stolen them when we actually did not steal them. If you want, you can go see my Quora answer on the history of the like button where this happened previously, where we had built the like button internally before it was launched elsewhere. Anyways, it's a whole thing. This happens in our industry a lot, and I really shouldn't care as much. It's a little bit of my ego peeking through, which I should control and tamp down, if I'm being responsible.

(01:03:03):
The beautiful UI polishes, they did a tremendous job with eye tracking. One of the things that's interesting about the eye tracking is, to do it the way they've done it, that's why you have to have the prescription insert, so it doesn't support your glasses. You have to get prescription inserts. They're expensive. And they can shoot the cameras that track your eyes through the lens as well as the light around it. Ours go from the side on the Quest Pro, and that allows you to wear corrective lenses.

(01:03:27):
And so different choices like that have trade-offs, but it's still cool. It's great that they got that in there. At the same time, our hand tracking is better. Obviously, the app library we knew was going to be better. That's not totally fair to them. They've just launched and they have small volume still, but I just find the comfort... The thing that really got me the most, the field of view is really small on the Apple Vision Pro. And some people are characterizing it incorrectly on the internet. They're doing a characterization up close to the lens. Once you factor in the eye relief, the distance between where the lenses are and your eyeball is, their field of view gets pretty narrow for almost all faces relative to ours, which I find distracting.

(01:03:59):
Their displays are much dimmer than ours, and I find the motion blur really distracting when I'm in mixed reality use cases. And as I mentioned earlier in the podcast, I'm a huge mixed reality buff. I'm a huge fan of that potential for exactly the same reason that they are, by the way, which I think hands and mixed reality make it feel much more accessible to more people. I'm pretty glad we have the controller in our set though, because it really expands what you can do. And we don't just operate our computers with just one thing. We have a keyboard, we have a mouse, we do multiple modalities all the time. I really feel like the comfort, the lack of persistence and motion blur in our pass-through, the brightness of our displays, I was like, "Oh man, if you gave me one to take, I would take Quest 3."

(01:04:40):
Now, people have rightly said, "That's pretty biased." Of course it is. Go get your own opinion. But what kills me is most people haven't done that. They have not tried the Quest 3. That's what kills me the most. If you go and try Quest 3, ask yourself if you'd rather have seven of those, one for you and six of your best friends, or one Apple Vision Pro. I'm sure the answer isn't Quest 3 for every person. There are people for whom there are use cases that really fit their life, the Apple Vision Pro, I'm cool with it.

(01:05:05):
But people don't even know that the Quest 3, you can do Remote Desktop. You can do it both through an app called Remote Desktop, which is very popular, or you can go into workrooms and you can have three monitors surrounding you streamed from your machine. I think some of this is just people have not even done the work. They haven't even tried it. I welcome all of you who think I'm biased to prove one way or the other what you think, but don't do it without putting the Quest 3 on and giving it through its paces, because it's a pretty great device. And you can do a lot with $3,000 extra dollars.

(01:05:38):
How did they get away with that, by the way? We launched a headset that was $1,299 and people lost their minds about it. They're like, "Ah, $3,500, it's fine. This is fine. No one cares." I don't know. Fairness is too much to ask, and I don't care about that. Apple has earned the great brand that they've built. They truly have. I think it's tremendous. I certainly celebrate a large number of Apple product. I'm a huge fan of their work. I'm a huge fan of what they do. That's probably why I expected more from the AVP.

Lenny (01:06:06):
Well, I'll show you my favorite AR device, which is these Ray-Bans. I actually bought them.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:13):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:06:13):
Here, I'll put them on it. Here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to record. I didn't tell you I was going to do this. I'm going to record this as we're talking. Look at this.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:20):
I like that. They look so good on you too. This is a good fit.

Lenny (01:06:23):
My mother-in-law's like, "You look so sophisticated. You look really smart with these on." And we bought these actually to film our kids, or our kid, instead of having Cameron's face. And it's been awesome.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:34):
It's really the best. It is so hard to look at a phone screen and have the real thing be in between you. No, the glass is the way to do it.

Lenny (01:06:43):
Look at this, my new look. I'm just going to have glasses on all the time.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:46):
We got to get you the multimodal. I've been playing with that since December, where you can use the camera to ask a Meta AI assistant about things. It's really good. I was in a ski village recently with my family and I had them on. I'm just like, "Hey, take a look. Tell what you see." And I had found a sign and it gave me directions. "Hey, the bathrooms are down those stairs to the right. Do you want food? It's over to the right." It couldn't tell what village I was in, but it was like, "You're in a ski village somewhere. Here's the amenities." And I was like, "Wow." There's something real magical here.

Lenny (01:07:18):
I feel like I need this for my podcasting interview so I could just have a little voice tell me questions to be asking and where I'm at.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:07:25):
Right, totally. Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:26):
How helpful would that be?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:07:27):
Okay, I'm going to cheat on this one and say, obviously we've been talking for a while, but playing with glasses that have full AR capabilities, and we've got one that has rumored to be coming internally soon, so heavily rumored in fact that you might even say it's almost been confirmed. And what's been really fun is being able to play with these time machines, really, in terms of what they are. It's amazing technology. People were giving us speeches, big company-wide speeches, and had all their notes on the glasses. And they could control the slides just using a gesture.

Lenny (01:08:05):
Oh my God.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:08:07):
There's exciting things afoot. The future's looking pretty bright.

Lenny (01:08:10):
Something that I wanted to touch on, which is when Mark put out this whole video of, "Here's what I think of Apple Vision Pro versus the Quest," a lot of people are just like, "Oh man, because he's putting out this video, he must be so afraid of what's happening and it's not the right move." What went into thinking? Was there strategic thinking there? Was it just him, "Here's what I think?"

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:08:29):
This guy does [inaudible 01:08:30] about the modern era. Everyone's in their Meta head about everything. Everything's a four-dimensional chess. That was just what Mark thought of the thing. That's what he thought about it. I think he wanted to make sure people remembered, hey, Quest 3 is literally a better device, and people haven't even tried it.

(01:08:46):
And so we're not always playing four-dimensional chess over here. Sometimes we're just like, "Here's a thing that I believe is true. I'm going to say it out loud with my mouth." That's what he did. It's not that hard. When I do it, everyone expects it because of my persona or brand or whatever the thing is. I guess people are surprised when a CEO does it. All right, I get that. That's cool. There's other sets of societal expectations there.

(01:09:08):
And we're all familiar with Apple putting the Welcome IBM ad in the New York Times, and then Slack doing the same thing with Microsoft and the Ballmer iPhone comments. None of those were true discussions of the technical merits of a product. Those were all just big, rally the troops gestures. This is not that. Mark is deep. He's an expert in this stuff. I'm an expert in this stuff. I feel great about our choices.

(01:09:39):
By the way, when I've used it, I could get myself completely into the head of the person who designed it. I can tell you from using it what instructions they were given, that team was given. I can tell you what they were optimizing for. I can tell you what constraints they were under. By all the choices they made, I can tell you all those things and I understand it coheres in that way. We made different choices. It shouldn't surprise anyone. We like our choices better. We could have made those choices. We didn't make those choices. We made these other choices.

(01:10:06):
And so for me, the weight, the wire, which just always brushes against my ear, the pocketable thing, I get it. That's not what I would've done, and I know that because I had the chance to do it and I chose not to. I don't know. I don't know why people are surprised. This wasn't some big, savvy strategic move. This was just, Mark's got a chance to use it. He's like, "Oh man, I think we should tell people what the real story is here." And we did.

Lenny (01:10:34):
I love that insight. And I know a lot of people watching are like, "Oh, shit, he's right. Wow. I didn't think of it that way." And so I think it had a lot of that impact.

(01:10:41):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about Meta's journey over the past couple years. It feels like there is a huge downturn in public perception of Meta and the stock price, and then over the past couple of years there's been a huge turnaround. And it feels like there's always a lot to learn from these periods. Just as an example of the stock price, I was just looking at it, it was down to $80-ish, and now today it's $487.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:11:05):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:11:06):
I'm curious just what you've learned from going through that downturn and turnaround. And I know it's still in progress, but just what have you learned from that journey?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:11:16):
Yeah. Well, there's a lot to take away, I got to tell you. I think we had the largest single day stock drop in history, followed 18 months later by this largest single day gain in stock market history.

Lenny (01:11:27):
Oh my God.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:11:27):
As the legendary Lou Holtz said, " You're never as good as they say you are when you're winning, and you're never as bad as they say you are when you're losing." Mark has always brought that quote out to guide us internally to try to insulate ourselves a little bit from the vagaries of external opinion. And that's not just true with stock prices. That's true with media and press. It's true across a lot of things.

(01:11:53):
One of the things I told my team, and I still have to repeat it to them, is, "One of the things that's hard to remember when you're in it is that you know more than the critics do. You know more than the analysts in the marketplace do. You know more than the media does. You know more than the podcasters do. You know more than the Twitter does. You know more about what's real and substantial of value about our company than they do. That doesn't mean ignore them, because they have a different perspective and you need to understand it. Even if the totality is less than what you know, it may contain parts that you do not know." I'm a huge fan, I read the criticism of everything, and I read it very carefully, looking out for confirmation bias, looking out for things that I might be inclined to resist but are maybe true. I invite all critique, but I also don't accept the critique blindly. I don't just say, "Yes, this is obviously true."

(01:12:55):
Gell-Mann Amnesia is a great concept for everyone to understand. Gell-Mann Amnesia is this property where you'll read a newspaper article, let's say newspaper, why not, about a thing about which you are an expert, and you'll be baffled because here is an article that is not just wrong, it's inverted causality. Michael Crichton, I'll steal Michael Crichton's quote on this, "It's a wet sidewalks make rain story." And you'll be like, "What a terrible, bizarre story."

(01:13:22):
And then you will turn the page of the newspaper and it will be another article about a topic about which you know nothing, and you will read it as if it is the gospel truth. You'll figure it's, "Oh, no, look at this information about this foreign situation." Like I said, perfectly true. We should be smarter than that. And so does that mean you don't read the thing? No, you read it. You just read everything with that perspective of, "Wait a second, this is another point of view. And how do I integrate that into a whole perspective that I can have and be informed about?"

(01:13:55):
The first, the macro thing is taking the long view, realizing that when you're in the dumps, it's not as bad as you think, when you're at the top, it's not as good as you think. It's somewhere in between at all times. The second thing is communication is the job. We really did not communicate effectively, I think, with the market around our future investments. And listen, we've had two 10-year long huge investment areas. One has been AI, one has been reality labs. And AI's looking pretty good today. I can't think we can all agree with Lama 2, with Fair, the breakthroughs that we've had.

(01:14:33):
People don't notice that Fair, our AI research lab, is the second most cited research lab in AI behind Google. We've been doing this work. We didn't come here casually. We've been doing it, and so that's looking pretty good. I don't think we did enough to explain those best to people. Previously, the core business was going strong enough and they were willing to ignore them. And with the old Warren Buffett quote, "It's only when the tide goes out, we see who's not wearing swimming trunks." And so when the tide went out, when you have the Ukraine war and an interest rate hike and recessions, now everyone's scrambling for that incremental dollar and they're like, "Go get rid of this stuff."

(01:15:15):
And we had to tell the company, "You don't want to work at a company that, when times are tough, kills all future growth and just shores up in the core business." That's a company that's just committing itself to dying at some point, a little later than expected, but dying at some point. You want to work at a company that has a balanced portfolio of investments, which we had. We didn't explain that well, and so we spent that time explaining that to the market, to the press, to everybody.

(01:15:38):
And now, I think as people understand the size of it and the scope of it, and of course it helps that the core business has overcome its challenges there from ATT and the other kinds of stuff, it's looking pretty good. I do think one part is, as an internal person, really moderating your attachment to the external narratives and swings, that's super important. And you do that based on understanding your own expertise. And the second part is understanding why is there a delta. What is there? And grab that. It's usually communication.

Lenny (01:16:10):
There's also a big flattening of the org. This was something a lot of people talked about, where managers became ICs. Is there anything more there that you've learned of just how to adjust the org to be more efficient?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:16:22):
Of course, and I should have included that in the first section. I was a bit eager to wrap it up elegantly in the two. But you're right.

Lenny (01:16:27):
I appreciate it.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:16:29):
We made significant shifts in how we operated the business, which was super painful. And listen, this goes back to the boom times of COVID, when it looked like there was a real lasting secular shift in things like e-commerce and in working remotely and these tool sits, which are exactly what we build, and it's primed us. And so we built up a huge workforce to pursue those opportunities. We still believe in those opportunities, but they're back on their original timeline. And actually, literally, if you look at a bunch of graphs that we have internally, it's literally the COVID boom and then, not bust really, but as it receded, everything's back on its original trajectory.

(01:17:16):
We didn't lose ground or lose time, but the pull forward didn't happen. Well, that means your economics don't make any sense anymore. Now, you made a bunch of investments that are going to yield too distant in the future, and getting there faster isn't going to help you and you're carrying a much extra cost. That sucks, man. It sucks. And we don't feel great about it. We really don't. It's a business, it's awful, and it happens.

(01:17:41):
I do think one thing that was interesting about that time was, for those of us who grew up and saw the .com boom firsthand, I was born and raised in the valley, so that was all around me when I was graduating high school and going to college, and then in the 2008 major recession on the housing crash and on the market and all that stuff. Now, let's imagine you graduated college in 2009-

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:18:00):
... all that stuff. Now let's imagine you graduated college in 2009 and got a job. Well shoot, you're 15 years in your career, you could be a director and you've never seen a downturn. I think we also had, in addition to what was very unfortunately conventional mis-forecasting in the business that caused us to over hire, that we had to correct for. You also had a workforce that was just not at all of a mentality that this could ever happen. This felt like it was an act of God when in fact it's like a cyclical nature of all businesses that this will happen at some time and you hope it doesn't and you wish it didn't, but you have to deal with it. And so I think we have a bit of a tough storm there for the whole industry and we're still feeling it. I think we're still feeling it.

(01:18:45):
Certainly we're happy at Meta to be beyond that point and we're growing again and executing at a stable rate and feeling really good about that, but quite a few of our other companies in the industry. And it's a very uncertain time for engineers, for PMs, for designers, for everyone and all the support functions around them. I'm super sympathetic for that. I think obviously the mis-forecasting that happened inside of Meta's walls happened everywhere and now that you have, especially with higher interest rates and cash isn't as cheap, runways are tighter. People are just making those pragmatic calls. I think we'll rally back from this. I think this is a normal thing that happens to industries, but it doesn't reduce my sympathy and empathy for those who have been affected by it or who live in fear of it.

Lenny (01:19:29):
I was talking to a friend who works at Meta and I was asking them what it's like to work at Meta and she was just like, "It's intense, and it used to be more chill. There were people that were coasting here and there," and now she's like, "No, all those people are gone now. It's just only the intense people left and we're working really hard." Does that bring up anything?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:19:48):
Yeah. I don't want to comment on people who left. People left Meta for all kinds of different reasons and likewise role elimination happened in many cases because we just decided not to do this work at this point. We were going to do it two years from now and don't need to carry a team to do it. I think it's really hard to generalize because each of these is a specific person with a specific life and a story that is rich and deserves to be told. But I do think that if there was somebody coasting and you as a manager have to make tough calls on who you're bringing in which way you're going to bias my profound suspicion, and again, I don't know your friend who you spoke with, my profound suspicion is that person's probably already working hard. You know what I'm saying? That person's already probably working hard. I don't think we changed how hard any individual worked. I really don't believe that.

(01:20:35):
I do think there was a selection bias as to what was going to happen, and I think that's probably what you saw play. In fact, if there is a generality that can be found.

Lenny (01:20:43):
Maybe as a last question, I have this segment where I call Failure Corner where I ask people to share a failure of their career and what they learned from that experience. Is there something that comes to mind?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:20:55):
I've failed tons of times. I've built products that nobody used. I've built technical architectures that didn't scale. I've failed all kinds of times. I don't regret most of those. Almost every one of those I learned from. It was a stop on the path to a better solution or it was a recognition that this thing wasn't going to work ever, which is its own kind of a gift. All the failures that I regret, that I take seriously are personal failures where I affected a person in a way that I'm not proud of, maybe wasn't proud of the time because I wasn't in control of my own emotions or mood. I was feeling fearful, I was feeling scared, and there's a bunch of these one or two that stand out that I don't feel comfortable sharing because the person affected, I think would prefer I didn't share.

(01:21:46):
I'll share one that was... I think the person's and I are tight now. We have this really silly discussion. I remember it so vividly. In the early days of client server architectures, which Facebook obviously is a website, so you're calling to a server to get the webpage, but then that server is going to call the other servers to gather things and that was one of the major clients of remote procedure calls because newsfeed ranking was all done on this other set of servers that had its own special requirements and special build and how it was put together. And so your main web server would put a call-out over a remote procedure, call to the remote server and get a response back. And we had this really janky RPC system that, I won't say who built it, but it was built and it was just a piece of garbage constantly failing. It was not robust at all. And one of our best engineers, Mark Sleek, built a new one called Thrift. It was a great, really great RPC infrastructure.

(01:22:47):
And one of my best friends, Dave Federman, one of my really good friends and a brilliant engineer, we were talking about how to do the encoding and I was like, "I want it to be binary encoding." I was like, "You should binary encoding. I want it to be super efficient on the wire," because I'm storing these RPCs. They do two jobs for us, one of which is the active RPC, but I also store the RPCs in a log and replay them to do the work that we were doing in newsfeed ranking. That's how it was done back in the day. It was all kind of asynchronous offline and so I wanted to be as tight as possible. My memory bandwidth was very limited and memory was so expensive back then and Dave Federman was like, "No, no, no, that's short-term thinking Boz, we should be using Linux style descriptors that are plain English language. Then you could look at the log, you can see what it is. It's possible memory bandwidth will get cheaper, but these logs being scrutable to development is going to be a better thing." This is nerd bait.

(01:23:42):
Those of you who have been engineers in this call, this is like Vim EMX. This is nerd bait. This goes deep. This is like a long old thing.

Lenny (01:23:51):
I love it. Keep it coming.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:23:52):
It's a room full of engineers at the company and the company's not that big, and so there's probably half the engineers of the company in this room. I was yelling. Literally I'm turning red, I'm sweating. I'm so angry at Dave Federman for countermanding my proposal and I'm the major RPC customer. A couple things. This is so dumb. Mark Sleek just built two encoders. It's not that hard. You pick which encoder you want for your things. That's the easiest solution ever. Second thing is Dave was right, by the way. Within a year, the memory bandwidth definitely didn't matter relative to how inscrutable it was to try to get into these logs. I had to build a ton of extra custom software to parse the logs and understand what what's going on. But also it was a case where my identity was caught up in being right. And for those who don't know, identity threat is just the biggest... Your worst behavior is always going to come out when you think you're under identity threat.

(01:24:51):
When you feel like some core part of how you see yourself is in question, you will react with every ounce of your fiber to defend that conception of yourself because it's so expensive to reconceptualize who you are that you defend yourself. So my identity was being right. [inaudible 01:25:08] on the wrist. And it caused me to take one of my best friends, one of the best engineers I knew, a guy I literally lived with and getting a really embarrassing for me conflict, which everyone was just scratching their head like, "What is going on with Boz right now?" I looked like an unhinged crazy person. I remember the room, I remember where I was standing in the room. I remember everything about that moment and I had to go home and be like, "What the fuck was that? What happened?" I'm asking myself like, "What happened there?" And that was one of the many steps in the journey to recontextualizing what it was was not to be right and what meant to be open-minded and curious and how to engage in this competition.

(01:25:47):
I was 22. I don't make excuses for it now, but I remember there was a couple other examples like that in things that were less technical and more personal that I won't share, but I remember each of them vividly and those are the real failures for me.

Lenny (01:26:01):
I love how this story is so long ago at this point and it's still stuck with you and such an impact, I think.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:26:06):
Oh, my god, I'll never forget that. It was embarrassing. And for those, that's the old quote, it's really one of the truest quotes, and I know it's cliche and sometimes cliches are cliches because they're good. It's like, "People, they don't remember what you said. They just remember how you made them feel." That's all anyone remembers is how you made them feel, and I think in that room, I made people feel unsafe, maybe. It was bad.

Lenny (01:26:27):
I like this concept of identity threat. They call this podcast episode identity threat.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:26:32):
There you go.

Lenny (01:26:33):
Boz, we started this episode with a billion questions. I have a billion and one questions now. I wish we could keep going, but I know we have to wrap this up. Is there anything you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:26:46):
Well, in the off chance that we do end up labeling this episode, identity threat, let me give you what really was... I made a lot of breakthroughs with coaching, learning about the feeling inside of my own body when I was feeling that identity threat and learning techniques and tactics to reduce the likelihood I would feel it and how to deal with it when it happened and how to repair when I did, I went through all that stuff. I would say the greatest lesson I learned would come years later and it was just from observing somebody. Ami Vora who was a legendary, long time came in and worked on our development platform, then worked with me on ads for a long time and then was the PM lead for WhatsApp for a long time. She's since gone on to do even more great things outside the company. Working with her, it was like watching an alien because her and I were so different in our approach and she approached...

(01:27:38):
She could have the most profound disagreement with somebody in the world and they would say the thing that she thought was not just wrong, but crazy wrong and she would respond. She would say, "Fascinating. You have to tell me more about why you think that." And I can't do it justice, she meant it from the core of her being. She saw this schism between her and that person and it could have been personal, it could have been professional, it could have been anything. She saw this schism and how they saw the world and how she saw the world and rather than reacting as if it was a threat that somebody saw it differently or rather than reacting afraid that maybe she was wrong and had done things wrong before, she reacted with the most genuine and profound curiosity. I just watched it absolutely tear down walls between points of view. People felt immediately her genuine heartfelt curiosity and would lean in and that would cause them to be open-minded.

(01:28:36):
And if she was right, which by the way she usually was, then they would leave being like, "Oh, okay, I was wrong about that," but she also would change her mind and that was the key. Ever since then, I really have tried to model that. When I have a strong internal clinch, I try to embrace curiosity like, "Wow, we do not see this thing the same way. That is fascinating. Tell me why you see that." And that can be by personal feedback. Someone's like, "Hey boss, I don't think you talk enough." "Wow, you don't think I talk enough? That is unexpected. I would love to hear more about that because no one's ever said that to me," so I wanted to give that to anybody who might recognize this behavior in themselves. There's lots of things that you can do and you should do that work.

(01:29:22):
The work of improving yourself is always fruitful and satisfying and it pays off, as we discussed, in every aspect of your life with your family, with your friends, and professionally. This is one that I really thought was so great was just curiosity. Embracing curiosity in those moments of challenge has really completely changed my life and I owe that to Ami Vora.

Lenny (01:29:40):
Wow, I love this example. It's basically an example of, "Yes, and?", but in a really... no one's going to be like, "Yes, and?" It's a really nice way of saying it, "Just fascinating. Tell me more."

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:29:50):
Fascinating. You've got to tell me why, I want to understand it.

Lenny (01:29:54):
I love that. Maybe that'll be the new title, fascinating.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:29:56):
There you go.

Lenny (01:29:58):
Anyway, with that, Boz, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:30:03):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:30:04):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:30:09):
The Dream Machine, which is a tremendous history of pre-history, really of modern computing ostensibly following the life of J.C.R Licklider, but really it's much broader than that, is a tremendous missing piece of history in my opinion. I think in my discipline, in computer science, we were not properly educated. We learned about Alan Turing and we learned about some of the technical underpinnings of computer science theory, but the modern computer and the path to it is a profound and fascinating one, and it has particular resonance today as J.C.R Licklider's observation was human in the loop computing and I think we are now in human in the loop AI, and I think there's a tremendous resonance there. The second one is Good Inside, which is Dr. Becky's book, and again, I think it's a tremendous parenting book, but more than that, it does contain lessons for how we think about our own emotions and how we manage those, which I find to be useful in any context.

Lenny (01:31:00):
Amazing recommendations. She's also got an online community for people that-

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:31:03):
She has a wonderful online community, she's very engaged in it. And for those parents out there, you're a little early for this Lenny, but you'll get there. Having little scripts that I'm reading on Instagram that when I'm in a moment of tremendous emotional challenge with my children, I have the words handy. They're just top of mind for me. They've been cashed in, right? They're primed, is a big game changer.

Lenny (01:31:24):
This will be for our parenting episode down the road.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:31:27):
That's right.

Lenny (01:31:28):
Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:31:32):
Yeah. This is super conventional, but Mandalorian. One of the things that's been fun about that is really my kids again is we watched it with my kids, so we had a chance to go on the Galactic Star Cruiser. Again, y'all know I am a genuine and true nerd through and through. Huge fan of Scott Trowbridge and his work at Star Wars service lands in Disney and also of that. And so before that we got our kids who were nine and six and watched all the movies together, and then we were watching Mandalorian together as a family, and it's super fun and it's fun to have that kind of lore, a connection. So it's not just the classic kids movies, but there's something more, and I think for them they feel like it's an adult kind of conversation they get to be a part of. I've really enjoyed that. And I think the world of Dave Filoni and John Favreau and the team that's building that universe out.

Lenny (01:32:19):
This is the way.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:32:19):
This is the way.

Lenny (01:32:20):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:32:25):
One of the most important things that I always ask people is what people who've worked with them would say are their greatest strengths and weaknesses. I like this for a couple of reasons, not least of which is I often do follow up with references and I like to triangulate their awareness of how other people calibrate though. And also how they respond to criticism. Sometimes candidates surprise me. They say, "Hey, you'll hear this critique a lot from me. I don't think it's fair." That can be an okay answer, but they've got to be a pretty robust there. Or it's like, "Hey, this is something I'm working on, here's what I'm working on." But I also like to hear what they think their superpowers are. And too often a lot of attention in interviews is paid to weaknesses, which I care about because I want to know what the downside is. But way more important to me is like, "What are you awesome at? What is the thing that if I can just hitch a wagon and ride, that's what I want to know. Where's the superpower that you're crushing it at?"

(01:33:22):
And what's funny is people are pretty rarely give my reference checks. They're not that often accurate about what the critiques are, but they're usually pretty accurate about what their strengths are.

Lenny (01:33:31):
Interesting. I'm also a huge proponent of strengths and not worrying too much about your weaknesses.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:33:36):
But asking people to contextualize their performance through the team, that's so important. We do not achieve very much on our own.

Lenny (01:33:44):
Communication is the job. Amazing. Is there a favorite product that you recently discovered that you love? And Meta products are acceptable answers.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:33:55):
The Ray-Ban Meta glasses would be a tempting answer. The multimodal stuff, which I'm going to get in trouble because I've been teasing this for months on social media and it's still a closed beta, and it's like, "We're growing the beta slowly," but it's like, "People already really badly want it." It was probably one of the most magical things I've gotten to try recently. It's not totally fair because it's also not you can buy the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and very soon, I won't say when, but very soon they'll have this capability, but it's more fun to think outside of the box. All right, this is such a... I'm going to get in trouble for this answer because it's a bit of a pretentious one. I'm not a car guy, let me say that right now. I don't like cars. I don't care about cars. I want a car that works and doesn't break. All my cars growing up, had over a hundred thousand miles in them because we only ever had used cars.

(01:34:38):
They were constantly breaking down and the power steering would go out while you're driving and you have to [inaudible 01:34:43] the thing and the brakes would go out or you'd throw a rod. I've done it all. I just wanted a car. And so then I drove a Honda Accord that I bought for 10 years and then I drove a Tesla Model S for 10 years. And a Tesla model S had a thing happen to it while it was parked, I will get into that. I get a new car and again, I'm like, "I want to get an electric car." And I was like, "I'm going to get something nice. I'm going to get something nice. I want to get something nice." I'm driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS, and I didn't know cars could be this nice. I grew up driving used cars and whatever, I did not know it was possible. It is the best augmented reality product I think you could buy in the market today.

(01:35:29):
With the heads of display, it puts your turn in three-dimensional space. It's got cameras facing your eyes, so it's positioned correctly on this display relative to your eyes, the turn. And so when you come up, it's like you're hitting a little wall, you got to turn before you hit the wall. And I was like, "Oh my God, I think this car has a great augmented reality." Not a car guy, and I'm not trying to flex on this car or whatever it is. I like it a lot. I didn't know they could be that nice, but the thing that I thought was so impressive was they did an amazing job with augmented reality in this car.

Lenny (01:35:58):
Wow. Mercedes-Benz, a player in the augmented reality, mixed reality space.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:36:01):
Big time. They're out there, they're in the lead.

Lenny (01:36:04):
I sometimes think about having a contest where I give away products people mention in this segment, and now you've blown my budget way out of proportion.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:36:12):
Ray-Ban Metas, you can afford that.

Lenny (01:36:15):
That's an amazing, I'm going to have to check that out. I think we're going to increase some sales for Mercedes. Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to think about, share with friends and family, find useful?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:36:27):
Yeah. We have a funny actually how we came about this. The motto my family has, my immediate family, me, my wife and kids is just trust yourself. Just trust yourself. Actually, the reason we have that motto is when we have a house, we have a few nice art pieces and one of them is a Tracy Amen, a famous UK based artist, and she does neon pieces and it says, "Trust yourself." And so it's in our bedroom hallway where me and all the kids and my wife are, it says, trust yourself and every morning the neon lights up and it's trust yourself. And then I had the chance to have a crest made in the UK and my family's English from way back. And so in the crest it says, "Trust yourself." And I always talk to my kids, especially. I really think people, when you're experiencing peer pressure like, "Who do you trust? Them or yourself? When you're having a lot of self-doubt and uncertainty, you have to trust yourself."

(01:37:17):
I just think so much of the success I've had, I think this is probably true of most people who went to startups and succeeded, was like, "I just had faith that I was making good decisions." I mean, this comes back to the conviction point I made earlier about how you do things like newsfeed or controversial things or how you make big expensive changes, just conviction. You have to believe you, your eyes, ears in an intellect have combined to give you a point of view that has intrinsic value and deserves your respect as opposed to reading that newspaper article about your company and believing it over what your own eyes and ears have told you. That's the motto that we go with.

Lenny (01:37:57):
And I think it's also important to say you won't always be right and that's okay.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:37:59):
Totally. That's right. Trusting yourself also includes taking risks because you trust that you can deal and handle with what happens when the risks don't pay out.

Lenny (01:38:07):
Beautiful. Final question. I know that you're an amateur photographer, maybe semi-pro photographer, a lot of travel photography.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:38:13):
Amateur. Amateur, amateur.

Lenny (01:38:15):
Amateur. Okay. You also have this website that I came across that I don't know if people know about it, it's this funny name. I'm not going to mention that. I don't know if you want people...

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:38:22):
Warden Shortbow, it's an anagram of my name. Warden Shortbow, an anagram of Andrew Bosworth, wardenshortbow.com. I love photography. I love it. It's a real passion of mine.

Lenny (01:38:30):
So here's the question. What's your favorite photo that you've taken?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:38:33):
Art is actually a great place to talk about trusting yourself, by the way. And I know it's cheesy to say it, but I think Rick Rubin's recent interviews on what art is and how people make it is spot on. You have to make it for yourself and you have to love it. And if someone else loves it and it finds broader resonance, that's awesome, but that's not why you do it. And if you start to try to do it for broader resonance, then you're kind of chasing something else. It's media, it's entertainment, but it's not art. It's some other thing. And I say all this to basically tap dance and say, I kind of love a lot of my photos and it's very hard to pick a favorite. The one that is popping to my head, which has more emotional [inaudible 01:39:12] is a picture I took of my son playing in the street and just jumping in a puddle, wearing a rain boot, rain slick kind of a thing. And it's not sharp, it's not in focus. It's a vignette, it's an idea.

(01:39:27):
And I really do think Ansel Adams talked a lot about how the goal of the photographer is to create a capture that expresses to the viewer what it felt like to be there. And people forget that he was a master of the dark room even more so than maybe than the capture, the print. The print was where he did amazing work. And I've had the pleasure to go to his dark room in Big Sur and spend time with his son and watch them do development in that room. And he had elaborate scripts of how he would highlight, dodge and burn different parts of the photograph to get it to have the resonance that he wanted. And he fought for photography to be accepted as an artistic medium, which it wasn't, which I find so resonant in today's AI art conversations where once again, we're trying to gate keep what is art and you just don't get to do that unfortunately.

(01:40:20):
So this picture of my son, no one would call it a technical marvel, but as a vignette of it capturing for me personally, but also I think in general for parents, the ephemerality of these tremendously touching, charming human moments that you have with your children, that's the one that comes to mind.

Lenny (01:40:39):
Amazing. We're going to try to find it and link folks to it. And on the point of Rick Rubin, something he says along the same lines is that you think of art as your diary. I am just describing what I find interesting and important and nobody can come to me and say my diary is wrong. It's my diary, this is how I see the world, and that's okay. And that's where the best art comes from is just emboldening to this... there's an awesome video of him saying exactly this that I was recently watching actually. Boz, this was so much fun. I am so thankful we made time for this. I'm looking forward to our parenting and relationships podcast in the future. Joking, not joking. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:41:19):
Sure. I'm @boztank on Instagram and on Threads and also on X, facebook.com/boz. And I also have my own podcast, which is a technical deep dive, so it's pretty different, I would say. It's a technical deep dives to try to go deep on one or two topics each time. That's called Boz to the Future. You can find that on Spotify or iTunes.

Lenny (01:41:41):
Boz to the Future, buy some Quest stuff.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:41:44):
Get yourself a Quest 3. Let's be honest. Dude, treat yourself.

Lenny (01:41:48):
There you go. Or these Ray-Ban sunglasses. I'm a big fan. Boz, again, thank you so much for being here.

Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:41:52):
Cheers. Thanks, brother.

# Why experts writing AI evals is creating the fastest-growing companies in history | Brendan Foody

## Transcript

Brendan Foody (00:00:00):
The wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):
We are entering the era of evals.

Brendan Foody (00:00:07):
We started working with all of the top AI labs. What the labs need is labor marketplace. They actually need extraordinary professionals that can measure model capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):
They found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history.

Brendan Foody (00:00:20):
We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, fastest ascent in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
Why is this so valuable?

Brendan Foody (00:00:29):
The market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. The lab's primary bottleneck to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
There's this tweet that you retweeted. "If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs."

Brendan Foody (00:00:49):
It's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts. And I think the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, but very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):
I talked to a lot of people about what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better?

Brendan Foody (00:01:12):
How can they leverage this technology to do so much more? We'll give people interviews where we say, "Use whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):
Today, my guest is Brendan Foody, CEO and co-founder of Mercor. Mercor is the fastest-growing company in history to go from 1 to $500 million in revenue. They did this in 17 months, less than a year and a half. Brendan is also the youngest unicorn founder ever. They just raised $100 million at $2 billion valuation. Mercor, if you haven't heard of them, helps AI labs and AI companies hire experts to help them train their models using AI. They've never had a customer churn, their net retention is over 1,600%, and they're on a nine-figure revenue run rate.

(00:01:59):
In our conversation, we talk about the increasing value and importance of evals, the landscape of AI training companies like Mercor, and why they've become so important and valuable, how Brendan discovered this opportunity, his insights on what product market fit looks like, the core tenets he's instilled within his organization that have allowed him to build the fastest growing company in history, what people writing evals for labs are actually doing day to day, which skills and jobs are going to last the longest with the rise of AI, why he doesn't think we'll see AGI or superintelligence anytime soon, and so much more. This episode is incredible. You need to hear this.

(00:03:01):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(00:03:32):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for auth zero and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:04:18):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible.

(00:04:38):

(00:05:42):
Brendan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brendan Foody (00:05:45):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny. I'm a huge fan, and so excited to have a conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
I'm really excited to have this conversation as well. I'm a huge fan of yours. I'm excited for more people to learn about you and what you're building.

(00:05:57):
I want to start with a tweet that you have pinned at the top of your Twitter feed right now, and here's the tweet. "We are now working with six out of the Magnificent 7, all of the top five AI labs, most of the AI application layer companies. One trend is common across every customer. We are entering the era of evals."

(00:06:19):
The reason this caught my attention is that's one of the most recurring trends on this podcast, people talking about the increasing value of learning how to do evals well and the value of evals for companies. It feels like still people don't know what the hell this is what we're talking about, why this is so important. Talk about just what you think people are still missing, what they need to know, what this era of evals means.

Brendan Foody (00:06:39):
If the model is the product, then the eval is the product requirement document. And the way that researchers' day-to-day looks is that they'll run dozens of experiments where they'll make small improvements on an eval set. And reinforcement learning is becoming so effective that once they have an eval, they can help climb it. If you look at just how fast people were able to saturate Olympiad Math once they focused on it, how fast we're even saturating SWE-bench once we focus on it. And so in many ways, the barrier to applying agents the entire economy to automate every workflow is how do we measure success? How do we eval it? And write the PRDs for everything that we want agents to do, which Mercor is obviously a huge part of doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:25):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Oh, yeah. Okay, shit. I got to really pay attention to this eval stuff." Any advice about learning how to do this well? What companies that are doing this well are doing differently? Help people get better at this thing.

Brendan Foody (00:07:39):
Yeah. I think that for enterprises especially, the core way to think about it is how can they build a test or systematic way to measure how well AI automates their core value chain? So if it's an architecture firm that's producing these architecture diagrams of what they provide to their end customer, how can they effectively measure that? And each company has its own value chain or maybe a handful of them if it's a multi-product company. And just thinking about how they measure that is the prerequisite to really effectively applying AI throughout their entire business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):
I saw you talking about this on the No Priors podcast with Sarah and Elad, and I don't know if it was after this or before this, but Sarah tweeted, "Evals equals your new marketing." What does that mean? What do you think she's saying there?

Brendan Foody (00:08:32):
Yeah. Well, it ties to what I said earlier about how if the model is the product, evals are the PRD, but also subsequently the sales collateral, right? Because evals are what you give to researchers to show them what they should be building and going on, but they're also the way that you demonstrate the efficacy of capabilities.

(00:08:51):
And historically, everyone's been pointing to these academic evals of PhD level reasoning with GPQA, Humanity's Last Exam, or Olympiad Math, but now it's moving towards the capabilities that people practically care about of how do we get models to automate the way that we build a software platform or automate the way that we do an investment banking analysis. And I think labs as well as application layer companies will increasingly use evals to demonstrate the capabilities of their models and their products.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:26):
Okay. So let's build on this and zoom out a little bit and talk about the landscape of the market that you're in. And I was just reflecting on this as I was preparing for this conversation. If you think about the companies growing faster than any company's ever grown in history, there's essentially three buckets. There's the foundational model companies, there's vibe coding apps, Cursor and Loveable and Bolt and Replit and all these here, and then there's data labeling data companies like you. So I've had the CEO of Handshake on the podcast. I have the CEO of Scale coming on. There's also Surge. There's you guys. Help us just understand the landscape of what this is all about because I think people don't really know what the hell's going on and see all these companies growing like crazy.

Brendan Foody (00:10:06):
Yeah, I'll give a little bit of the origin story, incorporate in that and how it frames the landscape. Because when we started the company, I met my co-founders when we were 14 years old. We started the company together when we were 19 initially, in January 2023, initially hiring people internationally, matching them with our friends and automating all the processes of how we did that. So similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decided to hire. We automated all of those processes with LLMs, bootstrap the company to a million dollar revenue run rate before we dropped out of college.

(00:10:40):
And then a handful of other things happened, but we met OpenAI and we saw that there was this enormous transition in the human data market where it was moving away from this crowdsourcing problem of how do you find low and medium skilled people that can write barely grammatically correct sentences for early versions of LLMs and moving towards this sourcing and vetting problem. How do we source and assess the best professionals, the experienced? Think software engineers, the investment bankers and doctors and lawyers that can actually help to evaluate and interpret all of the capabilities that people want models to have.

(00:11:21):
So from there, we start working with all of the top AI labs. We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, and it's been an extraordinary journey and super exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:36):
Okay. First of all, that is out of control. I don't know if people understand. I think this is the first time you're sharing that number. I know we're recording this, you'll have announced it by now, but 1 to 400 million in revenue in 16 months.

Brendan Foody (00:11:49):
Exactly. So fastest ascent in history, which is an exciting statistic we're very proud of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
Okay. So something big is happening here. Why is this so valuable? What is going on here? So it's just to try to summarize what you guys do simply is you help hire people for labs to help them train their models, and you help them find not just generalist labor, but experts, helping them with very specific gaps in the model's knowledge.

Brendan Foody (00:12:21):
Yeah, precisely. And so it really ties to your first question around the era of evals that's framing all of this, which is that the lab's primary bottleneck to being able to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model, both to use it as the eval for the tests that they're measuring their progress against, as well as the verifiers in an RL environment to then reward the model, improve capabilities, et cetera. And they need this across every domain for every capability that models don't know how to use. And the wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities where Mercor is sitting at the forefront and the primary bottleneck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:12):
Okay, what are these people actually doing? So what's an example of a kind of person that is sought after? And then what are they doing sitting there at the computer?

Brendan Foody (00:13:19):
Effectively, the market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. So I'll make that very concrete. Say you have a model that you want to write a red line for a contract in the way that a lawyer would, and it makes a handful of mistakes, misses a bunch of key points in doing so. What you could do is have a lawyer create a rubric similar to how a professor might create a rubric to create a deliverable for what are the things we want the model to be able to do?

(00:13:50):
So it can effectively score that, right? Plus however much of it identifies this or XYZ key point. And that's really the foundation to measuring what does progress look like for models? Is this model achieving the capabilities that these professionals want? As well as how do we use this as training data to reward and to reinforce a lot of the capabilities that people want models to achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:19):
Okay, so they're essentially writing evals just to connect it back to original conversation.

Brendan Foody (00:14:23):
Exactly. Well, that's an interesting thing is everyone talks about RL environment. I feel like the two hot button things are like RL environments and evals, but one thing like Andrej Karpathy's tweeted out about a bunch is there's not actually a nuance. It's in the data type. It's more just a different semantic way of describing what it's being used for. But ultimately, it's just some stasis point for how do you measure what good looks like? And you can use that either as the benchmark to the sales collateral, as Sarah was saying, to say, here is why are models the best model in the world and here's the capabilities that we've been working towards, or you can use it on the post-training side to reward certain model trajectories and achieve those capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Okay. So say this lawyer, this person is writing, "Here's what a great red line contract looks like and here's the rubric of what excellent is." Then are they also providing data, like actual examples of red line documents as a part of that?

Brendan Foody (00:15:22):
They may. The data landscape historically has included two kinds of data. The first is supervised fine-tuning data, which is input/output. When people think about fine-tuning in the historical sense, that's what it is. The second is RLHF where the model will generate a couple of examples. We'll choose which is the most popular example.

(00:15:43):
What everyone is generally moving towards is reinforcement learning from AI feedback instead of human feedback where you have instead the human defined some sort of success criteria, some way to measure that. And examples in code, it could be a unit test. We can scalably measure success and other domains that could be a rubric. And then you use that to incentivize model capabilities. And it's far more scalable and data-efficient, and so that's why a lot of the broader trend in the market across the board is moving towards RLHF to both eval models as well as improved capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:24):
I had one of the co-founders of Anthropic on. He said exactly the same thing. That's what they've done at Anthropic, is move towards AI-driven reinforcement learning.

(00:16:32):
So essentially, if I can understand this correctly, I'm the lay person here trying to understand this on behalf of the audience. So essentially a lawyer is like, "Here's what correct looks like for redlining," and then it's AI is just on its own almost, just like, "I'm going to try to get this. I'm going to try to improve on this and I know if I'm heading the right direction based on this eval/rubric I've been given."

Brendan Foody (00:16:55):
Exactly. Applying all of the criteria of what good looks like similar to how the TA might apply the professor's criteria of does the student's response meet this criteria or this criteria plus however many planes, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:10):
Awesome, okay. Let me shift to talking about the broader labor market here. So there's two parts to this question as we talk about this. One is just how long will we need to do this? You guys grew so incredibly fast. Is there a point of like, "Okay, we don't need humans. We're tapped out." So let's start there and then I'll ask a broader question.

Brendan Foody (00:17:29):
So the key question is how long there's going to be things in the economy that humans can do that AI can't do? And I think there's certainly a bucket of people that say we're going to have superintelligence within three years and humans won't play a role in the economy. And that's one school of thought.

(00:17:46):
Our perspective is very different. Our perspective is that these models are extraordinary and automating a lot of things very quickly, but there's a lot of things that they're horrible at. Even still, it can't schedule time on my calendar. It can't draft emails for me. It can't use basic tools. And we need evals for everything. For everything that the models can't do, we need evals for the tool use, evals for the long horizon reasoning.

(00:18:12):
Imagine in 10 years when we want models to be able to go out and build a startup for 30 days. We need evals for that to effectively reward it. And I think that that road to improving models will last for as long as there is anything in the economy that humans can do which models can't and be a huge portion of what the future of work looks like. And so our mission is creating the future of work, and I think that this is a really exciting industry and giving us a glimpse into the direction that everything is headed towards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):
There's this tweet that you retweeted that I want to ask you about. "If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs."

Brendan Foody (00:18:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:00):
What does that mean to you? What is this person implying? And it's basically what you're saying is we're just helping train models.

Brendan Foody (00:19:06):
It speaks to conversations I've had with a lot of researchers and executives at top labs, which is that it's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts for us to then have rubrics or other kinds of verifiers. And that is really exciting in so many ways.

(00:19:32):
Because I think let's draw an analog to other revolutions where when we had the industrial revolution, everyone was freaking out about losing their jobs, but there was this whole new class of jobs of how do we build the machines? How do we have knowledge work? How do we create everything new? And I think that the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, right? Sure, there's ChatGPT is growing fast and it's very cool that everyone loves using it, but from an economic standpoint, people talking a lot about job displacement. But very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created and what that's going to mean and how people can prepare and upskill for that. And I think that the most exciting thing possible is creating that future of how do humans fit into the economy and how will that evolve over time?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):
I talk to a lot of people about just what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better? People in school right now are just like, "What is even going to be valuable in the future?" You're at the center of a lot of just what jobs are most in demand, how hiring is evolving. So let me just ask you a very concrete question. What jobs do you think will remain in the future/what skills are still worth investing in for younger people, especially?

Brendan Foody (00:20:47):
In terms of jobs, I would respond with a category of things that have very elastic demand are going to be super exciting. Because when we make people 10 times more productive, we'll build 10 times, if not 100 times as much software as an example. And so I think the product managers that can now do so much more are going to be extremely well-positioned. And so far as the skills, I think it's people that can leverage AI to do whatever their day-to-day workflows are.

(00:21:16):
I have had a couple conversations with teachers where they get my thoughts on how they should be assessing their students because we originally started out curating all of these AI interviews and assessments for people and have thought about this immensely. And what we realized is that you don't want to fight against them using the models. It's similar to when the calculator came out, you don't want to give people all of this arithmetic work of how do you get them to do it and not use the calculator. You want to tell them, "Use the tools and let's see what you can do."

(00:21:49):
And so we'll give people interviews where we say, "Use ChatGPT and Kodak. Use Claude code. Use whatever tool cursor and whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour." And so I think that I give that an example in so far as talent assessment because I think it pertains also to the skills that people should be honing in on of how can they leverage this technology to do so much more in whatever industry or vertical they're operating in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:17):
When you talk about elastic, being elastic, is it generalists being good at just a bunch of different things, or what do you say? What do you mean when you think elastic?

Brendan Foody (00:22:25):
So I more mean how much capacity for demand there is in that industry. So I'll give a couple of examples. In accounting, I think realistically we only need so much accounting in the world. Maybe there's areas where we can do more and that'll be good, but it doesn't feel like the world needs 100 times more accounting.

(00:22:46):
On the other hand, in software development, I think we can ship 100 times more features for our products, move 100 times faster, build so much more. There's just it feels like there's unlimited demand for the industry. And I think Mark Andreessen tweeted about this recently, that software is the most elastic industry of all where when we increase productivity, there's so much more that will be built. And it's definitely characteristic of a lot of other domains as well. And so I would focus on those domains where if we make everyone 10 times more productive, that'll increase demand, not reduce it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):
Okay. So you're in the bucket of learn to code, still useful as a skill. You take computer science. And so in terms of elastic categories of jobs, sounds like engineering, product management is in that bucket. Great. A lot of people listening to this are PMs. What else, like design users? I don't know. What else do you feel is in that bucket from what you've seen?

Brendan Foody (00:23:44):
Yeah, I think that there's a lot of things where the whole value chain of building companies has a lot of these variable costs, even large portions of operations or consulting. Imagine if we could have 10 times as many McKinsey consultants, what would be possible in so far as the research we could do, the analysis, et cetera. But I think the companies and people that are going to succeed are those that lean into this narrative of abundance of how do we do so much more rather than fighting back against it of how do we try to stop displacement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):
So along those lines, I think about your second bucket, which is the people that will be most successful. It's not like a specific skill, but it's being good with AI, using AI to become better at what you're already doing. This reminds me of Elon's whole thing with Neuralink, which I don't know if this is how we put it, but the way I've always heard it is you wanted to build Neuralink because in the future when AGI and superintelligence is around, we need a way to compete and the best way to compete is plug our brains into a superintelligence so we have a chance. And it feels like that's what AI is. Getting good at AI tools is essentially is having this super superpower.

Brendan Foody (00:24:58):
Figuring out how to leverage them and incorporate it will definitely be of paramount importance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):
It just comes back to this almost cliche quote now. It's, "AI won't replace you. People that are really good with AI will replace you."

Brendan Foody (00:25:10):
I think it's totally spot on. And I've definitely seen this at the enterprise level as well where there's certain enterprises we talk to that are almost fearful not wanting to engage, not wanting to eval their businesses because that'll provide the evidence that their value chain is being automated. And there's others that... Literally some of the most recognized sophisticated Fortune 500 businesses that have this mentality and there's others that are leaning into it of if we have the ability to do 10 or 100 times more, what will that mean and how do we lean into that future? Because there's so many things that are going to change over the next 10 years, and I think those are the kinds of businesses that are going to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):
Let's talk about labor markets more broadly. You guys, so it's interesting though. You started not feeding people to AI labs, not training models. It was just like help people find jobs, help companies hire, and then you're like, "Oh wow, this whole opportunity." You have this really interesting view on the future of just labor markets and hiring. Talk about that.

Brendan Foody (00:26:14):
Yeah, it's interesting. I remember when we started the company, as I mentioned, we were 19, and just had this gut intuition that it felt so wildly inefficient that labor markets are so disaggregated. And what I mean by that is when we would hire someone internationally, they would apply to a dozen jobs. When we as a company in the Bay Area were considering candidates, we would consider a fraction of a percent of candidates that were available in the market. And the reason for that is that there was this matching problem that everyone's solving manually where they'll manually review resumes, they'll manually conduct interviews, and manually decide who to hire. But when we're able to automate that matching problem at the cost of software, it makes way for this global unified labor market that every candidate applies to and every company hires from facilitating a perfect flow of information in the economy.

(00:27:08):
And I think that that future is undoubtedly what we're heading towards, but what we've realized over time is that the nature of work is also changing dramatically. And part of building that future over a 10-year time horizon is creating that future of work and all of the more tactical things we do and building these incredible data sets across evals and RL environments for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
What I've seen in how hiring has changed, I'm doing research on this with a partner, Gnome, it's so much easier to apply for companies that everyone's just applying now, to hundreds of companies. AI is just making it easy to adjust their resumes and cover letters and make it feel like, "Oh, I applied to more of course very specifically, but it was one of 100 places." And then on the flip side, hiring managers are getting flooded with applications and so now they need AI to filter. So even if we didn't want to get to this place, we're almost being pushed into this direction of so much volume on both sides. We need something really smart at filtering and helping us hire and select, and this is exactly what you guys have been building for a long time.

Brendan Foody (00:28:13):
Precisely, yeah. And the fascinating thing a lot of people ask, do we think about ourselves as a labor marketplace or do we think about ourselves as a data company? And I think that the reason it's an interesting question is our realization on from what the labs need is that they actually need a labor marketplace. They actually need these exceptionally high caliber people. And of course we'll layer on some project management and some software platform associated with it. But the really core thing that they want is how do they find these extraordinary professionals across all of these different domains that can measure model capabilities and work to build that future work together?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):

(00:29:55):
Going back to just how this all works and what you guys do for models, I was talking to a friend who had an ankle sprain or his foot was hurting and he got an x-ray and he fed the x-ray into ChatGPT and then asked him, "Give me this specific x-ray." And it's like, "Okay, sure." And then it gave him, "Here's what you have." And he was talking to me, he's like, "What is out there on the internet that trained this model to know this stuff?" And I was like, "No, it's actually somebody sitting there helping the model understand this. Once they recognize, it doesn't fully understand this. Humans are actually helping them learn these things."

Brendan Foody (00:30:29):
Exactly. Well, so the way it works, at least what most people's understanding is there's a lot of complexity in how the models work, is that pre-training gets a lot of the knowledge into the model of what are all the different things that see into the world. And then post-training and reinforcement learning is for all of the reasoning of what are the pieces of knowledge that are accurate, what are inaccurate, and what to prioritize at any given time to make a decision. And so behind that, there would've been radiologists that worked on the post-training data set to create some stasis point for here's the diagnosis and rewards and penalties associated with it. And it's really the quality of those people that went into the quality of the decision and recommendation that ChatGPT ultimately made.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
So let's actually follow that, right, because that's really interesting and I don't know how many people understand it. I understand it. So the work that you do and these experts do is post-training. It's not feeding data into the model that it's trained on. It's, "We have this model GPT-5. Now here's all the things that's missing. Let's add to it."

Brendan Foody (00:31:31):
Exactly, yeah. It's really unlocking, allowing the model to focus on all the right tokens, from pre-training all the right things in model context, up weighting the effective reasoning chains to enable the models to reason better in a more generalized way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
What's the scale of people just working on the stuff. It's like thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands?

Brendan Foody (00:31:53):
Tens of thousands at any given time, hundreds of thousands more generally. It's huge. And the most exciting thing is that it's growing really quickly. I think that to your question also about the competitive landscape, historically there were all these crowdsourcing companies that would get these super high volumes of low-skilled people. I think Scale and Surge were the primary companies that pioneered that industry. And then in this transition to higher-skilled labor, what people realized is that actually you can go a lot further with just getting higher caliber people even in smaller amounts initially, and now subsequently scaling that back up once they're able to meet the quality bar.

(00:32:35):
And I think that there's a bunch of companies that after our success and very rapid revenue growth that started early last year have chased after that, which makes sense. And seeing that the market was changing very quickly, we were taking off, and trying to pursue a similar thesis on the market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):
It's interesting. There's always been these companies, AlphaSights and GLG, that did this before AI or is paid to connect to an expert and ask them questions about stuff. And essentially, okay, it turns out this is really useful for models. We don't need the person in the middle.

Brendan Foody (00:33:11):
Exactly, yeah. Well, but one core difference is that AlphaSights would generally be a one-off call versus a lot of our work is really hiring people for projects of how do they work on something for a longer period of time. And so that's, I think, one of the reasons that some of the traditional expert networks have struggled to get into this. And also how do you retain those people and think about all the incentives where it actually looks more similar in some ways to one of the traditional labor marketplaces of an Uber or DoorDash, just with much higher-skilled talent that's treated exceptionally well?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):
It's such a good opportunity for me to learn so much about this, so I'm going to ask questions.

Brendan Foody (00:33:55):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
It's so interesting to me. How much of the experts are focused on specific concrete knowledge versus personality and softer skills? How much of it's like, "Here's how you do an exam. Here's how you do an x-ray"?

Brendan Foody (00:34:09):
It depends on the lab. It's a lot of both. I think that previously it might've been more softer skills, but now a lot of the labs are focused on their business models of what are the economically valuable capabilities that drive revenue and leaning a lot into these professional domains. But I think the creative side is also still really important to everyone. And so we're seeing a meaningful amount of both. We hired all the people from the Harvard Lampoon a couple of months ago, their comedy club, to help with making models funnier. And so do all sorts of stuff like that, hiring Emmy award-winning screenwriters and everything across the board on creative capabilities that you'd look for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):
That is amazing. What a cool story. I'm excited for this to kick in. How fast do these things turn around? Say you hired this team, how fast are we going to see the impact potential? Is like months? Is it years?

Brendan Foody (00:35:03):
Well, so it depends, because some models or some labs will release iteratively where they'll just improve the model behind the scenes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:11):
Without announcing a new model?

Brendan Foody (00:35:12):
Exactly. Every couple of weeks versus others do these big releases. And so it depends a lot. We're behind all of them, but we move really fast. It would be a customer gives us a request of we need these award-winning screenwriters, and within 24 hours we'll turn around the experts. And then there's also this really interesting dynamic where in a set of 100 people that we hire, oftentimes the top 10% of people will drive majority of the model improvement. It's like a company. If you have 100-person company, oftentimes the top 10% of the company will drive majority of the impact. And what that means is that when we're able to build proprietary advantages in identifying who are those top 10% of people, both in so far as how do we have them on our platform but also identify and match them effectively, it creates so much value for customers that it's difficult to compete against.

(00:36:08):
And so it really does tie back to the founding thesis of the company, which is how do we find these extraordinary people and identify them so that we can reliably deliver these top 10% or top 10X experiences for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:25):
So on that, so is the idea, you hire Jane. She's incredible at coding and she now works for Anthropic and that's her full-time job doing this? Or is this a part-time thing? Is this a project thing mostly?

Brendan Foody (00:36:38):
It would sometimes be part-time. Sometimes it would be full-time. I would say most often it's part-time where it's like someone might work at a thing company where they're underemployed, maybe one of the ones that's moving slower where they have an extra 20 hours a week and then they're able to do this on the side or whatever the equivalent is across a bunch of different industries. But we also do a lot of 40 hour a week roles as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):
And how much are they making? Is it meaningful enough for a AI engineer to spend time on this?

Brendan Foody (00:37:13):
Yeah, very meaningful. So our median pay rate in the marketplace is $95 an hour, but it can flex up, well up into $500 an hour based on the depth of someone's expertise. And one thing that highlights this difference relative to a lot of the crowdsourcing companies is if you look at the economics of the crowdsourcing companies, oftentimes they would pay $30 an hour to town as the average. And so think about the people that you can hire, the undergrads for $30 now versus the Goldman bankers, the McKinsey analysts, the Fang software engineers. And ultimately it comes down to what are the capabilities that labs want their models to have? And it much more falls in the latter bucket than the former one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):
I know there's only so much you can talk about with this stuff, but so Anthropic, Claude has been so good at coding so much better historically than other models. I also use it for writing, giving feedback on writing. What is it that allowed them to get so good at this and continue to be so good at this?

Brendan Foody (00:38:19):
Well, I can't go too much into detail about customer work, but I think that it's this trend of reinforcement learning and being very thoughtful about defining the right rewards that we're releasing across the board. And how we could mitigate reward hacking, set up the right rewards, that's super impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
Evals. Again, evals is all you need.

Brendan Foody (00:38:44):
Back to evals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):
Yeah.

Brendan Foody (00:38:45):
One of my favorite quotes from customers is that, "Models are only as good as their evals," which has always held true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
I think Greg Brockman tweeted this once. "Evals are all you need."

Brendan Foody (00:38:56):
Yeah, truly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
Let's talk about Mercor a little bit more. One of the maybe, not even maybe, I believe the data tells us it's the fastest growing company in history.

Brendan Foody (00:39:07):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:09):
I want to understand what you did to make this happen. So let me just ask, what do you think are some of the core tenets of how you built Mercor that most contributed to being this successful?

Brendan Foody (00:39:20):
I think the most important thing is looking at the leading indicators in fast-moving markets. I remember when I used to think... Everyone in venture talks about the why now, and I used to think about the why now of how from a product standpoint, less from a market standpoint of now we can automate the way that we review resumes or the way that we conduct interviews, et cetera. But ultimately there is this legacy market that's has all these incumbents and it's relatively stagnant. But what matters a ton is actually figuring out what are the new markets, the new pockets of demand that are changing very quickly where the wealthiest customers in the world are willing to pay whatever it takes to improve model capabilities, and how do we focus on the leading indicators of those markets to make sure that we have the best solution for the flagship customers in the market and optimize everything around that.

(00:40:18):
And that's what I found has been most impactful in building the business. I think maybe that's one thing is leading indicators in markets. If I had to choose another, it's customer obsession. We have had for the last... We're starting to have a couple of product managers help out with go-to-market, but for the last year and a half of the business, we've had no one in sales and marketing. And so we're immature from a sales and marketing standpoint because we focused 100% of company resources on how do we build great products and experiences for our customers. Just getting word of mouth, the people that have worked with us at other businesses want to keep working with us and leaning into creating those great experiences. And so that's where I spend all my time. And I think that some founders can get caught up in how do they get really good at marketing before they've figured out the thing that really drives a lot of customer love and creates the six-star experiences that you're used to building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:19):
I'm going to go back to that first point, which is like, okay, you found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history. How did you first find... What was that moment of, "Wait, this could be really big"?

Brendan Foody (00:41:31):
So there's some crazy stories here. I remember we started the company as I mentioned in January 2023. And then in August 2023 when I was still in college, one of our customers introduced us to the co-founders of xAI over a Zoom call saying how we had these really smart Indian software engineers that were great at math and coding. So we met them and we explained how the software engineers we had were really good at math and coding because they weren't distracted by all the humanities. They didn't have to study history and English and all these other things, and they loved it. So they had us in two days later to the Tesla office and we met the entire xAI co-founding team except for Elon, while I was still a college student. And xAI was just getting started at that point and they were super excited about our focus on the quality of the experts.

(00:42:22):
And so while they were still doing pre-training, they weren't ready for human data at the time and we didn't start working with them at that point. We just knew from that point forward before we even dropped out that the market was about to change radically and we needed to be at the frontier of that. And so then fast-forward a few months, one of the crowdsourcing players came to us and actually used our platform to hire over 1,000 people where this is very interesting experience because we started getting flooded with support tickets about how those people weren't getting paid. And we obviously felt horrible because we had referred them to this opportunity. It was this reputable company. And we realized that a lot of the incumbents were resting on their laurels with respect to what was needed in the experiences they were creating for talent in their marketplaces to help improve models. And there was this opportunity to work directly with the labs in a way that kept the dignity of the experts in the marketplace, paid them extremely well, and cut out the middlemen.

(00:43:31):
And so we started doing that in May of last year, and then the rest is history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:37):
Wow, okay. Hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue since. So what I'm hearing here is you were very open to looking for poll. You saw some poll, you explored it. And then once you saw that there was something really meaningful there, you just went deep on making that an incredible experience as amazing as possible.

Brendan Foody (00:43:57):
Exactly. I think if I had to distill it into advice for founders, one thing I've realized is that I spent a lot of time trying forced product-market fit. And in some ways you should be persistent. You should have these theses that you have conviction about how the world will change. But sometimes you just need to sheer it from the market and know that it's there, the poll, to know the right places to focus. Because if it's difficult to sell, if it's extremely difficult to sell the marginal customer, you're not going to be able to grow a huge business. What you actually need to find is the customer that's surprisingly easy to sell into where you're going to be able to grow with them. You know that it's a large pain point. And so it's some combination of being stubborn with respect to your thesis around how the world will change, but also very open-minded with respect to exactly what form that takes and how the market's developing and how your company will fit into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:55):
That's an amazing insight. In the moments you described, felt like it was a combination of this xAI meeting feeling like, "Oh wow, they really, really want this thing that we have. We're now doing an amazing job," and then it's 1,000 people hiring in the platform. Was that those two moments that are like, "Wow"?

Brendan Foody (00:45:09):
Exactly. And those happened, keep in mind, while we were a seed company, right? Well, so the first one was before we even raised any seed funding, we were totally bootstrapped because we bootstrapped the company to a million dollar revenue run rate and have always remained super capital-efficient. We've never burned money. We were lifetime profitable. And then we raised our seed round in September from General Catalyst, and it was the other experience after we raised our seed round where we really knew that there was an enormous amount of demand in this market where we saw the volume and we saw that the incumbents were sleeping with respect to how the market was changing and the kinds of people that were needed to make that change happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:50):
It's one thing to see this opportunity and start to execute on it. It's another to actually succeed at this scale and consistently win. You guys have very specific values within the business. Talk about those. It feels like that's a big part of your success too.

Brendan Foody (00:46:04):
It totally is. So I'll give the three and maybe a brief story associated with each of them.

(00:46:10):
So the first one is having a can-do attitude, which everyone gives me a little bit of a hard time for because it's a funny saying, but we've always set these ridiculously ambitious goals, and then somehow the trajectory of the company forms around those goals. Where I remember when we were talking to Benchmark before they led our Series A, we were at 1.5 million in run rate. And I said we'd be at 50 million in run rate by the end of the year. And they said we were absolutely insane, right, as anyone would. And plus or minus two weeks, we hit it. And then we've now well blown past the tracking to 500 million in run rate, which was initially our goal for this year. So setting these incredibly ambitious goals with respect to the revenue scale of the business, the caliber of experiences for talent, all those dimensions is super important to first have a can-do attitude.

(00:47:04):
The second thing is really high standards, which is who we hire and what we expect of them. We have an incredibly high hiring bar where we hire tons of former founders, people that have incredible experiences. We just hired or partnered with Sundeep Jain who joined us as president. He was previously the chief product officer and chief technology officer at Uber and joined our relatively small in the grand scheme of things company to help scale up all the processes where Uber is of course the largest labor marketplace in the world. So super high standards is of paramount importance.

(00:47:41):
And then the third one that we really lean on significantly is intensity. And that if you look at the early cultures of the legendary companies, thinking of Meta or Google, they have these incredible, intense early-stage cultures of people just moving heaven and earth and doing whatever it takes to push the frontier of model capabilities. And so still very much output-oriented of what do people achieve rather than input-oriented of the specific hours they work, but recognizing that it takes a lot to build a legendary business, and that's ultimately what we're optimizing for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:18):
I could see why this works. Can-do attitude plus high standards plus intensity, I could see how that leads to success. There's a lot of talk these days about this 6-9-9 culture, working six days a week, 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. A lot of people are like, "Why? That's terrible. Why would you make people do that?" But at the same time, I'm just constantly hearing this from the most successful AI companies. This is just the way it is to be successful. Things are moving so fast. This is an opportunity you'll never see again. Just talk about your thoughts on that.

Brendan Foody (00:48:50):
Yeah. Well, to clarify, we've never mandated hours. It's more been a byproduct of people that care a lot where we care a lot about the trajectory of the business. And so a lot of people come into the office and stay late. But if they need to leave early and get dinner with their kids or travel on the weekend, of course that's totally fine. And for us, it's much more about finding people who have a lot of ownership and are really bought in, less so about the specific hours in the office, even though we found that oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in, not always, but oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in and that burn the midnight oil with us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:30):
When you say high standards, is there something you could share that gives us an example of what you mean there? Because a lot of people think they have high standards and they don't.

Brendan Foody (00:49:37):
If you are very patient, there's always some trade-off between speed and quality when hiring. And I remember especially for our first 10 people, we were just so patient and disciplined about finding some of the best people in the world. Half of them are... Our second employee, Sid, as an example, our second employee in the US, Sid was previously the head of growth at Scale who joined us when we were a seed stage company. Daniel who joined us was previously scaled to consumer apps to over 100,000 users and all sorts of just extraordinary backgrounds of our first 10 hires. And I think that that initial talent density shaped so much of what the rest of the org looks like as you scale it up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:28):
I know you also have this perspective that people talk about waiting to hire, to hire really slowly, but it's actually not necessarily the right advice. Talk about that.

Brendan Foody (00:50:39):
It's painful because it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, I'm thrilled that our first 10 people are so phenomenal and I think that that has paid dividends for the business. But on the other hand, I think that companies do get to the point where you just need to hire really fast. And there's some things where you need a lot of people to do them and you need to recognize that there's going to be some variants associated with hiring, but moving quickly is the priority.

(00:51:07):
And I think that in some ways, we move too slowly with how we scaled out the team. And so the benefit is that everyone is extraordinary. We have this super high bar and we want to maintain that over time. But I think the downside is that while the company has grown incredibly quickly, we likely could have grown even faster if we had moved a little bit more quickly with especially ramping from call, like 10 to 100 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
Okay, I was going to ask. So it sounds like the first 10, be very careful, take your time, 10 to 100, maybe speed up a bit.

Brendan Foody (00:51:44):
Yes, though I wouldn't say it's necessarily 10. It's determined by the point where you know it's really working. And I know that's still not a bright line, but it's like once you know that there's so much more demand than you can handle, that's when you want to step on the gas and optimize for speed in a lot of ways. But I think especially until then, it's important to be patient, be disciplined. Get the best people is always important, but speed becomes more important once you find the market opportunity, the market vacuum.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:20):
I know you've started a couple companies in the past, much smaller scale. In this new role as CEO of this massive hyper growth company, what surprised you most about where you spend the time most or just what the role involves? Because a lot of people want to start companies dream about being in your shoes. What are they maybe not understanding about where a lot of your time goes?

Brendan Foody (00:52:42):
Yeah, it's actually not too surprising. The top two buckets are always working on hiring and time with customers of how do I really deeply understand what customers need and how we can support them? And then how do I build the team and a lot of the processes around that? Of course, there's all of the ad hoc things I didn't expect of dealing with the people questions of how do we set up our levels and our comp bands and all of that, which you learn as you scale a business. But I think that the core places that I spend my time are in line with what I expected as well as what I love doing, which is very fortunate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:27):
So these two companies you've started in the past, maybe share what they work because they're fun, and then how do they help you be successful in this? What's something that they taught you that helped you in your current role?

Brendan Foody (00:53:38):
Yeah, so there's been like a dozen, but I'll choose my favorite two. So when I was in eighth grade, I started Donut Dynasty where I saw that Safeway Donuts were selling for $5 a dozen, and I was amazed because I felt like as an eighth grader, this was such an incredible deal. And I started to bike down to Safeway, buy Safeway Donuts for $5 a dozen, and then go back to my middle school and then sell them for $2 each, running really good margins of course. It sold out super quickly. And so then I need to scale up. So I would pay my mom $20 to drive me in her minivan down to Safeway, buy 10 dozen donuts, go to my middle school, sell them all out.

(00:54:19):
And then the school tried to shut me down because I was selling food on school campus, which they didn't like. So they had me in the principal's office asking me to not do that. And then I moved my donut stand over 50 feet, so it was off school campus, saying that they could no longer police me. I remember we had competitors pop up where the competitors were charging. They bought these Chuck's Donuts, which if anyone in the Bay Area knows, are higher end donuts than Safeway Donuts, but they have a higher cost basis. They cost a dollar per. And so I dropped my prices to $1 for two weeks to run them out of business before I knew what anti-competitive practices were. And I'd hire all my friends, paying my friends in donuts because they perceived the donuts as $2 each where they could sell them throughout the school and I could have a lower cost basis on them.

(00:55:12):
So I had all of these fun experiences in selling donuts, and then I could talk more about my high school business as well, which was a more significant scale. But I think the takeaway from that was just like you can just do things. So many people have ideas, but the barrier to more companies being built, I think, is just initiative and taking the steps to build the product or experience that customers want and investing the time and the ambition to scale that up. And so I think it was really getting reps of that that enabled me to realize that I should do it later on at a much larger scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:51):
Amazing story. I love how wholesome that is versus drugs, selling donuts.

Brendan Foody (00:55:56):
Then my mom was very worried. She was like, "Oh, is there any pot of these donuts?" I was like, "No, mom, I assure you these are pure donuts."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):
I love that you paid your mom $20 to drive.

Brendan Foody (00:56:07):
Yeah. She was adamant it couldn't be a handout that she was taking her time to drive me, so she needed to make a little bit of money off of it. We haggled over her title where eventually she wanted to be head of global operations, which we found very entertaining.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):
I hope that's on her LinkedIn.

Brendan Foody (00:56:24):
Not yet. Maybe she'll have to add it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:27):
So you said that you've started a dozen companies?

Brendan Foody (00:56:29):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):
Wow. Okay.

Brendan Foody (00:56:30):
Well, a dozen projects, but I think it was that, and then my AWS company were the two that I scaled up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:39):
What's the story behind Mercor as the name?

Brendan Foody (00:56:42):
Mercor means marketplace in Latin or to buy, sell, trade. And we want to build the largest marketplace in the world, the marketplace for how everyone finds jobs, and that was really the draw to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):
Okay, maybe a last question. This is going back to earlier in discussion because it's something I've been thinking about as we're talking. There's been this shift from data as the fuel for models, and now it's experts. Do you think there's a next step, or is this just will take us to AGI, superintelligence?

Brendan Foody (00:57:15):
I don't think it's necessarily changing from data to experts. It's more just the paradigm of realizing that labs need this close collaboration with experts to help understand what are the evals that they're building and how can they push the frontier. But I think it's very clear that evals are evergreen, that so long as we want to improve models, we'll need experts to create evals for them and to create the post-training data for them to learn those capabilities. And of course there might be changes in the exact way that people do training with RL or otherwise, but they will always need an eval to measure what does success look like across every domain that they want to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:01):
Okay. So then building on that, a question that comes up a lot these days is, and I know we're talking about fun stuff but I'm getting to serious stuff again, scaling laws and just progression of model intelligence. A lot of people are feeling like, "I don't know, it's slowing down. We're not going to really get to superintelligence at this rate." What is your sense?

Brendan Foody (00:58:21):
I totally agree with that. I know there's been some executives to big labs that say we'll have superintelligence in three years, but I think the truth is that it's a longer road. And that's not to diminish from how extraordinary the models are. I think we'll be able to automate a majority of knowledge work tasks in the next 10 years for sure, but that long road is paved with all of the evals that help to make those capabilities possible. And it's not going to be 10X more pre-training data that gets those capabilities. It's much more going to be all of the post-training data sets that are far more data-efficient and thoughtful that help us get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:05):
David Sachs tweeted this interesting point that the situation we're now is almost the best case scenario where AI is not in this fast takeoff to superintelligence. There's a lot of competitors keeping each other in check. Models are already very valuable and only getting valuable, more valuable, but there's not just this winner superintelligence taking over the world situation.

Brendan Foody (00:59:26):
Yeah, I think that's true. I think a lot of the super intelligence fearmongering is probably overrated, but at the same time a lot of people's framing around that is even if there is a 5 to 10% chance of this P-Doom, then we should be careful, which seems logical. But I think that it's going to be an extraordinary 10 years for all of Silicon Valley and all of the world as this technology is able to create abundance and giving everyone better medical treatment, the best access to legal recommendations, and the ability to build great products more than we've ever seen before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):
And education feels like is transforming.

Brendan Foody (01:00:08):
Absolutely, right. I even have felt bits of this over the last 10 years where I remember ever... My parents would give me a hard time for not going to classes in college and I'd be like, well, there's way better lectures on YouTube. Why not just listen there? But I can only imagine as the models get extremely good at conveying information, better than the best professor, what that'll mean and access to all sorts of information to better forward humanity and upskill everyone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
So I'll use that as a segue to a final question. I'm going to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on the podcast. What's some way that you personally use AI to do better work to help you in life?

Brendan Foody (01:00:52):
Well, let's see. I use it a lot to write documents, as you would expect. I also talk to get advice on problems. I find it helpful to just reason through almost as a thought partner because, yeah, I don't know. I find I think better sometimes when I'm talking something through, but I can't talk through everything with colleagues or people around me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):
And so this is like ChatGPT Voice Mode mostly or something else.

Brendan Foody (01:01:16):
Yeah, I like ChatGPT Voice Mode a lot. There's stuff-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
Me too.

Brendan Foody (01:01:21):
... or room for improvement, but I am very excited about the future of Voice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):
Let me show you something I built, actually. I wasn't planning to talk about this, but there's this guy, Eric Antonow, who's been recommended by a lot of people to get him on this podcast. He's this creative product person that's under the radar now. He's at Facebook for a long time. He built this project called Pirate GPT, which is you basically put ChatGPT into a stuffed animal to talk to it. So built a little wise owl. I don't have it on right now.

Brendan Foody (01:01:25):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):
But basically you sew in a little speaker right here and you put a little magnet underneath and you can put it on your shoulder and then you just talk to it.

Brendan Foody (01:01:57):
That's so cute. Wow. I love it. I'll have to get one of those. Because I have some of the voice assistants in my apartment, but I really want a ChatGPT voice assistant, so I'm excited for-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:07):
I was just thinking that. Yeah, just come on. Why can't we have a ChatGPT voice just sitting around listening to us all the time. And you can't on your phone because it goes to sleep and it's like, "Hello, what?"

Brendan Foody (01:02:17):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:18):
Yeah, so it's what this is trying to be. Well, there's a kickstarter he started that we'll link to that. You could help out.

Brendan Foody (01:02:22):
There we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):
That's really easy.

(01:02:25):
Brendan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on or maybe leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lighting round?

Brendan Foody (01:02:32):
Tying to the point around initiative and that you can just do things, I encourage everyone, especially with AI and it being so much easier to build, just take the initiative to go out and build products and talk with customers and take that leap of faith because I think that that is in so many ways, the largest barrier to more innovation, the economy in any way that we can support that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Yeah. There's so many people that just, let's not bash the podcast, but just listen to podcasts, read posts, just keep reading and listening and don't do anything with that information. And there's never been an easier time to actually build stuff and try stuff.

Brendan Foody (01:03:12):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:12):
So definitely take that advice. Just you can do things. You can move your donut stand 50 feet and get out of their jurisdiction.

Brendan Foody (01:03:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:21):
Okay, Brendan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Brendan Foody (01:03:26):
All set.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Brendan Foody (01:03:31):
Let's see. I would say in order, High Output Management is a phenomenal book on running companies. Second is Zero to One, which of course is a classic. And then third is Shoe Dog, where I just find it to be a really inspirational story.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):
What is a recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Brendan Foody (01:03:49):
I really liked Oppenheimer. My favorite TV show of all time is Suits, so I know not recent, but if I had to choose a recent one, probably Oppenheimer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
Very cool. Suits, first time someone's mentioned that. Favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Brendan Foody (01:04:05):
I love using Codex, like the new version. I know it's sort of new in terms of version. Yeah, I think it's incredible and just a huge, huge improvement. So yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):
Do you have a life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with folks, finding useful in work or in life?

Brendan Foody (01:04:25):
I think it's you can just do stuff, what we were talking about earlier. Take the leap of faith.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
I thought you were going to say can do, which is in your Twitter profile.

Brendan Foody (01:04:34):
Can do as well, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):
Two great ones. Final question. So we were chatting before this about things that we could talk about and you shared this interesting thing that you haven't shared anywhere else, which is that you're dyslexic. Why don't you share that with folks? And just how do you get around that having built the fastest-growing company in history?

Brendan Foody (01:04:55):
I don't hide it at all. I think a lot of my colleagues know. And I think on one hand it definitely makes it difficult to go through 1,000 emails a day or read every document that I'm supposed to, but on the other hand, I feel like it helps me to think a little bit differently, to be more creative, and perhaps see that markets are changing that not everyone sees. And so it's turned out okay so far. And so I think one thing it's helped me realize from a management standpoint is that we focus much more on how we can leverage people's strengths rather than helping to improve weaknesses, because there's some things that I'm not great at and I'll never be the best in the world at, and there's others that I can hopefully refine and strive to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):
That's such a also recurring theme on this podcast of just focusing on strengths and not focusing over all your focus on weaknesses.

(01:05:53):
Brendan, this was incredible. I learned so much. I have a billion more questions, but you got shit to do. Two final questions. What should people know about what you're doing and roles you're hiring for? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Brendan Foody (01:06:06):
Absolutely. We're hiring a ton across the board on our team. We're hiring strategic project leads on our operations team, software engineers in our engineering team, as well as researchers. And so please go to mercor.com and we would love to work with you, and that's the largest way that you can help us. Share it with your friends as well. Over half of people in our marketplace come from referrals because we have a platform of people that love us. And so any jobs that you want to apply to or send your friends to, we would love to have you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):
Brendan, thank you so much for joining me.

Brendan Foody (01:06:39):

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You're CTO of Meta. You are a co-CEO of Salesforce, you're chairman of the board at OpenAI. How do you think the AI market is going to play out?

Bret Taylor (00:00:07):
The whole market is going to go towards agents. I think the whole market is going to go towards outcomes-based pricing. It's just so obviously the correct way to build and sell software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
This makes me think about, I had Marc Benioff on the podcast. You guys were co-CEOs. He was extremely agent-pilled.

Bret Taylor (00:00:21):
It's so hard to sell productivity software, which I learned the hard way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
What's a story that comes to mind when you think about your biggest mistake?

Bret Taylor (00:00:27):
I was the product manager for, it was called Google Local had a pretty tough product review with Marissa and Larry, and to not do that well with a link from the Google homepage is embarrassing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
I think it's really empowering for people to hear it's possible to succeed in spite of a massive failure like this.

Bret Taylor (00:00:41):
They gave me another shot to do the V2 of it that resulted in Google Maps. We got about 10 million people using it on the first day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
What mindset contributed to you being successful in such a variety of roles?

Bret Taylor (00:00:52):
Waking up every morning, what is the most impactful thing I could do today?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Bret Taylor. Bret is an absolute legendary builder and founder. He co-created Google Maps at Google. He co-founded the social network, FriendFeed invented the like button and the real-time newsfeed, which he sold to Facebook. He then became CTO at Facebook. He then started a productivity company called Quip, which he sold to Salesforce for $750 million. He then became co-CEO of Salesforce. He's also currently chairman of the board at OpenAI. At one point he was chairman of the board at Twitter. Today, co-founder and CEO of Sierra an AI started building agent to help companies with customer service sales and more.

(00:01:32):
In our conversation, we cover so much ground, including what skills and mindsets have most helped Bret be so successful in so many roles, why we're all still sleeping on the impact that agents are going to have on the business world. How coding is going to change in the coming years, where the biggest opportunities remain for startups, lessons on pricing and go-to-market in AI, the story behind the like button and so much more. This is a truly epic conversation with a legendary builder.

(00:04:10):
Bret, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Bret Taylor (00:04:14):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:15):
My pleasure. There's so much that I want to talk about. You've done so many incredible things over the course of your career. Just boggles the mind, the things that you've done, and we're going to talk about a lot of that sort of stuff, but I want to actually start with the opposite. I want to talk about a time that you messed up, a time that you screwed up in a big way. We have this recurring segment on the podcast called Fail Corner, and so, I thought it'd be fun to just start there before we get into all the great stuff you've done. What's a story that comes to mind when you think about maybe your biggest mistake in building a product?

Bret Taylor (00:04:43):
It may not be the biggest, but it was my first prominent mistake as a product manager at Google. So for me, it feels big because it was very formative for me as a product designer. So I joined Google in late 2002, early 2003, and I was one of the earliest associate product managers at the company and first, was working on the search system, essentially expanding our index from 1 billion webpages to 10 billion, which was a big deal at the time. It seems quaint now. Then I did a decent job and so my boss, Marissa Meyer, gave me the opportunity to lead a new product initiative, which was a big bet on me and it was both an opportunity to do something for Google, but I was also being pretty scrutinized just as a young new product manager and the premise given to me was work on local search.

(00:05:40):
At the time, the Yellow Pages was still dominant and well, Google was really good at searching the web. It wasn't really good for finding a plumber or a restaurant just because it wasn't really a huge part of the internet at the time. So this content wasn't necessarily on the internet and even if it was, you didn't really want to find plumbers in Manhattan, you wanted to find plumbers in San Francisco, if you're me. And so it was both a technical problem and a product problem and a content problem.

(00:06:11):
We launched the first version of that product that I was the product manager for, was called Google Local and it was, I'll be a little bit more critical now than I might've been at the time, but it was a little bit of a me too version of Yahoo Yellow Pages, essentially grafting on Yellow Pages search on top of Google Search and with a properly crafted query you could see those listings at the top of your search results but a standalone site at local.google.com. Actually, it was an important enough initiative that actually, there was on the Google homepage, it had Web, Images and Local was up there as well, so it's got top bill.

(00:06:54):
I mean you could put almost any link on the Google homepage and get a lot of traffic to it. And despite that, it didn't do that well and to not do that well with a link from the Google homepage is embarrassing. There's not much one can do more than giving you that kind of traffic to give you an add that as a product leader or a product manager. And the product was fine, it worked, but it really wasn't differentiated. And in many ways, I think, again, I think I've had these reflections more sense than at the time, that I had some of the time, but why use this instead of Yahoo Yellow Pages? But more than anything else, why use this instead of the Yellow Pages? It was a digital version of something that had come before. Had a pretty tough product review with Marissa and Larry and others and it was fine. I wasn't about to get fired or something, but it was, I don't know, the shine on my reputation was waning a little bit.

(00:07:52):
And they gave me another shot to do a V2 of it and I got the impression it wasn't like my last shot, but I certainly was feeling a little dejected from going from a hot shot, new PM to a new thing. So, we spent a lot of time thinking about how can you make something that's just much more compelling and not just a digital version of the Yellow Pages and not just so similar to some of the other products out there. And that ended up being the thread that we pulled that resulted in Google Maps. We had licensed from MapQuest, the ability to put this little map next to the search results, it was always the ugliest part of the product and we always made these backhanded comments about it internally and we spent a lot of time saying, what if we inverted the hierarchy here and made the map the canvas?

(00:08:49):
We ended up finding Lars and Jens Rasmussen who had been working on this Windows mapping product and we got them into the company and started exploring this space and it ended up where, through that exploration we ended up integrating a lot of different products. We ended up integrating mapping local search, driving directions, like all of these products at the time were actually separate product categories and ended up with something that redefined the industry and certainly my career. But it took, I think for me as a product leader, it changed the way I think about product just because there's feature and functionality and then there's like why should I use this thing in the first place? And it was notable, there was a couple of interesting moments.

(00:09:34):
When we launched Google Maps we got about 10 million people using it on the first day, which at that scale of the internet at the time was huge. And then in August of 2005, we integrated satellite imagery from a recent acquisition called Keyhole, which became Google Earth and we got 90 million people using it on the same day. Everyone wanted to look at the top of their house when the imagery came out. And it was really interesting because there's so many subtle product lessons in there. First is, I think as you have these new technologies, rather than literally digitizing what came before, if you can create an entirely new experience, it answers the question for a new customer, why should I give this the time of day? And so, really disassembling the Lego set and reassembling into something new rather than just digitizing what was there before. Certainly, that was the lesson I think in Google Maps, really was native to the platform in a way that a paper map couldn't be and that was a really meaningful breakthrough.

(00:10:35):
And then with satellite imagery, it honestly wasn't the most important part of Google Maps, but it was the sizzle to the steak and it created, I don't think the term viral was a thing people said back then, but it created a viral moment. We were on Saturday Night Live, which is the coolest thing. Andy Samberg in, I think it was called Lazy Sunday rapped about Google Maps and Lars and I were texting each other. We did it. We're on Saturday Live. Mission accomplished. And it was also showing that as you're there thinking about products, there's the why you decide to use a product and then what is the enduring value. And those are deeply related but not all the same thing. And I just learned so many lessons that I took with me for every subsequent product that I worked on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):
That is an awesome story. One I think it's really empowering for people to hear, even you Bret, who I'm going to share all the successes you've had, have had a massive failure with the CEO of Google [inaudible 00:11:30] just like Bret, you screwed up. And it was such a big bet. So one, just it's possible to succeed as you have succeeded in spite of a massive failure like this. And then some of the product lessons you shared, just to highlight a few of these things because I think this is great, is just you will often not win if you just make something that's a better copy of something else, what you want to look for is something that is an entirely new experience, something that's differentiated, something that's a lot more compelling. Let's flip to talk about what you've learned from actually being very successful at a lot of things.

(00:12:02):
So I was looking at your resume and you basically have been very successful at every level of the career ladder and in such a huge variety of roles. So let me just read a few of these things for folks that aren't super familiar with your background. You were CTO of Meta, you were co-CEO of Salesforce, you're also CPO and COO at Salesforce. At Google, you joined as an associate product manager where you famously, you didn't mention this but you rebuilt Google Maps on weekend. We're not going to talk about that. You're chairman of the board at OpenAI. You were chairman of the board at Twitter. You've also founded three different companies, one social network, one productivity docs company called Quip, and now, Sierra. Fun fact, at FriendFeed you invented the like button and I don't know if people know that and also just the newsfeed, I'll just throw that out there to give you some credit.

(00:12:50):
So you're basically an associate product manager, an IC product manager, an engineer, CPO, COO, CTO, CEO of three different companies including a public company. Very rare that somebody is successful at all these types of roles and all these levels. So, let me just ask you this question. What mindsets or habits or just ways of working have you worked on building in yourself that you think have most contributed to you being successful in such a variety of roles and levels?

Bret Taylor (00:13:19):
Yeah. It's actually something I am proud of. I like the fact I've worn different hats. It's actually amusing when I meet colleagues that I've known from one of those jobs, they'll often think of me through the lens of that job. And so, I'll go to meet folks from Facebook and they think of me largely as an engineer. I'll meet folks from Google, they think me largely as a product person. At Salesforce, a lot of the folks there interacted with me as like a, lack of a better word, a suit, the boss. And I'm not sure they think of me as an engineer at all, even though I was still probably coding on the weekends for fun. And one of the things that is a principle for me is to have a really flexible view of my own identity. I probably would self-describe as an engineer, but more broadly I think of myself as a builder and I like to build products and I think companies are one of the most effective ways to build products.

(00:14:17):
There's also things like open source, but I think I'm a huge believer in the confluence of technology and capitalism to produce just incredible outcomes for customers. And as a consequence, I think to really build something of significance, I think to be a great founder, you really need to be able to not have such a ossified view of your identity that you can't transform into what the company needs you to be at that point. And every founder you'll talk to, one day, I think selling is a big part of being a founder. You have to sell investors on wanting to invest in your company. You have to sell candidates on wanting to work at your company. You have to sell customers to want to use the product that your customer produces. You have to have good design taste, not just for your product but for your marketing and essentially, soliciting your customers.

(00:15:09):
You have to have good engineering. If you're building a technology company, the technology comes first. It's why this industry is so transformative. I probably credit, and I've told this story before, but I'm very grateful for her, but I probably credit Sheryl Sandberg for really changing the way I approach new jobs. The story, and I might be embellishment a little bit, but I think it's broadly accurate. So I had just become the chief technology officer of Facebook and when I first got the job, it was the flavor of CTO or that relatively small group reporting into me, but contributed almost as a very senior architect on a number of projects. And then at some point, Mark Zuckerberg reorganized the company and split it into a bunch of different groups. I ended up with a very large group, 100 under me and I was essentially running our platform and mobile groups, products, design engineering.

(00:16:10):
So I went from a handful of reports to, I don't know, over 1,000 or something. It was a big group. And it was the largest management job. I had become a manager at Google, but a modest team. And so, I was doing okay but not great. And I had this moment where Sheryl saw me, I think I was editing a presentation for a partner just because the presentation I got didn't meet my quality bar and I was editing it and griping about it. She pulled me into a room and gave me talking to a little bit about holding my team to as high of a standard as I have. If someone wasn't meeting my expectations, what was my plan to manage them out of the company or... Just giving me management one-on-one.

(00:16:57):
And she's a remarkable mentor in the sense she can give you feedback that's very direct and often, a bit uncomfortable, but you know she cares about you. And so it was the type of feedback you listen to. I went home that night and I was stewing on it and not very happy. I was like, you get naturally a little defensive in those moments. Is that really true? Am I really fucking it up or is she overreacting? And then I woke up the next day, I was like, "No, she's right." And I had realized this subconscious limiter that was limiting my success in the job, which is, I was trying to conform the job to the things I thought I liked to do. So, I was spending a lot of my time on some product and technology things that I was passionate about, thinking I'm the boss. I should focus on what I want to focus on instead of thinking about, okay, I'm running the mobile and platform teams at Facebook. What's the most important thing to do today to make our mobile and developer platform successful?

(00:18:03):
And when I reframed the job that way, I did different things. And the thing that was the biggest pleasant surprise to me was I liked it. I thought I liked engineering and product, but in fact, when I changed an organization and it turned out to be more successful, I derived a great deal of joy from seeing that success. Our developer platform had a lot of partners and when there was an issue there and I'd spend time on partnerships and it worked and our platform became healthier, the partner became more successful. I took pride in that success and then I just started being better at my job and I realized that the actual act of engineering or product design or all the things I thought I liked, what I really liked is impact.

(00:18:49):
And so, that conversation led to my waking up every morning, sometimes literally, but certainly, in the broadest sets of the words saying, "What is the most impactful thing I can do today?" And really thinking almost like, if you had an external board of advisors telling you what are the things where if you focus on them, you can maximize the likelihood that what you're trying to achieve will happen? Sometimes, it's recruiting, sometimes, it's product, sometimes, it's engineering, sometimes, it's sales. And I've become much more self-reflective just about what is important to work on. And I have become much more receptive to doing things that I previously would've said aren't my favorite things to do because I derive so much joy from having an impact that I enjoy a lot more things now. And so, I really credit Sheryl, I'm so grateful. And actually, it's interesting, I think a lot about this when I give feedback to people now, just those moments that can change the trajectory of your career. I give her all the credit for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):
There's so many people that share stories of Sheryl Sandberg giving them advice and that changing their life. What a mensch.

Bret Taylor (00:20:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
My biggest takeaway from this, which is this question of what is the most impactful thing I could do today? Such a powerful heuristic just to keep in mind. To your point, you may realize you don't want to be doing sales or hiring, but if that's the most impactful thing and you end up doing it, you may realize I like this and I'm good at this and have thought about-

Bret Taylor (00:20:18):
Can I double click on that though for a second?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:19):
Absolutely.

Bret Taylor (00:20:20):
I think it's really hard. One of the dangers for founders and product managers, but I think particularly for founders is incorrect storytelling. People don't like my product because of X. And if you tell that to yourself and you tell it to your team, all of a sudden, it goes from being an intuition to being a fact. Well, you better hope you're right because if you orient your strategy around fixing a problem and you're wrong, your company's going to fail. So why did you lose a deal? You could talk to the salesperson who is on the account or perhaps maybe a product manager was involved in the conversation. It's very important to have intellectual honesty in those moments because you could say something like, "Oh, they didn't buy it because the platform cost too much." And that's something a salesperson might say.

(00:21:16):
Maybe the real reason is they didn't actually see much value in your platform. So it was communicated to the salesperson as it was too expensive. But in fact, the problem was product differentiation. And you could end up going into a discussion on pricing when in fact, there was a much deeper, much harder problem to solve there. But just like when you break up with someone, you don't say, it's because I don't like you anymore. You say it's not you, it's me. You say all these pleasantries because we're all social animals and you want to be pleasant with the people around you. So literally taking what a customer says or what a user says in a focus group or a usability study is rarely correct. It often is related to what the truth is, but it's very important to get right. And so, I think one of the things I've observed with first time founders in particular is you're often a single issue voter based on your skillset.

(00:22:14):
So if you're a great engineer, the answer to almost every problem in your business is engineering. If you're a product designer, the answer almost to the proverbial redesign, I joke, it's like the dead cap balance of a consumer product like this next redesign will fix all of our problems. I don't know if it's ever, ever worked. And then I met a lot of entrepreneurs who come from a business development background, they're always thinking about partnerships and oh, if we just get this partnership done for this distribution channel, everything's going to change. And I think it's really important when you're a founder to be self-aware that you will naturally, subconsciously pick the thing that is your strength, your superpower as a solution to more problems. And in fact, if you think that's a solution to your problem, it may be right, but you probably by default should question it.

(00:23:03):
If you think the thing that you've been doing your whole career is the way to fix your problem, it's at least 30% likely that you've chosen that because of comfort and familiarity not truth. And so, I think one of the skills I think is, it really goes around to do you have a good co-founder? Do you have a good leadership team? If you're a product manager, you're a partner in engineering, you're a partner in marketing, you really want to have very real conversations to ensure that you're actually working on the actual correct thing. And I think it's easy to say what's the most impactful thing to do today? My guess, if a lot of people try that, they'll lie to themselves more often than not. And it's a very challenging question to answer. The question's interesting. Being able to answer it accurately is actually the hard part.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:50):
This feels like such an important lesson you've learned. Is there an example that comes to mind where you learned this the hard way where you actually ended up-

Bret Taylor (00:23:57):
Oh, yeah. You just want to spend this whole thing on my failures, but I'm fine with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):
You've had too much success.

Bret Taylor (00:24:04):
Frontier was my first company. At our peak we had 12 employees, 12 of the best people I've ever worked with. Started the company with Jim Norris, who's an engineer I've known since Stanford and Paul Buhite and Sanjeev Singh who Paul started Gmail. Sanjeev was the first engineer at Gmail, so we had the Google Maps people and Gmail people. It was a pretty awesome founding team. We made a social network, as you said. We invented a lot of concepts that became popular in the newsfeed. We invented the like button. It was really neat. It was a fun time. We were only really popular in Turkey, Italy and Iran, and at one point, we were blocked in Iran, so we were only popular in Turkey and Italy and Silicon Valley. To this day, actually a lot of folks in Silicon Valley are like, "I love FriendFeed." I'm like, that's awesome.

(00:24:51):
It wasn't really a successful business. We were a follower-oriented social network, not a friendship-oriented social network, which meant a lot of our content was more like X or Twitter than it is Facebook in that respect. And a lot of sharing newspaper articles, interests, scientific communities, things like that. And there was a period when Twitter, which was one of our competitors at the time, that there was a lot more social networks at the time. I am probably screwing this up a little bit. I think Obama, Ashton Kutcher and Oprah Winfrey all went on Twitter in a summer and we just got our ass kicked.

(00:25:31):
And it was a great example of you... I think 11 of those 12 people were engineers and we were just making product and I think it was Biz Stone. If you talk to the Twitter folks, they could give you the history on this, but I think Biz was really focused on getting celebrities and public figures onto Twitter, which is totally obvious. If you have a social service that's oriented towards following people, put some people on there worth following and instead, we were exclusively focused on polishing the product.

(00:26:00):
And we actually, I think at our peak of popularity, we were very confident just, I think it was a time when Twitter had the fail whale and it was down half the time and people couldn't even use it. And our product, we were innovating faster, we had more features, people liked it and we were up 100% of the time and we totally lost for no reason related to product at all. And it was an example of, I think somewhat famously not a lot of great entrepreneurs have come out of Google because Google was so successful, I think it's hard as a product manager to see distribution and product design and even business model when you have AdWords and money's raining from the sky. There wasn't as much scrutiny and I think folks like the PayPal Mafia I think learned a lot more about entrepreneurialism than a typical PM at Google. So, we're just getting punched in the face and learning this the hard way.

(00:26:57):
And so, that was probably the most prominent example of it and I think we probably did have a... I can tell you all the flaws of that product, but I don't think that was the reason why we lost. There's a lot of reasons. I think there was a lot of flaws of the product, but it was a lot of other stuff. And so, I've learned, accumulated these skills over time, but I say the hard part of that question is answering it correctly, is it's hard when you don't have experience in something, than to have intuition in it. So I think if there's probably a structural flaw, it wasn't that... I don't know if I could have figured out how to reach out to Ashton Kutcher [inaudible 00:27:28], it's not he's on my Rolodex. But I probably wasn't soliciting advice from the right people.

(00:27:36):
I think that what's great about the technology industry is there's a lot of advice. Choosing whom you listen to is actually quite difficult, but I think we're somewhat myopic. We're in our own little world, creating this product and we weren't asking people from the outside in to say, what are you seeing that could go wrong? What are you seeing that could go right? What are you seeing in the industry that we're not doing that you think we might want to do? And this is why boards are important. This is why finding the right advisors, the advisors will actually tell you what you not [inaudible 00:28:09] want to hear, but you need to hear. I think that was probably the missing part. I'm not sure I was great at market at the time, but if I had solicited the right advice, I could have learned that that was a shortcoming. And I think that was a deep lesson I took from that. I'm a huge believer in boards and getting good advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:26):
Any heuristics or advice for people to know whose advice to listen to? What do you pay attention to when you're like, okay, ignore this person but listen to this person?

Bret Taylor (00:28:35):
Yeah, that one's tough. It does come down to good judgment and being judge of people's character. One thing that is particularly hard is there's not a strong correlation between the confidence with which someone expresses an opinion and the quality of that opinion. I don't want to say it's inversely correlated, but that's funny, with all the podcasts out now, if there's topics I know a lot about, sometimes the most eloquent, confident statements about things I know a lot about, are the least accurate and it sounds extremely persuasive. And so, it does require very good judgment. One thing is I think, not just asking for advice but asking people, who should I talk to get good advice? And you'll find some common answers there and that's often a really strong signal of good judgment.

(00:29:26):
And then one thing I found is when you ask for advice, don't just ask what to do but why. Be an obnoxious two-year-old kid, why? Why? Why? Why? And really try to understand the framework that someone is using to give you advice. The interesting thing about advice is people are often extrapolating from relatively few experiences. So they will say, never do this or always do that. And it's because they had one experience where something backfired or something could have gone better if they had done it. So it's a useful anecdote, but if you don't ask why and understand they had one experience and here's what happened, it can come across as a rule when in fact, it's [inaudible 00:30:08] data and if you ask advice of three people and they all have very similar interactions, you can create a first principles framework from which that advice emerges. And when you start applying it, you're applying it with a degree of nuance that you couldn't if you're just following a rule. So, I think one is, it does come down to good judgment, I think. I don't know how to teach that.

(00:30:30):
I'm a huge believer in good judgment. It's one of the things I hire for. I just think that's something that probably comes from a mix of self perfection. You really need to hold yourselves accountable as an entrepreneur, as a product manager. If you made a bad decision, spend time reflecting on it, number one. And really, try to understand why and try to always improve your judgment. I think at the end of the day, that is why you are a good entrepreneur, a good product manager. And number two, when you get advice, really understand where it's coming from and why so that you can create your own independent view of where that advice came from and recognize that no one's advice is statistically significant or very rarely is it. If you're getting advice on investing from Warren Buffett, yeah, okay, it's statistically significant, but most advice is like something happened to you once and you have regrets.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:28):
I love that you're like, I don't know if I have a great answer then you just give us an incredible answer to this question. I want to go in a different direction. You mentioned that you describe yourself as an engineer. I know I heard you code to relax still. Let me just ask you this question, something a lot of people in college are thinking about. Do you think it still makes sense to learn to code? Do you think this will significantly change in the next few years?

Bret Taylor (00:31:47):
I do still think studying computer science is a different answer than learning to code, but I would say I still think it's extremely valuable to study computer science. I say that because I think computer science is more than coding. If you understand things like Big O notation or complexity theory or study algorithms and why a randomized algorithm works and why two algorithms with the same Big O complexity, one can then practice perform better than others and why a cache miss matters and just all these little... There's a lot more to coding than writing the code. The reason I think that is I do think the act of creating software is going to transform from typing into a terminal or typing into Visual Studio code to operating a code-generating machine. I think that is the future of creating software. But I think operating a code-generating machine requires systems thinking and I think that computer science, there are other disciplines as well, but computer science is a wonderful major to learn systems thinking and at the end of the day, AI will facilitate creating this software.

(00:33:08):
We may do a lot more in the next few years we can't even imagine, but your job as the operator of that code-generating machine is to make a product or to solve a problem and you really need to have great systems thinking and you're going to be managing this machine that's doing a lot of the tedious work of making the button or connecting to the network. But as you're thinking of the intersection of a technology and a business problem, you're trying to affect a system that will solve that problem at scale for your customers and that systems thinking is always the hardest part of creating products.

(00:33:40):
I'll just give you, it's this cheesy simple example, but I think it's representative. At Facebook, we spent a lot of time designing the newsfeed and if you ever had a really, really good designer and they showed you at the time, a Photoshop mock-up of the newsfeed, it was just all as beautiful. The photos, the family was happy and the photo was a perfect photo and the posts were all perfectly grammatically correct and of a completely normal length and the comments and there was the like... Everything was just perfect. And then you'd implement that design and you'd look at your own newsfeed and it looked like shit because it turns out not everyone's photos were made by a professional photographer. The posts were all these different lengths. The comments were like, you suck and... All that stuff.

(00:34:29):
And then all of a sudden you realize that designing a newsfeed, Photoshop is the easy part. You need to actually design a system that produces both in content and visual design, like a delightful experience given input you don't control. And that's a system, it's sort of a design and it's just, what we did practically, I am sure it's changed a lot since I left in 2012, but we made a system so designers had to show their newsfeed designs with real newsfeed data that was messy rather than anything artificial because I think it forced the process to be more realistic.

(00:35:10):
But I say that because I think that whether AI is writing code or doing the design or doing all these other things, you need to learn how to have a system in your head. You need to understand the basics of what's hard and what's easy and what's possible and what's impossible. And AI can help you do that too, by the way. But I do think that's a really useful skill. I think in general, with the advent of AI agents and AI approaching super intelligence in certain domains, I think the tools with which we do our job will change a lot. I think it's very important to have a very loose attachment to the way we do our jobs and that story that we won't talk about when I rewrote Google Maps, everyone talks about that story and I think it's because of Paul [inaudible 00:35:57] who told it on some podcasts and that's where it made the rounds.

(00:36:01):
I think that's going to end up this vestige of the past, almost like the human calculators at NASA before the computers were invented, like wow, a person was a calculator? Whoa, that's fun. Tell me that story. I think just what I was good at will no longer be useful in the future or certainly not valuable in the future and that's okay. So I think we need to have a really loose view of it, but the idea that you shouldn't study these disciplines, it's like people say, I don't want to study math because I'm not going to use it in my career for X. Well, studying maths is quite important. It teaches you how to think. It teaches you how the world works, physics, math, and I think computer science especially, at least the foundations of it, will continue to be the foundations of how we build software and understanding that when you're interacting particularly with something that's smarter than you, producing code you might not completely understand how you constrain it and how you get it to produce these outcomes. I think it will require a lot of sophistication actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):
That's such a great answer. There's this always sense of this binary, should I learn to code or not? And your point here is learn to understand how engineering works and how systems work and what your code does and how it all interconnects, but the way you actually do the coding at your desk will change significantly. This reminds me of something you mentioned on a podcast recently. This idea that you think there's going to, or there should be a new programming language that is more designed for LLMs versus humans. Can you just talk about that because I think a lot of people aren't thinking about that?

Bret Taylor (00:37:27):
I don't know if it's a language, I would call it a programming system because I think language might be too limited. My reductive version of the past, what 40 years of computers maybe more, is we created the hardware for computers, then we created punch cards, which is the way in the late '70s you would tell a computer what to do or maybe mid to late '70s. Then we invented early operating systems and time-sharing systems from the invention of things like Unix at Bell Labs and Berkeley, you ended up with the C programming language, Fortran and a lot of higher level programming languages. I think Fortran and then C.

(00:38:15):
And we moved up the layers of abstraction. No one does punch cards anymore, obviously. Few people write assembly language. Some people write C, some people write REST. But a lot of people write Python and TypeScript and things like that. And as we've invented more and more abstractions, we've made it easier to do high-leverage things. So, if you look at how remarkable Google was back in the day or Google Maps, you could probably give a lot of react programmers the task of make a draggable map now and I think a lot of people could do it. That was true RND back in the day.

(00:38:54):
When Salesforce was created in 1998, just putting a database in the cloud was hard and that alone was a technical moat that is now trivial with Amazon Web Services and that technical moat is comically narrow, but the product moat is quite large. I think that if the act of writing code is going from something that is very costly to the marginal cost of that going to zero, how many of the abstractions that we've built are based on human program or productivity? I think a ton. I always laugh that I assume Python is probably the most common generated code just because of how much it's in the training data and data scientists love Python and I love Python too. It's such a comically bad thing for AI to generate just because it's one of the most inefficient programming languages of all time. If you know the global interpreter lock and just slow. And I've written a lot of high-scale web services and it's just quite slow and it's very hard to verify.

(00:40:00):
It's not as bad as Perl, but if you have a big Python program, how many errors will you find at runtime versus before releasing it? So, Python was designed to be very ergonomic, almost looked like pseudo code for humans, for me to write code in a delightful way. That's why data scientists love it so much. So as we move to a world where let's just postulate, and I'm not sure this will be completely true, that we're not going to write a lot of code as people. We're going to be operating these code-generating machines. We probably don't care how ergonomic the programming language is. What we care about is when this machine generates code, do we know that it did what we wanted it to do? And if it doesn't do we want it to do, can we change it easily? I think there's a lot of insights in programming languages that could serve this.

(00:40:48):
So Rust I think, is interesting because if I asked you to look at a C program and say, "Does it leak memory?" You probably couldn't do it that well just because it's really hard and if it's a very, a million line C program, it's going to be very, very hard. If I asked you to verify that a Rust program doesn't leak memory, you would just have to compile it. And because it has compile time, memory safety, just the act of compiling successfully tells you that's true. I think we need more things like that because if an AI is generating this code, by definition, if you have to read every line that is going to be the limiting factor for producing the code or worse, you're just not going to read every line and you're going to emit a bunch of unsafe unverified code into the wild.

(00:41:36):
And so, the question is how do you enable humans to have as much leverage as possible? Which means using computers to do the work on your behalf. You could have obviously the simplest form of this, is AI supervising AI and doing code reviews and that's great. Certainly, self-reflection is a really effective way of improving the robustness of an AI system. But I do think if it doesn't matter how tedious it is to write the code, you could probably layer on some techniques that are out of fashion, like formal verification, unit testing, other things. And if you layer all these on, I'm thinking about it as, I as a... It's like the guy in the matrix with the green letters coming down, how can I make something so I as a operator of the code generating machine can produce incredibly complex scale software, incredibly quickly and know that it works?

(00:42:26):
If you start with that as your design center, I think you'd probably changed the languages, you'd probably changed the systems, you'd probably change all these things and you're probably going to bring to bear a lot of things. And what's really fun about it is you can loosen a lot of constraints, like coding is free. Okay, so that's neat. With that in mind, what do you want to do? What would be best suited for the language, the compiler for testing, for self-reflection, for supervisor models, all these things. I think that's more of a programming system than a language, but I think when we create something like that, it can really enable creators, builders to create incredibly robust, incredibly complex systems.

(00:43:04):
And I'm super excited about VibeCoding, but I don't know generating a prototype has been the limiting factor in software ever. It's actually building increasingly complex systems and actually changing them with agility. If you look at the famous Netscape one to Netscape two rewrite, somewhat, a lot of people attribute that to part of their failure against Internet Explorer. It's like making these things is not hard. Maintaining them is hard and ensuring they're robust is hard. And I think we're in the very early phases of defining what this new system for developing software looks like and I'm very excited to see what emerges.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:42):
I feel like we're definitely living in the future when someone like you is suggesting that we build a matrix like experience and that's going to be potentially the future of coding and building. I can't wait for that. It feels like a great opportunity and a fun project.

(00:43:57):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta and I'm very excited to have Christina Cacioppo CEO and co-founder Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:06):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):
Vanta is a long time sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:16):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018 focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 2701. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies including some start-up household names like Atlassian Ramp and LangChain, start and scale their security programs and ultimately, build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:54):
That is very much our experience, but before the company and to some extent, during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
We appreciate you for doing that. And you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny. That's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:45:25):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):
Okay. One more question along these lines and then I want to zoom out on just where AI is heading and something I love to ask folks like you that are at the cutting edge of AI is what you're teaching your kids. I know you have kids, I feel like the world is going to be very different when they grow up. What are you encouraging them to learn that you think is different maybe from previous generations to help them be successful in a world of AI abundance?

Bret Taylor (00:45:53):
I don't know if I'm teaching them differently, but I'm really trying to encourage them to make AI a part of their lives. I was reflecting actually when I took the AP calculus exams in '97, '98 AB and BC, I could use a graphing calculator. And I haven't done this research I was meaning to plug this into ChatGPT before our conversation, but I'll do it after. Did the calculus exam change before and after they allowed the calculator in the exam? I assume it did. But essentially, to when you allow the calculator in the exam, you need to make sure that none of the questions benefit people for having a calculator or not, which actually forces you to rethink the problems to test calculus knowledge that don't benefit from like road arithmetic or the other things you can do on a graphing calculator.

(00:46:47):
I think that a lot of education doesn't presume you have a super intelligence in your pocket. And so, if you ask someone to write an essay on a book that they read, you could probably hallucinate one pretty easily from one of the big providers like ChatGPT. And maybe if you are skilled enough that prompting, maybe even your teacher won't know it's written by an AI. So what do you do? How do you teach kids differently? It's really hard for teachers right now because I think we haven't gone through the transition of adding calculators to the exams. So, I think a lot of the mechanisms we have to evaluate students are broken by the existence of ChatGPT and the like. So I think we're in a very awkward phase, but I think we can still both teach kids how to think and teach kids how to learn. And I think our education system can catch up and I actually think these models can be one of the most effective educational tools in history.

(00:47:46):
I don't know if you're a visual learner or reading learner. I like to read. I didn't love going to lectures. I don't learn that well from them. I like to read the book and if you have a teacher who doesn't teach in your style, you can now go home and ask ChatGPT to teach you in another mechanism. My kids use ChatGPT to quiz them before a test. You can use audio mode or chat mode. It's better than cue cards. My daughter took home a Shakespeare book, she took a picture of a page she didn't understand and ChatGPT explained it to her way better than I would've as well. I think every child in this world has a personalized tutor that can teach them in the way that they best learn, visually, over audio, reading. We have a platform that can test you, that can quiz you. I think it's really an amplifier of agency.

(00:48:39):
I think the kids who have agency, who have aspirations to learn something, I think you have what is the best combination of every teacher you've ever had and these models and you can use it. So with my kids, my oldest daughter learned how to code and she was making a website and every time she had a question for me, I would just make her use ChatGPT. Not because I was trying to be an obnoxious father, but I'm like she needs to learn to use this tool because it's amazing.

(00:49:13):
So, I really am trying to have them learn how to use it constructively in their lives. But all that said, I just feel a ton of empathy for public school teachers right now. It's very hard because the technology is moving faster than our educational system. And I think particularly as it relates to evaluation, it's just really challenging for teachers right now. And I worry because these technologies amplify agency, the opposite can also be true. If you are a student trying to not learn something, I think these tools probably provide a lot of mechanisms to avoid it as well. And so, I think there's a challenge for parents and teachers and I think we're going to end up with a handful of years here.

(00:49:53):
But I brought up the calculus AP exam because obviously, a graphing calculator is not ChatGPT, don't get me wrong. But I think we've been able to figure out a way to conform homework and in-class learning and tests around the technologies available to us fairly successfully to date. And I'm fairly confident we'll figure it out and I think it's going to... And on the much more positive side, I don't know, I went to public schools, I don't know if you did too. You end up with some pretty bad teachers at times and now, you have an outlet. You don't need to be the rich kid who can afford a tutor anymore to get tutoring. If you are a kid who excels in math and your school doesn't have advanced statistics classes, well, now you do.

(00:50:40):
So I think this is just an incredibly democratizing force with kids who have agency and I think that's very exciting. I'm hopeful that there's a 11-year-old right now who's going to start a really amazing company 10 years from now whose ChatGPT is going to be their primary tutor that led to that outcome. And I think that's pretty cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:02):
I have a two-year-old and it feels like there's a new milestone of, there's like when to give them a phone, when to give them, I don't know, Snapchat, whatever kids use these days and then it's like when to give them their first ChatGPT account. Well no, I wonder how soon that's supposed to happen.

Bret Taylor (00:51:16):
I think my personal take is, it's different than the former two. I don't think mobile phones are great in school or great for kids and I personally advocate for waiting a long time. But I think that ChatGPT is more like Google search and it's one thing to have a device in your pocket that's addictive and has push notifications, but it's another thing to use AI to learn. And so, I think the two are different. And I really think of AI fundamentally as a utility. I don't think a lot of parents before ChatGPT said, "When should I let my kid use Google search?" That's a different type of tool. I think thinking of it like that is the way I think about these technologies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):
Is the form factor for your kids like an iPad or a laptop or something?

Bret Taylor (00:51:58):
Yeah. They use the computer on the desk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:01):
Got it. All right. Good tips. This is good for me to learn all these things as my kid ages. Okay, I'm going to zoom out and let's talk about business strategy AI. One of the biggest questions a lot of founders think about these days is just where should I build? What will foundational model companies not squash and do themselves? Being someone building a very successful AI business and also being on the board of OpenAI, feel like you have a really unique perspective on what is probably a good idea and it's probably not a good idea. How do you think the AI market is going to play out and where do you think founders should focus and also just try to avoid?

Bret Taylor (00:52:36):
I think there's three segments of the AI market that will end up fairly meaningful markets and then I'll end with how I think it's going to play out. So first is the frontier model market or foundation model market. I think this will end up the small handful of hyperscalers and really big labs just like the cloud infrastructure as a service market. And the reason for that is that creating a frontier model is entirely a function of CapEx. And you need a company with huge amounts of CapEx capacity to build one of these models. All of the companies that were startups that tried to do this have already been consolidated or almost all of them, inflection, adapt, character and others. And I think there doesn't appear to be a viable business model for a startup because of the amount of CapEx required and there's just not enough fundraising runway to get to escape velocity. And also, the models deteriorate in value fairly quickly as an asset class.

(00:53:33):
And so, you need just a lot of scale to make a return on the investment for a model that deteriorates in value so quickly. So, I think that's going to end up probably no entrepreneur should build a frontier model. That's my take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):
Unless you're Elon.

Bret Taylor (00:53:51):
Yeah. Oh, yeah. He's different. And he has the capacity to raise billions in capital and my guess is most of your other listeners don't, and then he is the greatest of all time for reason and he's different. You don't compare yourself to him. The other part of the market is the tooling, and I think there's a lot of folks selling pickaxes in the Gold Rush. This is data labeling, services. This is data platforms, it's eval tools. More specialized models like 11 Labs has a great set of voice models that a lot of companies use that are really high quality and it's like if you're trying to be successful in AI, what are the different tools and services that you need?

(00:54:31):
There is some risk to the tooling market because it's pretty close to the sun. So, if you look at the infrastructure as a service market and the cloud tooling market like the Confluent and Databricks and Snowflake, a lot of the Amazon and Azure and others have competing products in those areas because they're very adjacent to the infrastructure itself and every infrastructure provider is trying to differentiate by moving up the stack and you're right there.

(00:54:57):
So, there's some real meaningful companies as I mentioned, like Snowflake, Databricks, Confluent and others, but there's a lot of others that were obviated by technology from the infrastructure providers themselves. So those companies probably are the most at risk for a developer day from one of these big foundation model companies releasing exactly what they do. So there's probably a lot of people who need your tool, but the question will be if or when is probably the right way to think about it, one of these large infrastructure providers introduces a competitor, why will people continue to choose you? So it's a good market but it's a little bit close to the end as I said.

(00:55:38):
Then there's the applied AI market. I think this will play out for companies who build agents. I think agent is the new app. I think that's going to be the product form factor. There's companies like Sierra, we help companies build agents to answer the phone or answer the chat for customer experience and customer service. There's companies like Harvey that make agents for both a legal, paralegal profession, anti-trust reviews, reviewing contracts etc, etc. There's companies that do content marketing. There's companies that do supply chain analysis. I think this is like the software as a service market. They'll probably be higher margin companies because you're selling something that achieves a business outcome as opposed to being a byproduct of the models themselves. They will almost certainly pay taxes down to the model providers, which is why those model providers will end up extremely large scale but probably slightly lower margin and I think the market for them will be probably less technical.

(00:56:37):
If you think about the purest form of software as a service, it's not like you ask what database do you use? It's really about the feature and function. I think that's where agents will go. I think it's going to be more about product than it is about technology over time. Just going back to my metaphor, in 1998 when Mark and Parker started Salesforce, just getting that database running in the cloud was like a technical achievement. Nowadays, no one asks about that because you can just spin up a database in AWS or Azure and it's like no problem. I think today, orchestrating an agentic process on top of the models, sounds really fancy and it's really hard and all that stuff. I'm pretty sure that's going to be easy in three or four years. It's just like just as the technology improves. And so, over time you say, what is an agent company? Well, it looks a little bit like [inaudible 00:57:30] as a service.

(00:57:30):
You talk a little bit less about how you deal with the models in the same way modern SaaS, few people ask what database you use, but you'll probably ask a lot about the workflows and what business outcomes that you're driving. Are you generating leads for a sales team? Are you minimizing your procurement spend? Whatever value you're providing, it's going to slowly evolve towards that.

(00:57:53):
I'm very excited. I don't think startups should probably build foundation models. But you can shoot your shot if you have a vision for the future, go for it. But I think it's probably a challenging market that's already consolidated. I'm very excited about the other two markets. I'm particularly excited as building agents becomes easier, to see a lot of long tail agent companies come out. I was looking at a website for the top 50 software companies in the stock market and obviously, the top five are the big, big boom ones like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, all that, but the next 50 are all SaaS companies and some of them are very exciting, some of them are super boring, but this is how the software market has evolved and I think we're going to see something similar with agents.

(00:58:38):
It's not just going to be these huge markets like we're in customer service and software engineering. It's going to be a lot of things where people are spending a lot of time and resources that an agent can just solve, but it requires an entrepreneur who actually understands that business problem, and deeply, and I think that's where a lot of the value is going to be unlocked in the AI market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:00):
That is incredibly helpful. This makes me think about, I had Marc Benioff on the podcast, you guys were co-CEOs and he was extremely agent-pilled. All he wanted to talk about was Agentforce. Clearly you're also very agent-pilled. What is it that-

Bret Taylor (00:59:14):
I've never heard the term agent-pilled [inaudible 00:59:18].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:18):
Clearly you guys saw something that was just like, okay, we need to go all in on agents. This is the future. What is it you think people are missing about just why this is such a critical change in the way software is going to work? What are people not seeing?

Bret Taylor (00:59:31):
If you talk to an economist like Larry Summers who, on the OpenAI board with me, they'll talk about what is the value of technology? Will it help strive productivity in the economy. And if you look at one of the big jumps in productivity in the economy was in the '90s, and I think a lot of folks I talked to think it was actually that very first wave of computing where people made ERP systems and just put accounting into computers and databases, even mainframes, we're talking like the PC era. Because it was such a huge step-up, just imagine the ledgers of numbers that you'd have for a large multinational company before and it truly just transformed departments.

(01:00:14):
I'll give you a little toy example. My dad just retired. He was a mechanical engineer and he was talking about when he first started his career in the late '70s and he went into a mechanical engineering firm, the majority of the firm were drafts people. So basically, you take an engineering design but you needed to do all the different vantage points and for all the different floors and to give to the contractor to do the thing. Now, there are zero drafts people at his company. You just make the design in first AutoCAD and now Revit and it's a 3D model and the drafting has actually been eliminated. It's just not a thing one needs to do anymore. The actual design and drafting, drafting is not a thing that exists. It's just a design. That's true productivity gains, right? It's like the job of the mechanical engineering firm was to do a design. The drafting was this necessary output for the contractor, but it wasn't really adding value. It was just like the supply chain change.

(01:01:12):
If you look at the history of the software industry from the PC on, there's been meaningful productivity gains but just not nearly as meaningful as that first huge jump. And I'm not smart enough to know exactly why, but it is interesting, the promise of productivity gains from technology hasn't been as realized I think as some people thought. I think agents will truly start to bend the curve again like we did in the very early days of computing because software is going from helping an individual be slightly more productive to actually accomplishing a job autonomously. And as a consequence, just like you don't need drafts people in a mechanical engineering firm, you just won't need someone doing that thing anymore. It means they can do something else that's higher leverage and more productive and you can actually... A smaller group of people can accomplish more and truly drive productivity gains in the economy.

(01:02:15):
And I think if you've ever sold enterprise software, you end up in these discussions as a vendor with the customer where you'll have a value discussion and you'll do these somewhat convoluted things like okay, it's like you're selling a sales thing. Okay, well, if every salesperson sells 5% more... And you should pay us a million dollars. And it's roughly that conversation and it's so unattributable especially... And it's why it's so hard to sell productivity software, which I learned the hard way, it's just hard to know what's the value of making everyone 10% more productive? Did you actually make them 10% more productive or did something else change? You don't really know all these things. But now with an agent actually accomplishing a job, not only is it actually truly driving productivity in a very real way, but it's measurable as well.

(01:03:10):
So all those things combined means I think this is actually a step change in how we think about software because it does a job autonomously, which is more self-evident, a productivity driver. It's measurable so people value it differently as well, which is why I also believe in outcomes-based pricing for software.

(01:03:32):
And all of that combined to me, it feels like as significant as the cloud or I think more technologically, but just in terms of how it transforms the business model of the software industry where there's going to be a before and after. I don't know how many people still sell perpetually licensed on premises software, but it's de minimis at this point. I think we're going to go through a similar transition. The whole market is going to go towards agents. I think the whole market is going to go towards outcomes-based pricing, not because it's the only way, but the market is going to pull everyone there because it's just so obviously the correct way to build and sell software.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):
Let me pull on that last thread. So we had Madhavan on the podcast recently, pricing expert, legend, monetizing innovation author and he talked about pricing strategy for AI companies and he was very much in your camp of, if you can, you need to price your product as an outcome-based product and the access uses exactly what you shared, which is, you can do that if you can attribute the impact and it's autonomous, it's running on its own. And he actually used Sierra as one of the shining examples of this being successful. Can you just briefly just explain a little bit what is outcome-based pricing for people that haven't heard this term before and then just how does it work for Sierra to give an example?

Bret Taylor (01:04:45):
Yeah, I'll start with the example and then I'll broaden it. So at Sierra, we help companies make customer facing AI agents primarily for customer service, but more broadly, for customer experience. So if you have a problem with your [inaudible 01:04:58], you'll call or chat with Harmony, who's their AI agent. If you have ADT home security and your alarm doesn't work, you can chat with their AI agent. Sonos speakers, a lot of different consumer brands. And if you think about running a call center, there's a cost for every phone call that you take. Most of it is labor costs, but if you have, let's just say a typical phone call is anywhere between 10 and $20 USD. Some of it's software, some of it's telephony, but a lot of it is just like the hourly wage of the person answering the phone.

(01:05:32):
So if an AI agent can take that call and solve it, that is in the industry often called a call deflection or a containment. And that essentially means you saved, call it $15 because you didn't have to have someone pick up the phone. So in our industry, basically we say, "Hey, if the AI agent solves the customer's problem, they're happy with it and you didn't have to pick up the phone," there's a pre-negotiated rate for that and we call it resolution based. There are other outcomes as well. We have some sales agents being paid a sales commission, believe it or not. We do. We really think of our agents as truly customer experience like the concierge for your brand and we want to make sure that our business model is aligned with our customer's business model.

(01:06:22):
As you said, these agents need to be autonomous and the outcome has to be measurable. That's not always possible, but I think it's broadly possible. And what's really neat about it is if you talk to any CFO or head of procurement with their big vendors, they look at the bill of materials and it's overwhelming and it's impossible to know if you're getting the value that you hoped from that contract. I think consumption based, which was popular particularly in the infrastructure space is closer to it. But I'm not sure a token is actually a good measure of value from AI either. I always use the analogy, like right now, most of the coding agents are priced per token or per utilization, but there's this famous story of an Apple engineer who had a bad manager who's like had you report how many lines of code you wrote every day? Which every engineer in the world knows is an idiotic way to measure productivity.

(01:07:16):
He famously went in with a report that had a negative number because I think he did a big refactoring, deleted a bunch and it was his way of saying like, fuck you to the man. I think tokens are similar. Yeah, you used a lot of tokens, like good for you, did it produce a pull request that was good? And I think that's the whole point of all this. I think there's a huge difference between outcomes-based pricing and usage based pricing because especially in AI, they're not necessarily even correlated and you could have a long phone call and not solve the customer's problem and they give you a negative review online and call the call center again, all that effort was for nothing. In fact, you might've added negative value. And so, I am a huge believer in this.

(01:07:58):
And what's fun about it is it really just aligns... I think every technology company aspires to be a partner, not a vendor. And I think at Sierra, we are truly a partner to every single one of our customers because we're all aligned on what we want to achieve. And I think that is really where the software industry should go. It requires a lot of different shape of a company. You have to be able to help your customers achieve those outcomes. You can't just throw software at the wall because you'll never get paid if it doesn't. Your orientation becomes so extremely customer-centric when you do this the right way. I think it's just a better version of the software industry. So I think it's right from first principles, it's right for procurement partners and I think it's right for the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:43):
We've been chatting a little bit about productivity gains. There's a lot of skepticism in the headlines these days of just like what is AI actually doing? Is it actually helping people be more productive? There was a recent study actually, I don't know if you saw, where they showed engineers were less productive with AI because it was just putting them in different directions. They had to research all what's going wrong here? So I think CX is a really good example where you clearly are seeing gains. Are you seeing actual gains at your company or any other company you work with outside of CX in terms of productivity that is like clearly yes, this is working and a huge deal?

Bret Taylor (01:09:15):
I'm extremely bullish on the productivity gains from AI, but I do think the tools and products right now are somewhat immature and it's quite counterintuitive. So, for example, almost every software engineering firm I know uses something like Cursor to help their software engineers. Most people use Cursor right now as a coding autocomplete, though they have a lot of agentic solutions and there's a lot of... OpenAI has Codex and Cloud has... I can't remember the Anthropic products. So there's lots of agentic agents coming as well. One of the interesting things because the technology is immature, the code it produces often has problems. There's a lot of people approaching this to actually realize those productivity gains because as any engineer who's written a lot of code will tell you, it's pretty easy to look at and edit and fix code you wrote.

(01:10:10):
Reviewing other people's code or particularly finding a subtle logical error in someone else's code is actually really hard. It's actually much harder than editing code that you wrote yourself. So if the code produced by a coding agent is often incorrect, it actually can take a lot of cognitive load and time to fix it. And in fact, if you end up producing lots of issues with your customers, you could end up producing a lot of features, but actually, is like mucking up the machine a little bit and having something that's not ideal. There's a couple of techniques that I think are interesting. First, I think there's a lot of AI starts now working on things like code reviews. I think this idea of self-reflection in agents is really important. Having AI supervise the AI is actually very effective. Just think about it this way, if you produce an AI agent that's right 90% of the time, that's not that great, but how hard would it be to make another AI agent to find the errors the other 10% of the time? That might be a tractable problem.

(01:11:10):
And if that thing's right 90% of the time, just for argument's sake, you can wire those things together and have something that's right 99% of the time. So it's just a math problem and it turns out that you can make something to generate code, you can make something to review code and you're essentially using compute for cognitive capacity and you can layer on more layers of cognition and thinking and reasoning and produce things increasingly robust. So I'm very excited about that. The other thing though is root cause analysis. So we have an engineer at Sierra who exclusively focuses on the model context protocol server serving our cursor instance. And our whole philosophy is, if cursor generated something incorrect, rather than just fixing it, try to root cause it. Try to get it so the next time Cursor will produce the correct code and essentially, is context engineering.

(01:12:05):
What context did Cursor not have that would've been necessary to produce the right outcome? So I think people who are trying to get productivity gains in departments like software engineering need to stop waiting for the models to magically work if they want to see the gains now. And you really have to create root cause analysis and systems and say, how do we go root cause every bad line of code and actually give the right context and produce the right system so the models can do it today? Over time that'll probably be less necessary and you'll have less context engineering necessary to do it, but you really have to think of this as a system and I think people are waiting for the models to just magically get better. And I'm like, well that will happen eventually, but if you want the gains now you got to put in the work. That's essentially why applied AI companies exist.

(01:12:53):
And the work is non-trivial, but you can do it. And so, for customers using platforms like Sierra, yeah, AI agents aren't perfect, but we're creating a system that lets customers create a virtuous cycle of improvement. If you want to go from a 65% automated resolution rate to 75%, we have a billion tools to let AI help you do that, identify opportunities for improvement, figure out why people are frustrated, what new capabilities can we add to our agent to improve the resolution rate? And you let AI put the needles at the top of the haystack on your behalf and I think that's really the way to optimize these systems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):
I've never heard of this technique of improving Cursor by adding additional context. What's the actual way of doing that? You build an MCP server that everything runs through or is it like you add Cursor rules? What's the actual approach there?

Bret Taylor (01:13:41):
I'm probably out of my depth here, but it's essentially MCP because that's how you provide context to Cursor. And I think that almost always when you have a model making a poor decision, if it's a good model, it's lack of context. And so, you really want to find the intersection of your particular product and code base with the context available to these coding agents and systems and fix it at the root is the principle here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:06):
Got it. That is very cool. I hadn't heard of people doing that, model context protocol, makes sense. We've talked about productivity gains outside TX. Just to give you a chance to share how amazing what you've built is, what are some of the gains you see from people using Sierra?

Bret Taylor (01:14:18):
Yeah, our customers see anywhere between 50 and 90% of their customer service interactions completely automated, which I think is really exciting. And we serve just a really, really broad range of customers. We serve the health insurance industry, the healthcare provider space, banks. You can actually refinance your home using an agent. One of our customers built on our platform to the telecommunications industry, DIRECTV, SiriusXM to a lot of retailers as well, which is really fun. Everyone from Wayfair to clothing retailers like OluKai and Chubbies Shorts. What's really neat about it is it's a pretty diverse range of use cases and it's everything from helping you sign up for... We have an agent that helps with customer support in one of the big dating applications to helping you upgrade or downgrade your SiriusXM plan. Actually, it's really funny, we do technical support from everything from home alarm systems to sonar speakers to more recently, CAT scan machines, which I think is amazing.

(01:15:28):
So technicians going in and fixing the CAT scan machine can chat with an AI agent to help them guide them through that process. We're the leader in the space, we're trying to enable every company in the world to create their agent with their brand at the top that I think will become as meaningful of a digital touch point as their website or their mobile app. In the short term, it can really transform the costs of running a customer service team. And what's remarkable is do so with really high customer satisfaction scores. That Weight Watchers agent, I believe has a customer satisfaction score of 4.6 out of five, which is pretty amazing. And what's interesting about service too, it's often people having a problem. And so, when you have a clear, I don't know if you use them in the airport, I think that agent has a CSAT score of 4.7 out of five people are coming in with a problem and [inaudible 01:16:19] delighted. And I think that's really the opportunity here.

(01:16:22):
And our whole vision is that we're going to move towards a world where every single one of the interactions with your customers can be instant. It can be multilingual, it can be over audio, it can be over chat, it can be digital, it can be over the phone and it can be very personalized. And I think that's really, really exciting. And if you think about all the best moments you've had with a brand, it's like that store associate who you know, and it's like for me, it's like the butcher at the grocery store. I love to cook, he knows me. We talk. Can you actually produce that at scale for a company with 100 million customers and can you do it in a really personal way? And I think we're really on the cusp of enabling that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):
Let me ask you one more question before we get to a very exciting lighting round. There's a lot of founders struggling with go-to-market in AI with their AI apps. There's so many apps these days, so many products, so many things coming at buyers, at large B2B companies. Clearly you guys have figured something out. I imagine your name helps, investors help, but what have you learned about just how to successfully do go-to-market with an AI product, say an agent-specific product that you think would be helpful for folks trying to do this better?

Bret Taylor (01:17:35):
I think there's a small handful of go-to-market models that have been proven to work, and I think it's important to choose the right one for the product category you're going after. One category I would say is developer-led. This is somewhere famously Stripe and Twilio where probably two of the original that did this exceptionally. And essentially, the go-to-market motion there is to appeal to an individual engineer often within the department of the CTO who have accountability and a fair amount of latitude to choose a solution. This works if your product is a platform product. It doesn't work, for example, if your product is trying to help a line of business because lines of business typically don't have dedicated engineering teams or let alone, the latitude to just go download a new library or start using a web service like that. It particularly works well if you sell to startups just because startups tend to have engineering teams with quite a bit of latitude to choose services to help them solve the problem given by the founder.

(01:18:44):
Then there's product-led growth. It's a broad term, obviously every company's product matters, but product-led growth more specifically means users can sign up from the website, often get put on a trial. Often you can buy a couple of seats with a credit card and those work where your user and your buyer are the same person. So it works for small business software almost always because sole proprietors do everything. And so you're selling small business software like Shopify in the early days and there's a lot of other products like that where you're trying to sell to small merchants. That's great. It doesn't work well when your buyer and the user of the software are different. So I'll use the example of something like expense reporting software. The user of that software is an individual employee, but the buyer is often a finance department. And so having sign up and buy with your credit card doesn't make sense because the person using is not the person with the credit card and it just doesn't work.

(01:19:39):
And then there's direct sales. And direct sales had gone, I don't want to say out of fashion, but if I think of the best direct sales companies, probably there's a lot of lineage from Oracle, but you think SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Adobe perhaps, and there's others as well. And these were companies that sold into large lines of business in a relatively traditional sales motion. I think because product-led growth became very popular. I think a lot companies use that, which is great, that motion produces great products, but if PLG means that you aren't actually engaging with the buyer of your software, you're not going to grow. And so, I've actually seen more recently, with a lot of AI companies, direct sales come a little bit more back into fashion because I think so many of the opportunities in AI actually meet that qualification where the buyer and the user are not necessarily the same person and it really requires that go-to-market motion.

(01:20:40):
Where I see entrepreneurs stumble is they'll choose a go-to-market motion without thinking through what is the process of purchasing this software? What is the process of evaluating the value of this software? And I think people just need to be much more first principles about it and much more thoughtful about it. And candidly, I think a lot of companies should leverage direct sales more than they do. And even though because of the sometimes justified reputation of the quality of products of some of these direct sales companies, it had gotten a bad name. And I think I'm thankful to see it coming back in a lot of the AI market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):
I feel like this message is something a lot of founders need to hear, especially founders that aren't from a business background that sales turns them off, they don't think they're going to be great at sales. Just this push of this might be what you have to get really good at and this is how you win and you can't just rely on product like growth.

Bret Taylor (01:21:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:38):
Bret, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any last nugget of wisdom? Anything you want to double click on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Bret Taylor (01:21:47):
No, go ahead.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:48):
Okay, let's do it. Here we go. Welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Bret Taylor (01:21:53):
Yeah, go ahead.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:54):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Bret Taylor (01:21:59):
I don't read a lot of nonfiction, but probably if I had to pick one in the area of the topics we talked about, Competing Against Luck, which was the book that produced Jobs to be Done, which is a framework I really believe in. My only critique is I think most of these business books should be like an article. So maybe buy the book and punch it into ChatGPT and get the summary. But buy the book it's Clayton Christensen talked about it, but it's a really good framework for thinking about delivering value with your products. And I think it definitely influenced me.

(01:22:37):
Actually one book I do recommend is Endurance, which is the story of Shackleton's trip to go to the South Pole. Half the book is him starving to death and eating seal meat with his crew of people frozen in their boat. I've never seen a better story of grit in my entire life. It's remarkable that it's a true story and if you're an entrepreneur going through a hard time, read that, you'd be like, okay, it could be worse. It's a great book too. It's just remarkable that it's a true story.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:08):
And one thing he did a great job at is setting expectations for folks that joined that famous newspaper-

Bret Taylor (01:23:13):
That ad. That newspaper ad. I don't know if that's true. It's remarkable if that's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):
Oh, it might not be true.

Bret Taylor (01:23:17):
I don't know. The internet. Who knows?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:20):
Goddam. Deep fakes even back then. Okay. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Bret Taylor (01:23:27):
I haven't gone to any new TV shows recently? We just watched Inception with the kids and they loved it and made me appreciate Christopher Nolan and what a cool movie. It's the type of movie when you watch the film and you can a conversations for two days afterwards about it. So, just a great film.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):
I saw someone using I think VO 3 to create their own Inception videos where the worlds wrapping in on each other. Oh, man. Okay. Do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you love or one you've loved for a long time?

Bret Taylor (01:23:59):
I'm really a big fan of Cursor. I think it's changed. I love creating software and I'm excited though for agents. I've been really excited. I was very excited to see Codex from OpenAI and others. So I think Cursor will be in its current form, is a transition product. And I know they're working on agents as well, but I really enjoyed taking something I love and it's been my life's passion and really diving into this AI tool and seeing how it transforms how I create software. So I've just been spending a lot of time with the product just because it's so core to what I love to do and it's a really well crafted product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:39):
I think that's the first time someone's actually mentioned Cursor in this answer, so might be the beginning of a trend. Michael Trell was on the podcast and he actually had a very similar message as you had at the beginning of this chat about the future of code, what comes after code and this concept that there's going to be this additional pseudo code layer on top of code. Very aligned with your thinking. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Bret Taylor (01:25:05):
The best way to predict the future is to invent it, which I think I attribute to Alan Kay of Xerox PARC. He invented a lot of the core abstractions that we use in computing today. I'm an entrepreneur, it's why I love to build things and it's definitely a life motto for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:29):
I feel like many people say this, I feel like you've actually done this so many times. You're really living this motto. Final question. We talked about you inventing the like button at FriendFeed. Were there other thoughts of what they would call it other than like? Was it just obviously like? Or was there other thinking there?

Bret Taylor (01:25:48):
This was before emoji. So, if you read the comments on FriendFeed posts, at least 70% of them are cool or wow or yeah or neat. And one of the principle uses of FriendFeed was to have discussions about things. So you'd have a post and then a pretty fulsome discussion underneath. And compared to Twitter and others, it was a great place to have those discussions. And so, the product problem we were trying to solve is get all the one word answers out so that the discussion was actually actual comments as opposed to acknowledgements that you read the thing.

(01:26:30):
So, the original framing was one click comment. That was how we thought about it. And so, the first version that I made had a heart, and she denies remembering this, but Anna Yang, now Anna Muller who has worked at the company, she hated it. She said, "If I look at hearts on every post, I'm going to vomit. It's too much." And it also was interesting, we were simulating, it was like an article about a tragedy or something. A heart was just not the right thing. Like which actually turned out to be really hard to translate was just a much more neutral sentiment, and that's why it was hard to translate because it was subtle. So that's how we ended up with this.

(01:27:17):
We started with a heart, and I don't know if we ever heard the word love, but we definitely started off with the iconography and then like, which just felt like this positive yet as neutral as possible within the realm of positive so that it could work for a more complex story. But it was all because we needed a one-click comment. That's where the concept came from.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
Wow. I've never heard the story before. It makes me think about LinkedIn now. They're basically trying to solve that same problem. They have all these auto-reply pill tag things. I don't think people like those very much.

Bret Taylor (01:27:37):
Yeah. They have a lot of features.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):
So many AI features. Bret, this was incredible. This was an honor. I so appreciate you coming on this podcast. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe go see if they want to work at Sierra and how can listeners be useful to you?

Bret Taylor (01:28:00):
If you want an AI agent to help with customer service, go to sierra.ai. If you want to apply here, sierra.ai/careers where we have offices in San Francisco and New York, Atlanta and London and are hiring pretty aggressively in every department. So please reach out if you're interested.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):
And how can listeners be useful to you? Is it tryout Sierra, anything else there?

Bret Taylor (01:28:21):
Yeah, tryout Sierra. I'm a single issue voter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:26):
[inaudible 01:28:26] message. I love it.

Bret Taylor (01:28:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:27):

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Everyone's always complaining SEO's dead, it can't grow. Word of mouth is so hard. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:03):
All of the ingredients for new distribution platform are essentially happening. My prediction, the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT. There's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
This is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:16):
It ends up being a prisoner's dilemma. Don't trick yourself into thinking that you can't play the game. The cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time. If you don't do it, your competitors are going to go to the new platform and your customer expectations change. There is no opting out of the game. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
This is the opportunity to disrupt an incumbent. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:33):
If you're a late-stage company, you place multiple bets. For startups, it's a totally different ballgame. You have to choose one and go all in. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Think about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies.

Brian Balfour (00:00:43):
Building a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient. And actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
What would be the backup if not ChatGPT? 

Brian Balfour (00:00:54):
My hypothesis of who's best-positioned would actually be...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Today, my guest is Brian Balfour. Brian is the founder and CEO of Reforge, a company that I've been a long-time fan and advocate of. Historically, Reforge has focused primarily on teaching courses on product and growth, but more recently they've transitioned to building their own products, including a product called Reforge Insights and a bunch more really cool stuff coming very soon. 

(00:01:18):
Prior to Reforge, Brian led growth at HubSpot, and over the course of his career, he has seen the rise and fall of every major distribution channel, including Facebook's ad platform, Google Ads and SEO, and the Apple App Store. Based on what he's seeing, he is predicting the emergence of a brand new and powerful distribution channel that will likely arise in the next six months, centered most likely around ChatGPT. It is really rare for a new growth channel to open up. It's been a long time since the last one appeared, and the people who recognize this and hop on it early are the ones that reap the most rewards. So this is a huge deal. 

(00:01:54):
In this conversation, Brian shares what he's predicting, what he's seeing, why this is a big deal, and what you should be doing about it right now. I highly recommend you listen to this full conversation and discuss the ramifications with your team.

(00:02:32):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX, the developer intelligence platform designed by leading researchers. To thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly, but many organization leaders struggle to answer pressing questions like which tools are working? How are they being used? What's actually driving value? DX provides the data and insights that leaders need to navigate this shift. With DX, companies like Dropbox, Booking.com, Adyen, and Intercom get a deep understanding of how AI is providing value to their developers and what impact AI is having on engineering productivity. To learn more, visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.

(00:03:16):
This episode is brought to you by Basecamp. Basecamp is the famously straightforward project management system from 37signals. Most project management systems are either inadequate or frustratingly complex, but Basecamp is refreshingly clear. It's simple to get started, easy to organize, and Basecamp's visual tools help you see exactly what everyone is working on and how all work is progressing. Keep all your files and conversations about projects directly connected to the projects themselves so that you always know where stuff is and you're not constantly switching contexts. Running a business is hard. Managing your project should be easy. I've been a long-time fan of what 37signals has been up to and I'm really excited to be sharing this with you. Sign up for a free account at basecamp.com/lenny. Get somewhere with Basecamp. Brian, thank you so much for being here and welcome back to the podcast. 

Brian Balfour (00:04:09):
Yeah, thanks for having me. Excited for this one. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):
I'm really excited to have you back. We're just going to dive right in. Essentially, you've uncovered a really important trend or insight about how products are going to grow differently in the future, how growth is changing, and this is something that I think a lot of people need to hear, so I asked you to come on to share what you're seeing. I also think this is just very timely. I think you said you're going to say in the next six months things might significantly change, so I'm really excited to do this. We're going to spend this whole conversation on this insight. To set us up, what is just the big idea? What's the high-level idea here? 

Brian Balfour (00:04:45):
Just like you, I've spent my whole career just really passionate about startups, figuring out how to build products that win, that emerge in new markets, and one of the things that I have learned over time or one of the things you hear a lot from a lot of folks is, to win, you have to really build a great product. A lot of advice boils down to that. And one of the things that I feel like I've banged my head against the wall in a lot of ways in my career is actually telling people that building a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient, and actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution. 

(00:05:26):
So this general partner, his name's Alex Rampell, he's at Andreessen Horowitz, actually wrote this blog post 10 years ago back in I think 2015. In the essence of the blog post, he basically says one thing, which is that startups is a game of trying to get distribution before the incumbent can copy. It's this kind of concept of escape philosophy. 

(00:05:54):
On that note, which I think os a very good summary of what you're trying to do in a startup and distribution, is that we're right now living in this environment where that game of startups getting distribution faster than the incumbent has gotten way harder in a lot of ways, and in some small cases has gotten a little bit easier. But if we think about this, the way that it's gotten harder and some of the things that probably a lot of founders or folks working on the growth side that probably feel is that, one is that incumbents can copy faster these days. That window that you have to get that escape velocity has actually shrunk. It's decreased. 

(00:06:34):
The second thing is that a lot of the organic distribution that we've had, especially over the past few years, has really shrunk as well. Everybody's talking about the decline of SEO and clicks declining, but you also see it in some other cases. A lot of these social platforms don't really let you send as much traffic to sites. LinkedIn just changed their algorithm, which has really dropped organic distribution. Obviously the Twitter-to-X, transition that happened, right? TikTok's almost always been like that.

(00:07:06):
And then the third way that it's gotten harder is that AI's really good at writing software and code generation, and so everybody's feeling this infinite increase of competition, especially at the startup level. YC is pumping out six of the same thing every single cohort. That's what it literally feels like. 

(00:07:23):
So it's gotten way harder. This game, this escape velocity game has gotten a lot harder. It's gotten easier in some very exceptional cases like the Cursor or something where AI has been like the spark. I know you wrote the blog post about the race car engine, and I think you said there's the spark plug in the engine. AI really created that, a new type of spark, a new type of interest of early adopters to fuel some new players in a short period of time. So it's amazing to see something like Cursor overtake market share of something like GitHub Copilot in nine months or less. That's how fast it happens. It's kind of crazy. 

(00:08:01):
But the main thing that people need to understand is, okay, well, if that's the game I'm playing, how to get to escape velocity before the incumbent? What are all the ways to do that and to really figure that out? There's multiple ways that this can happen, but one of the major ways, one of the major, major ways that we always see is that this can happen when new distribution platforms emerge, because when new distribution platforms emerge, startups are usually the fastest to take advantage of them. It's slower for the incumbents to move. It gives startups this opportunity essentially to play this game. 

(00:08:39):
Casey Winters wrote this blog post about two years ago, maybe 18 months ago, about the AI technology shift. His key point was the AI technology shift has been a technology shift that has not come with a distribution shift yet. If you look historically, we've had a bunch of technology shifts from the internet to the cloud to mobile to social, all of these different types of things. Some of them come with new distribution platforms, new ways to distribute products, and some of them don't, but the most powerful ones, the most impactful ones are the ones that do come with these new distribution platforms. His second key point was that these two things don't actually happen at once. Usually you get the technology shift, then you get the distribution shift a little bit later. 

(00:09:25):
Now we're a couple years from that post. We are a couple years into AI technology shift, and one of the things that I am seeing is all of the conditions, all of the ingredients for a new distribution platform to emerge are essentially happening. So I think we're at an inflection point where we're going to see this emerge really fast. 

(00:09:45):
The key thing for everybody to know is that as new distribution platforms emerge, they follow the same four-step cycle and it's a game that you're playing, that everybody's playing. Just like any game, you need to know the rules of the game. You need to know the steps of the game in order to have any sort of opportunity to win. That's the thing that I've lived through once again, both painfully and also in good ways, and is something that I'm keeping my eye on and something that I've been talking about. Before we go into that four-step cycle, I figured I'll pause there to see if you have any follow-up questions on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Okay. This is amazing. Essentially what you're saying is we follow these ways to grow, there's SEO, there's paid growth, there's sales. All these channels have been around for a long time. They're extremely saturated. Everyone's always complaining SEO's dead, it can't grow, the SEO, anymore. It can't grow. Word of mouth is so hard, there's so many amazing things now that's hard. Paid is so hard. It's just all this money just-

Brian Balfour (00:10:24):
Tax are rising.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Exactly.

Brian Balfour (00:10:49):
All these things. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
So all these saturated channels, and what you're saying is there's an emerging new channel that has not yet been saturated, and this is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. And you'll talk about timing because it's a little tricky to even know exactly when to go big on this.

Brian Balfour (00:11:05):
That's right. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:06):
But that's a huge deal. This has been a long time since there's a new way to grow that you can actually use as a lever for growth and not just hope for the best. Okay.

Brian Balfour (00:11:15):
Yeah. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):
Before you get into the cycles, do you want to tease what the answer is, just to give people a little hint, or do you want to keep it secret?

Brian Balfour (00:11:23):
Well, to be clear, okay, so my prediction, we don't have a clear winner yet. My prediction of the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT, in some ways that people probably already think it's happening in some ways that it won't, but the thing that is less important or that is more important than whether I have predicted the exact winner correctly, the thing that's more important is to understand the cycle and evaluate how to determine where you want to place your bets and how to place those bets, which I know we'll talk about.

(00:12:02):
I could be wrong about the ChatGPT prediction and what's going to happen there. I think there's going to be two parts of it. There's going to be what they do with a ChatGPT search experience, but I think the bigger thing will be whatever they do with launching a third-party platform on top of ChatGPT, there's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that, I'm pretty sure it's going to be ChatGPT. 

(00:12:25):
The thing I'm way more sure about is that some new distribution platform will emerge and it will follow the same four-step cycle. That's the key. Could be wrong on the first piece, I am very confident on the second piece.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:40):
Okay. Excellent foreshadowing. I completely agree, if it's anything, it would be ChatGPT at this point. Let's get into it. What are the cycles that platforms generally follow? 

Brian Balfour (00:12:49):
Yeah, and I'll give some examples of this, but let me explain the four steps of the cycle first and then we'll go through a bunch of examples of all those individual steps. The four steps are essentially, one is I call a Step Zero. It's the conditions of the market have been met. Step One is about a moat, Step Two is about a platform opening, and Step Three is about the platform closing for control and monetization. Let me briefly explain each one. 

(00:13:20):
Step Zero is about the competitive market being met, the conditions being met, and there's a few part piece of this. One is that typically what happens is that there is consensus that there is going to be this new huge category. Think social, think mobile, like all those types of things. In this case, these AI like chat platforms, like a ChatGPT or a clock. There's consensus about that, but there's no clear winner yet. We typically have somewhere between five to seven major players really battling it out and they're all looking for what is the edge? What is the thing that is going to help me win? Because all of these dynamics, in all the history, they either end up in monopolies or duopolies, and so the stakes are really large and so the competition is fierce. 

(00:14:13):
That's Step Zero. I think we could all agree that we are in that mode right now. We've got OpenAI battling with Claude, battling with Gemini, and Google with whatever Meta comes out with their new team, so on and so forth. There's huge amounts of capital, there's consensus, all the types. They are in a fierce composition. That's Step Zero.

(00:14:36):
Step One is then these players, somebody essentially identifies whatever the moat is, the thing that is going to help build them defensibility and help them hit escape velocity and become that monopoly or duopoly in that single category. Once they figure out what that moat is, then they need to press the advantage. They need to figure out how to gather that moat as fast as humanly possible. It tends to be that you can't do that by yourself, so you need the help of an ecosystem in order to gather more of that moat. 

(00:15:12):
That typically comes down to third-party content creators or app developers and other businesses. So they all establish a third-party platform that has some incentives built in, and usually the value exchange is, hey, you develop on top of my platform, you add more use cases, more engagement, all of these things to my platform, and in exchange, I'm going to give you something in return. Usually that thing that's in exchange is, I'm going to give you some new form of distribution for your application and for your business.

(00:15:48):
But what essentially happens over time is that we go into Step Three, which is the closing period, which is at some point, all of these companies end up starting to lock down the platform. This tends to happen for reasons of monetization and growth. They either competitively don't want somebody to use their own platform to disrupt themselves. We saw that in the early Twitter days with things like Vine and Periscope, shutting those things down unceremoniously, or they need to find ways to monetize at a deeper and deeper level because all these companies, they have to grow. 

(00:16:32):
Google's the classic example here of just more and more real estate has either been taken up by either ads or their own first-party applications. That's the key is they close it down by doing by one of a few things. They either shut it down entirely, two, they develop their own first-party applications to absorb the highest use cases, or three, they artificially depress the organic distribution that they gave you in the step prior to push you towards paid mechanisms in order to monetize. I think we should go through multiple examples here, but that's the core essence of the four steps. I'll pause there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):
Awesome. So it's essentially figure out what's going to make, create defensibility long-term with your moat, bring everyone in, "Hey, everyone, welcome to Facebook," everyone joins Facebook and then, okay, and all the developers build on Facebook to bring in more people on Facebook and then they're like, "Okay, now you got to pay. There's a toll," but you love this so much and you're so hooked to all your friends that you're here, you may as well stick around. 

Brian Balfour (00:17:35):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:35):
Amazing. Okay, so yeah, a few examples would be great. 

Brian Balfour (00:17:38):
Yeah. You just hit on the first one. This is the first one that I always think about because this is where I learned about this cycle very early in my career. One of my first companies was during the Facebook platform boom, social gaming, all of those applications, and I lived the full cycle in a very short period. I lived the glory days and just the absolute horror days, and it was very painful, but this is exactly what happened. 

(00:18:06):
Let's go through the four steps. Step Zero. Facebook was in a brutal battle with MySpace, Friendster and a few others. People forget this. People forget that there was actually a bunch of competitors at that time, and in fact those competitors were bigger than Facebook. They had more users back in 2007 when Facebook launched their third-party platform. But one of the key things is that Facebook was very early to the insight about the direct network effects in that there's going to create real lock-in that the more friends, the more of the global network that was on there, the more that it was just going to feed and hit this escape velocity.

(00:18:44):
At the time they launched their platform, I think they were maybe one-fourth, one-fifth the size of something like MySpace or even Friendster, Orkut, these are some of the names at that time, but they opened up their third-party platform. What was the value exchange? They went to third-party developers and they said, "Okay, we've created this canvas," they used to call it the canvas, and they were like, "You can put anything in the canvas that you want: an app, a game, whatever. You can monetize in any way you want. We just want this sidebar real estate on the ads. That's what we're really interested in." There was this mad gold rush on that Facebook. 

(00:19:24):
Oh, sorry, the other part of that was, "Not only will you put it there, we're going to give you access to all of these notification channels and feed to get distribution for your application." That was the other piece of it. You had this mad rush of developers coming in and you had this huge social application, social gaming boom. People just grew incredibly virally very fast, but eventually, essentially what happened over time is they kept peeling back that value exchange. 

(00:19:52):
They first were like, "Ah, actually those dollars that you're making inside that canvas area, well, we want a percentage of that." So they changed that. And then they figured out their ad systems and then they started peeling back. They started suppressing access to all of the organic channels that they had. Eventually, they went all the way towards absorbing the highest use case into their own first-party platform, things like first-party applications, things like events, photos, all those types of things, and basically shut down the platform for dead. 

(00:20:30):
These companies that have basically built on top of this platform, the other thing is by the time they started closing all those things down, all those competitors that we talked about, they were so far ahead at that point because they had built off the back of all these developers coming, adding use cases, bringing more users onto the platform, identifying that moat. They were so far ahead, it didn't matter. It didn't matter what the other folks did at that point, and that's what really gives you confidence to start closing down. But there's so many other examples of this if we go through it. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
Just before you give other examples, just something I'll highlight here. One is the moat they identified in theory was the friend graph, I imagine?

Brian Balfour (00:21:02):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):
Just once we have all your friends, you're not going to want to go anywhere. I imagine it's also important to note, this is a natural thing that would happen if you build the thing and it grows and you're like, "Oh, maybe we should change strategy." I imagine not everyone even knows this is what will happen and they organically evolve their strategy, or do you think everyone's just like, "This is now going to be our plan, Step 1, 2, 3, 4?"

Brian Balfour (00:21:32):
I think a different version of that question is I think some people could sit here and interpret this as all these folks are evil. That's not what I'm saying. That's actually not what I'm saying. I want to be very clear on that, because I think this cycle happens because of competitive and capitalistic dynamics and pressures. It's the same environment that enables creating amazing new companies here in the US. 

(00:22:01):
And there's two sides of the coin. You go through this cycle because it's a competitive environment. You're trying to figure out how to beat competitors, and this is one of the strategies to beat competitors. But at some point you just have to continue growing. You have to grow those dollars. The market does not reward flat companies, if anybody's noticed. You have to keep growing, and so they have to keep finding ways to grow as well as prevent their own disruption. TThey can get so big and they can give access, so much access of distribution to new developers, they don't want to enable their own disruption as well as they need to keep growing. 

(00:22:38):
My guess is anybody who is sitting in their shoes owning their platform is going to follow the exact same playbook and the exact same reasoning. Look, sometimes it happens also because it actually is the best thing for the user. Facebook's channels did get super spammy and all of those things, and that was part of the reason they'd play this, but let's be honest, it wasn't the only reason. A lot of it was for these other reasons. I don't think it's evil. You just need to know how to play the game. That's competition, that's business. They're playing you, so you need to play them. That might be a little sadistic or something, but that is business. You're in a game of competition.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):
Essentially, the incentives are pointing you in this direction. Capitalism, they say capitalism works, and so it'll pull everyone in this direction even if maybe they want to avoid it. Let's do a couple more examples.

Brian Balfour (00:23:33):
Yeah, we'll go through them quick. I think everybody's probably... Google's an interesting one because it played out over a much longer period of time. Facebook happened over the course of about in five-ish years, something like that. Google did it very slowly over years, but same thing, early massive competition against Yahoo, I don't know, AltaVista, Lycos, you name them all. That was even before my time. They were first to really identify these data moats and incentivizing essentially web developers, content folks to optimize for their search algorithms, create this great distribution mechanism. Everybody's building content and everything for them, but over time, slowly but surely they did two things. 

(00:24:19):
One is more and more that real estate became ads that they were monetizing, so they're suppressing organic distribution in order to push people towards the ads, as well as absorbing a bunch of the highest value first-party use cases, things like travel as an example, or even restaurant search and all those types of things. The former Yelp CEO and founder has been out there saying a lot of things about these practices. So, same exact cycle.

(00:24:48):
Mobile went through the exact same cycle. iOS created a new distribution mechanism. They had a ton of competition among different phones when they first started on. They found the defensibility was more about the apps, the data and all the developers, created the App Store, all of these types of things, but over time, we've seen more and more restrictions there on that front. 

(00:25:09):
And then most recently, we've seen this happen in smaller places, too. LinkedIn, as an example, first went through this wave with company pages. They were like, "Ah, companies, come on, promote your company page. Bring in more users, all that type of stuff, and then get all these followers." And then of course you get almost no distribution now through your company page because they're pushing you towards ads. And then they recently just did this with personal profiles, too, which is they really boosted distribution for individuals to create content for that platform. They then introduced the thought leader ad format, a way to monetize those individual posts, and now you've seen them really pull back on that organic distribution. 

(00:25:52):
So this happens in big forms and it happens even in smaller use cases as well, but once again, the steps of the cycle are exactly the same. The key part about this, too, is that the broad trend is that the cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time to play the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
Okay, and the big a-ha here is, yes, this will end maybe not great for you, but there's this magical period when they're open to customers and users where you can grow like crazy because they want everyone to come and they give you a distribution. What you're saying essentially is ChatGPT, potentially some other platform, maybe is about to enter this moat.

Brian Balfour (00:26:35):
Yeah. Well, before we get to ChatGPT, I think the natural reaction when you first realize this is, "Screw them, I'm not playing that game." That's what I feel like most people, how they react. Because the unfortunate truth is that a lot of companies don't predict that last stage and end up in a really hard position. So many companies got completely killed during the crash of the Facebook social platform. Apple's 30% tax basically destroyed a bunch of types of applications and business models because you feel like it just wasn't margin-effective. So many companies built on SEO loops that are in serious, serious trouble right now if that's their only channel. So all these things. 

(00:27:33):
I think the natural reaction is, why would I play this game if I'm a startup or a company? You can even see this with ChatGPT, as an example. They just launched these deep research connectors. One of them was my former company, HubSpot. If you sat inside HubSpot and you were just thinking in isolation, you would be like, well, why would I want to make all of my data accessible through ChatGPT and have all of the usage you start to accrue there? That doesn't really make sense in isolation. But we don't operate in isolation. Once again, we operate in a competitive environment.

(00:28:11):
What's going to happen is that if you don't do it, your competitors are going to certainly go to the new platform and your customer expectations change, and you have to rise to those customers' expectations. They're going to start expecting you to be in these new experiences and all these things. It ends up being a prisoner's dilemma, which is, there is no opting out of the game. You have to play the game. So it's better to be early than to be super late to this game, especially, especially if you are a startup. That's the key opportunity. 

(00:28:51):
We will talk a little bit more about how to play the game more, but it's better to be early as well as, then the key, the harder part about it is anticipating that last stage of the cycle and figuring out how to sequence away from something before that last cycle comes. I think that's the key part, but let me pause there and then I'll talk a little bit about ChatGPT and some of my reasoning behind that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:12):
Cool. So what you're saying is not only is there going to be this big opportunity to grow, if you don't take advantage of it, somebody in your space will. It's not only there's an opportunity, but this is something you need to do because you might miss the boat. 

(00:29:26):
I think about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies. If they didn't do that, they would've missed the boat, someone else would've eaten that lunch. I don't know, I'm thinking about the Technology Bros podcast on Twitter right now, TBPN, where they basically figured out on Twitter you can create this livestream and you see it all day in your Twitter feed just like, hey, they're broadcasting, and it's a really cool distribution channel.

(00:29:49):
I think there's a big call to arms here almost of just the opportunities emerging and you basically need to pay attention. You can't opt out.

Brian Balfour (00:29:58):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:58):
Awesome. 

Brian Balfour (00:29:58):
Exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):
Okay, so let's talk ChatGPT.

Brian Balfour (00:30:02):
Look, let's go through this cycle. Right now we're in that competitive environment. Like we said, all those players we talked about, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, all these folks, they are battling it out. We've seen this with the Talent Awards especially over the past month or so. There's no clear winner yet, but there's consensus around the category. 

(00:30:25):
The second thing is then, okay, what's the moat? Has the moat been identified? And who seems to have identified it the first or as furthest along? My hypothesis, and I think there's a lot more consensus around this now than there might've even been three months ago, is that the moat is about context and memory. These models by themselves, if you compare them side by side, they generate the same result, and so the actual difference-maker is which one has more of your context, because it's the context plus the model that produces the best output, and then that starts to accrue to this loop around memory. The more you use it, the more it's able to store a memory around you, which feeds more personalized context, which produces better outputs. It ends up being another one of those flywheels, another one of those loops. 

(00:31:16):
If you look at who's farthest on this, it definitely is ChatGPT. They were the first ones to memory. They've been investing a lot in these different types of data connectors, essentially context connectors, gathering all of this context, so you can really start to see it in the usage. 

(00:31:37):
The second thing is, and one of the pushbacks I've gotten on my prediction has been, well, what about Google and Gemini? They have so much distribution through Chrome and all of this other stuff. Deedy Das, who's a VC at Menlo Ventures, actually published some good data on retention of all of these different ones. 

(00:32:00):
I think the second reason I predict ChatGPT is if you look at history once again, it was never the person who had the biggest distribution at the moment of time. It was the one that had the best retention and engagement. Google had the best retention and engagement over the others. Facebook was smaller, but had way better retention and engagement over the others, so on and so forth. 

(00:32:22):
The data that Deedy published clearly show that both the retention curves, which I know you and I have both written about at exhaustion, level off at significant portions higher than all the other platforms, as well as those retention curves have been shifting up dramatically over time, you can start to see the effects of memory. They have the very elusive smile curve, the ones that you just like. I've seen all of those dynamics very few times in my career, and they tend to be the folks like Slack and all of the big winners. It's just so elusive

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:04):
The smile curve, just to people who don't know what that is, is essentially retention goes up over time, it goes down a little bit, and then you come back to it and you use it more.

Brian Balfour (00:33:12):
Yeah, that's right, and it's usually the result of some type of network of factor or something else, and it's an early indicator that that platform is on a trajectory to hit escape velocity. 

(00:33:27):
The third piece is that, and they haven't really hidden these, but there's all sorts of signals that they're about to launch a third-party platform. They've been hiring for a bunch of roles. I've seen multiple postings on product manager engineering roles, all that kind of stuff for, quote, unquote, "agent platform" and all those pieces. It feels pretty inevitable that one of these players will need to launch a third-party platform in order to serve all the possible use cases on these tools. There's going to be some value exchange, which is like, hey, for your agent to be effective, you probably need access to the context and memory and distribution, so there'll be some value which is, "Integrate to us and we'll give you those three things which is going to drive more users and more usage," and we're going to go through the steps of the cycle. 

(00:34:21):
You can already see this. They're starting to form preferred partnerships with some of the bigger players, which paves the way for smaller third-party players. It lends credibility to the platform. It's like, well, if HubSpot and XYZ are doing it, then I should probably do it, too. It's like that type of mentality. But that's why I think out of all of these platforms, ChatGPT has the best shot right now. 

(00:34:47):
And then, a bunch of folks are always like, "Well, what about Claude? I really like Claude. I use Claude." Well, the problem with that is I think ChatGPT at this point has at least a 10x difference on MAU. If you're a developer and you're comparing those two platforms and you're looking at it and you're like, "Well, ChatPT has 10x the number of users and better retention engagement," it's like, what's the logical choice of which one you're going to prioritize your scarce resources on? 

(00:35:20):
Those are just some of the reasons that my prediction is on ChatGPT. In the blog post that I wrote about this, I actually then played my own devil's advocate and said, "Okay, here are some reasons why it might not be ChatGPT," but I think we're in that part of the cycle. That's my prediction. I might be wrong in the prediction of ChatGPT, but I really think, I feel very confident we're going to see this cycle play out again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):
Two follow-up questions here. One is, what would be the backup if it's not ChatGPT? It sounds like it might be Gemini or Google?

Brian Balfour (00:35:51):
My hypothesis of who's best-positioned but is not executing on it right now would actually be Apple-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):
Whoa.

Brian Balfour (00:35:59):
... because through the devices, they basically can see everything. They have the ultimate view into your context. They're sitting at that level But I don't know what they're doing. From an execution standpoint, maybe they're going to surprise us with something crazy magical, but we haven't seen any external signals around this. That's probably just based on what real estate and where people live in the stack would own. 

(00:36:34):
And then, I think right behind that, I would probably put Google because of owning the context of things like email and the distribution points of search and Chrome and Android and those types of pieces. A lot of people point to them, but my experience with all of their products, going back to the retention engagement thing, is that if we could take a look inside their metrics, I think what we would see is a bunch of fly-by users in their mouse. They're sprinkling the Gemini bucket everywhere. I've literally clicked on it accidentally multiple times. My guess is a huge portion of their mouse is exactly that of what's happening right now. Look, they just acquired a very talented team from Windsurf and from-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:30):
And just the team. Just the team, part of the team.

Brian Balfour (00:37:31):
Yeah. We'll see. Things are changing dramatically on a week-to-week basis, so we'll see if they're able to press those advantages in a very clear way. But I think the window is very small for them if ChatGPT plays their cards right, because they clearly have the escape velocity right now. If they just keep pressing that advantage in the right way, I think it's going to be very hard for Google to counter in the amount of time that's left

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:00):
On the Claude piece, I'll just throw this nugget out, I had Mike Krieger on the podcast, Head of Product, CPO, at Anthropic, and asked him just, "You're losing to ChatGPT. How do you approach the future of Claude?" He very specifically said, "Yes, they've caught lightning in a bottle. This is just going to win based on what I've seen at Instagram. So we are specifically focusing on what is Anthropic and Claude incredibly good at, which is developer tools, coding, backend stuff." So they're actually leaning more and more into that. If you've seen the revenue recently, they're making, I don't know, approaching 10 billion a year or some crazy amount of money. They're actually doing super well, just in a different use case.

Brian Balfour (00:38:40):
I'm glad you mentioned this because this brings up something that we skipped, which is, there are smaller platforms that have existed and will also emerge in this environment as well, and that's what you're alluding to. This tends to happen is things end up growing into more niches. Even if you look at social, like LinkedIn emerged as a subset of the social world, but even on these smaller platforms, these new distribution channels, they go through the same cycle. 

(00:39:12):
I'll give something, really a very opposite example of the ones that I gave. Look at the platform Udemy. They are a platform for course creators. I don't know if most people know this, but when they started, their rev share to creators was something like 80% to creators. They started very high. That brought on all the course creators, got their whole marketplace going, so on and so forth. I believe it was about a year ago they announced that they're essentially pushing that rev share down to somewhere between 15 and 20%. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:48):
Wow.

Brian Balfour (00:39:48):
They're somewhere at 25 and 30%. Another example of they close down organic distribution in order to monetize, all that kind of stuff. The same thing will happen in this AI world. Cursor, it's very clear Cursor's on the path to also probably create some type of agent platform for developers. That'll be a smaller ecosystem to play in for some products. It feels like everybody has the same strategy at this point is everybody wants to launch an agent platform. I imagine some of these other horizontal productivity tools will do the same thing, maybe like a Notion or an Airtable or a Monday.com or something like that. 

(00:40:31):
There will be smaller platforms that will emerge, and they will follow the exact same cycle that I'm also discussing, but in terms of the biggest consumer one, that's where I think ChatGPT has probably the most escape velocity and others will focus on different areas. Just to be clear, I love Claude. I actually use both Claude and ChatGPT-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:58):
Same.

Brian Balfour (00:40:59):
... for different things. I have lots of love to go around for all these tools. My prediction has no bearing on which product I like the most right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):
Also love Claude. So the key point here you're making is that there's almost a number of distribution channels emerging. Many of them will be niche. I think of LinkedIn. LinkedIn for me has a very targeted audience, for folks that listen to this podcast. Even though it's not, I don't know, Google or Facebook or whatever, it's still incredibly valuable for this specific thing that I do.

Brian Balfour (00:41:30):
For sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):
I think this is even more interesting that there's going to be a number of distribution channels that emerge out of this whole AI wave. 

(00:41:37):
The other thing I'll note real quick, you mentioned this idea of everyone's building agents. I just had Brett Taylor on the podcast who's building Sierra, and he made me realize why everyone's building agents partly. One is because the outcome-based pricing that you can charge with agents is incredible because, one, you can actually attribute their impact on your business's ROI. You can actually see this is saving an agent $15 because it solved the case. And it's attributable and it's autonomous. It's just doing it on its own. With that, you can charge per outcome. You can say, "We'll charge you a dollar," every time it solves an issue. So the monetization opportunity is huge and the margins go up like crazy.

Brian Balfour (00:42:19):
Can I just ask a question about that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:21):
Yeah. 

Brian Balfour (00:42:22):
Do you think that has longevity in the sense that... That makes sense in the current environment that we're sitting in right now because people are comparing these outcomes relative to what it costs them today with pure humans. But once again, competition comes in at some point, and so that feels like that creates a pretty ripe opportunity to undercut and come into... and then you have the disruption theory playing out as well. It obviously depends on the infrastructure costs and compute costs to run these things, but I just wonder how much of that is temporary versus something that'll be long-term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:07):
So you're saying that dollar will come down to 50 cents, 25 cents, or you're saying someone's going to come with a whole new business model and disrupt that whole approach?

Brian Balfour (00:43:15):
More the first, yeah. It's just competition erodes that away, essentially, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:19):
Yeah, that's a good point. So margins will be higher for a while, and then they'll come down.

Brian Balfour (00:43:24):
Unless there's something else that creates a durable pricing power, right? 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:31):
Yeah. 

Brian Balfour (00:43:34):
That's probably the second piece of this. Yeah, that's probably the second piece of that hypothesis, I feel like. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:38):
Yeah. I guess the opportunity there, the moat would be the data, similar to how Cursor is collecting more feedback on what people want in their code suggestions, maybe in theory CRF and has more and more data over time, and there's this network effect-

Brian Balfour (00:43:53):
Yeah. That's right. Let me revise that. I believe in that as long as it's paired with-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:59):
Some moat?

Brian Balfour (00:44:00):
... this second piece. Otherwise, it gets competed away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):
Good tangent. Okay, one more question. What is your prediction on timeline for when the opportunity appears, and what do you predict, as of the day we're recording, what do you predict will be the next couple things that ChatGPT, and let's just focus on that, releases to start to open up this platform to get everyone in there?

Brian Balfour (00:44:26):
Well, look, I'll first give the disclaimer that I feel like any thoughts on timing in the AI market have been very hard to predict. It's always shorter. That's where we should buy us. It's always shorter than you think of when something's going to happen. That's what it's felt like from the seat that I've been sitting in. But my guess is this: we're going to see the next major steps of this play out over the next six months. 

(00:44:57):
I think we just saw one of the pieces drop around this, which was, ChatGPT's recently launched Agent mode. It's kind of a general-purpose agent, and I think that starts to introduce all of the users to using agents and they're figuring out and placing it in the different tiers and business models, all of those pieces. But it's likely that no general-purpose agent is going to fulfill all of the infinite use cases successfully. There's two reasons for this.

(00:45:30):
Users struggle with horizontal tools. They can do everything, and that's exactly why they struggle to adopt, and so they typically need more specific entry points. But also, the more specific use case you get, sometimes you need specific UI, specific data, other specific ingredients to properly fulfill that use case for a given audience. I think their Agent mode was a step in this direction. 

(00:45:56):
What I would expect to see play out next is that they will either launch, they will announce the platform with preferred partners, or what they're going to announce first is basically a set of preferred partners, the guinea pigs, an initial 10 to 20 folks that are bringing agents to their platform. What that does is essentially, once again, it's a credibility card. You do special deals with some brand names to give the platform credibility, and it creates this desire from everybody else to come on to the platform.

(00:46:37):
And then the step after that is starting to opening up the platform. This is where we'll really start to figure out what this game is going to look like because they basically have to define what the value exchange is. What are they giving you access to, and what are they incentivizing you with to come onto the platform? That's one version of it.

(00:46:58):
The other version of it is just the replacement to search. You can also see them starting to make more moves here, which is deeper attribution in some of the results, those types of pieces. They're bringing in shopping. That's one of their recent announcements as well, native into the UI. Essentially they will form new monetization mechanisms around that stuff as well. That's actually going to be very important because, going back to the moat around memory and context is that they will want to incentivize as many people to their free tier as possible, but given the cost of AI, they have to cover it somehow, so they're going to need some monetization mechanisms. The more that they can cover that free usage with things that aren't subscriptions, I think that probably also feeds the moat.

(00:47:51):
I think those are some of the next steps on two different vectors, more of a third-party developer platform and more of the content, whatever you want to call it, AEO, GEO. I don't know what acronym is we've all decided on yet. Let me know if we have. I think those will be the next steps that we'll see. 

(00:48:13):
Now, that's what I think for ChatGPT. I think the thing that we should talk about is, essentially what I would advise folks, especially startups, is you're placing bets. At this part of the cycle, you're placing bets. The winner is 100% guaranteed, as I mentioned, and so you essentially at some point will need to make some decisions about where to place your bets.

(00:48:37):
In the Facebook days, all those other social networks, they also came out with their own platforms. iOS had Android and some failed initiatives from Windows. I don't even remember what that platform was called. You can look back and whoever placed through... the iPhone was actually a very, and iOS is a good one, which is, if you had only aligned your bets to Android, you probably lost. If you somehow found a way to play on both ecosystems, you could be a winner. But if you only aligned to iOS, you could also be a winner. You had to have iOS as part of your betting strategy in order to win. 

(00:49:21):
Everybody right now, you're probably at this cycle and you're trying to figure out, well, everybody will need to figure out where are they going to place their chips. How are they going to bet? Depending on how you bet really depends on what your current position is in the marketplace. If you're a late-stage startup, let's start with that, or a late-stage company, you can afford the luxury to place multiple bets and spread your chips and wait it out a little bit to see who the winner is, and then really throw your muscle behind that winner. You have that luxury a little bit. But the risk of that, the risk of that is that sometimes the incumbents wait too long to make that decision, and that's the key question they will need to answer. 

(00:50:08):
The key question for startups is totally different. You don't have the luxury to spread your chips. You have to go all in. You have to choose one and go all in. You have scarce resources, scarce attention from the market. It's a totally different ballgame. Higher risk, higher reward, for sure. That's part of the betting strategy for startups. That's what you have to do is you have to figure out your betting strategy, and then we can talk a little bit about how you might evaluate and pick the right course for you. That's where we're all at right now is we just entered the casino, we just put some cash in for some chips, and now we've got to figure out what tables and where to place those chips.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:56):
I love this analogy. Just to be crystal clear about what listeners should do, what founders should do, what product teams should do, the advice here essentially is integrate with ChatGPT, maybe Gemini, maybe if Apple has something, actually integrate with what they launch. It could be a login thing, could be a search thing, could be a connect and suck up your memory in context. The advice here is you need to do this because this is potentially the way that most companies will start to grow and your competitors may overtake you.

Brian Balfour (00:51:30):
Yeah. If we had to really simplify it, it's essentially, play the game. Don't opt out of the game. Don't trick yourself into thinking that you can't play the game. That's number one. Number two, no matter who you bet on, just make it a focused bet. Because if you look back, all the failures are the ones that tried to play multiple games at once with scarce resources, and that just tends to never work if you're an early-stage startup. So those two things: play the game, put a focused bet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):
This episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear, but a recent survey from Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit the role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's Innovation Workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done. 

(00:52:29):
Miro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential. Guests of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn the unstructured data, like sticky notes or screenshots, into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes.

(00:52:58):
You don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O dot com slash Lenny. 

(00:53:14):
So you were Head of Growth at HubSpot for a long time, and you gave that as an example, HubSpot, why would they integrate, why would they give away all their data so that ChatGPT can suck it up, and you never have to go to HubSpot, you're just working through their agent. Would you at HubSpot be like, "Yes, we got to do this. This is the game we got to play"?

Brian Balfour (00:53:31):
Yeah, 100%, and that's exactly what I think you see them doing. Look, to be very clear, I have not talked to anybody at HubSpot about this. I have not talked to Dharmesh about this, but Dharmesh I think has also published about this. The right thing to do is, essentially, even though you understand how the cycle plays out and you don't necessarily understand what your exit strategy is once you get out, it's better to be early, know that you need to figure out an exit strategy and figure out that exit strategy along the way versus waiting and then being super late and then know what the exit strategy is. 

(00:54:15):
I think that's exactly what you see them doing. They're trying to be as early to this stuff as possible. I think it's a pretty smart play, even though we might not necessarily see what the exit strategy is out of this cycle for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:34):
Going back to that amazing quote that you shared at the beginning of the conversation by, I think it was Alex Rampell?

Brian Balfour (00:54:40):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:40):
Of that startups win by finding a distribution channel before the incumbent copies them. What you're saying here is this is the opportunity for startups to disrupt an incumbent. This is the opportunity for someone to disrupt Salesforce, I don't know, ServiceNow, all these guys that have been around for a long time.

Brian Balfour (00:54:59):
Yeah, it's going to be one of the major ones. Now look, you've already seen players that have been able to hit this escape velocity, the Cursors and stuff of the world. Once again, there's multiple ways to hit that escape velocity, but this is one of the major ways to do it is to basically hitch yourself to a new platform. Look, you did it yourself, actually. You hitched yourself to Substack super early. You took a focused bet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):
I was going to say that. 

Brian Balfour (00:55:28):
Yeah, yeah. I don't know why that just hit me, but you took a focused bet and you've benefited from it in a disproportional way than those that came later. I think that's actually a great meta example here as I sit here and think about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):
Yeah, that's actually the way I thought about when I was moving to Substack. I feel like there's this wave rising and I want to ride this wave, even if maybe it's not the best place or they take a cut, all that stuff. But it worked out really well. 

Brian Balfour (00:55:55):
That's right. I think it worked out very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:58):
It worked out really well. To be honest, it felt like it was too late when I started six years ago.

Brian Balfour (00:55:58):
It felt too late?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):
Yes.

Brian Balfour (00:56:06):
Oh, say more about that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:07):
It always feels too late, I think, to people that join... Silicon Valley, or sorry, Marc Andreessen has this famous quote. He's like, "I came to Silicon Valley in the '80s. I thought it was over, I was too late. I missed all the opportunities." That's fair. There was just a lot of newsletters. They were doing really well. Millions of subscribers. I'm like...

Brian Balfour (00:56:24):
And what do you say to people now who want to join Substack?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:27):
"Learn from this example." A lot of times when people think that it's too late, it's definitely not too late, and it's always only just getting started. Especially if you're on Twitter all day listening to podcasts like this where we're surrounded with this bubble of everyone talking about something, when in reality, 1% of people know anything about what you're hearing about every day.

Brian Balfour (00:56:45):
Yeah. Yeah, that's so interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:47):
Okay, so coming back to the advice, say someone is sitting there and talking to their manager like, "Brian just shared all this mind-blowing advice. We got to pick our battles, we got to pick our platform," what would your advice be for them to decide where to place their bets?

Brian Balfour (00:57:06):
I think this is a great question because, once again, put my personal prediction aside for a second, and I would encourage everybody to think about it from first principles from who their audience is, what their product is, what stage of company they're at, their current strengths and weaknesses, you got to take all this into account, but if I had to boil it down to a few criteria, the main things I would think about is, when you're looking at new distribution channels and new platforms to choose on, one, going back to what we said before is the better signal is retention and depth of engagement of the users on this platform than it is pure user level like MAU or some other number of signups, one of those vanity metrics. Look at that number one. 

(00:57:51):
Number two is, there's some element of user quality and ability to monetize the users on this platform. I think the starkest example here would be iOS and Android. Even today it's something like Android has 70-some percent of devices, but only 30% of the market share by dollars, and it's the exact flip for iOS. It goes back to what we were talking about earlier, which was, if you bet on Android only, you probably lost, but if you bet on iOS only, even though smaller user base, you were still able to parlay that into a win later. 

(00:58:31):
The third thing to look at is, as these platforms emerge, just analyze what the value exchange is. What are they giving you to incentivize you to develop on their platform? All these platforms, it's a bit of a game of whoever understands the rules and how to arbitrage the rules the best tend to be the ones with the edge and figure that out.

(00:58:58):
And then finally, fourth on my criteria would be pure scale. Obviously, even if you have those other three, but there's a 200x difference in scale and momentum, obviously you probably have to choose the bigger platform. 

(00:59:20):
But last but not least is as you go through these criteria, these are how you think through entering the game. Once you enter the game, then you immediately need to move to starting to think about how do you exit the game. Knowing once again that that last step is going to come at some point in the future, that there's going to be some closure for monetization, then that's where you have to start thinking through your strategy to exit. 

(00:59:47):
That comes down to things like, okay, well how are you going to own an important part of the user experience or workflow? Or how are you going to accumulate specialized data in context that the major platforms don't have? Or how do you create different types of micro network effects? All of these types of things. So just once again, there is the entrance criteria, but once you figure that out and you feel like you're in the game, you immediately need to move towards, okay, what's my exit plan here, knowing this is all coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):
It's interesting that another way to think about this model you've described as building, the strategy of building on top of LLMs and becoming a GPT wrapper. Because essentially this tech allows you to, say, create a cursor that is incredible, and then you could argue, oh, you're just going to be this wrapper, and they're getting all the money here, everyone can copy you. What's your defensibility long-term? The answer is, what is the moat you will build over time sitting on top of this thing that will make you more and more valuable on term and not have to rely on this thing? It feels like you could use the same framework for building a GPT wrapper business, to use that euphemism.

Brian Balfour (01:01:02):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:04):
Say someone is sitting there today. Is there anything they can do to start making a bet? Is it simply creating an MCP that allows LLMs to suck in your data? Is that the one thing you could do today? Is there anything else that's available today to start using these platforms, or is it just a little too early and they haven't released the good stuff yet? 

Brian Balfour (01:01:25):
It might be just a tad too early. We're right on that edge. Some of the questions I'm asking myself is, I'm going through all of these players and where our customers and target audience live, and I'm asking myself the question, okay, if this player launched some type of platform, how would we evaluate it? So on and so forth. 

(01:01:51):
You can also try to cozy up to these folks. I would place a large portion of my net worth right now that if we could sit in the OpenAI offices at that front desk, that they are having meetings with potential preferred developers talking about this, we could probably sit there and log it. I do think some people are going to be in a place to develop preferred relationships and make a note. If you're in that spot, then you should definitely play that card. A lot of early-stage startups will be in that place.

(01:02:30):
Other than that, I would say, once they launch these platforms, you can't do much else, so you really know what the value exchange is and what they're going to expose for you, but also just be prepared to turn your strategy on a dime and go all in. I think that's probably one of the hardest parts of this is that these things emerge and you have to capitalize extremely quickly. A lot of times, it's hard for leaders to do that because they don't want to create a feeling of whiplash into the unknown, and we've got all these projects in play. You know all the things. I think that's probably the last part of what we can be doing right now versus just staying on top of everything as it emerges.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:14):
As you were talking, this reminded me, I recently noticed that ChatGPT is driving me to my newsletter more traffic than Twitter, and I feel like that recently shifted. I didn't even know this was a thing until I just started looking through my referrals. I'm like, "ChatGPT? What the hell is going on there?" It's like a different version of what you're talking about, but essentially, in theory I could block ChatGPT from... I don't know. I don't even know if I can from... including all my stuff. 

Brian Balfour (01:03:39):
You can in Substack now, yeah. I just saw that setting in there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Okay. Oh, interesting. That's the similar kind of decision is, is it better for me for it to be recommending my stuff and telling people, "Hey, go check this thing out," or is it better to block it off? I think, per your point, and this is the way I felt, take it all. It's good. In that, it's better that it's from Lenny's newsletter than something else. So someone else will come in and eat that market share.

Brian Balfour (01:04:06):
Yeah, that's right. If you don't do it, somebody else is. I think that's also what all the major media publishers are really contending with right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):
I guess I need a licensing deal with New York check. Anyway. Okay. I want to go on a totally different tangent. We weren't planning to talk about this. I know that I said this, we're going to be fully focused on this one topic, but there's something you mentioned to me before we start recording that I think will be really interesting to a lot of people. 

(01:04:34):
You guys at Reforge are now building actual SaaS products that people can buy. It's not just courses. I don't know if people know that, but let's make sure people understand this. There's actually products for product teams, so maybe just explain that briefly, but the thing that I think is really interesting here is you work with a lot of companies now selling them AI tools, and you have noticed a very big difference between the companies that are really good at adopting AI tools and seeing gains from them from those that don't. Talk about just what you see there, and because this is in theory going to be really helpful to companies that are struggling with adopting AI tools and seeing gains.

Brian Balfour (01:05:09):
Just to quickly explain that transition so it makes sense for people, which is, I started Reforge just with the interest that there was all these incredible leaders out there growing on the front lines of some of the fastest growing companies and they have all this amazing knowledge and I wanted to encode it in useful and practical ways for others. That took the form of courses and content and product, all that kind of stuff at the beginning. Along the way, everybody kept asking us to essentially build the tools to implement what we taught. Because with anything, you can learn as much as you want. You can listen to my podcast, your podcast, Lenny, whatever, as much as you want, but if you don't actually put it into action and implement it, then it's not really going to create value. 

(01:05:56):
People kept asking us to really close that gap and we said no for the longest time. And then about a couple of years ago when AI really started to inflect, it really created this moment that, oh, wow, now there's this opportunity not just to encode this knowledge into content, but also into the products, the software, the tools that we use ourselves. So we started to take a really big bet on that and started to develop this new platform for AI-native product teams. 

(01:06:22):
The first product we launched is called Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher, aggregates all the feedback from all the sources, uses AI to analyze it, helps you explore it, but also will start to identify what are the gaps, the things that you don't have in your feedback today and auto-generate the research to go gather all those new insights, so complete the full cycle. We're going to launch two other major products as part of this platform before the end of the year, but we'll save that for some future episode. 

(01:06:53):
So that's been our journey. We've seen inside companies that are going through this transformation from two perspectives. One is obviously selling in that tools, but the other perspective is, for 10 years, companies have been coming to us to help them try some sort of transformation with our learning product.

(01:07:15):
Most companies are not coming to us to just throw a bunch of courses in front of, they're trying to solve some big business problem, some transformation. Now that used to be things like, we've got to figure out this growth thing, or I'm going from sales-led to product-led, or I have more project managers and I need to transition to product managers, something like that. There's some business problem, they're going through some transformation and they saw us as part of that transformation and we got to partake in quite a few of those types of transformation.

(01:07:50):
Now of course, the transformation that everybody's going through is, okay, how do I become more AI-native? How do I adopt this stuff? We've seen a pretty wide spectrum and from both perspectives of how companies are approaching this. I'm sure everybody's seen that AI, we've been calling them the AI manifesto memos from CEOs out there that proclaim, "We are now AI-native," in some grandiose way, but behind the scenes, there's actually some incredibly stark differences in the actual teeth of what backs up those memos and backs up those executive decrees that we should all be AI.

(01:08:43):
Just to point out a few of them, which is, one is that I think the most impactful thing that you can do is form really hard constraints. There's other parts that's like, okay, you want to communicate this, you want to establish an owner of who's going to drive this, you want to build an incentives and rewards, and you see this all playing out in things like building it into your career ladders, or some people are starting to introduce this as questions into their performance reviews, all those types of pieces. But the thing that is actually moving the needle are the companies that are defining incredibly hard constraints. 

(01:09:30):
One company that we worked with developed this constraint that they benchmarked against other companies of their revenue size and the team sizes for those stages, and they set a benchmark that we will be one-fifth, each of our functions will be one-fifth the size. What that did is it created a constraint that you couldn't hire above that level, and it forced people to essentially find ways to adopt AI and do things to replace that. So that was one. 

(01:10:01):
You've seen these other ones, I can't remember from what company, that might've been Shopify or another, who was like, you are not allowed new headcount until you prove to us that you are not able to accomplish this with AI. That's another hard constraint. But you also see these other constraints on a smaller level, which is executives saying, "I will not do a product review or review a PRD unless it comes with three prototypes." Something like that. That's the hardest one. Those are the biggest constraints.

(01:10:33):
I think the biggest change that I'm seeing is, and the things that separates out the top few percent making this change and everybody else is essentially making the hardest decisions, and that hardest decision is going to come down to exiting people. In every transformation, what we see is essentially three groups of folks. We call them the catalysts, the people leading the charge, the people who are experimenting, doing this on their own time, all that kind of stuff. 

(01:11:07):
You then have what we call your converts. These are folks that will make the transformation, they will adapt, but they need structure, they need permission, they need a clear outline, they need a clear plan. I don't say this in a negative way, it's just that that's how some people operate. That's where things like all the things that we were talking about before, which was the decree, the permission, the clear budgets, the rewards, all of those types of things. 

(01:11:37):
But then, inevitably you have a certain percentage that are anchors. They're dragging their feet, they're silently creating friction in the background and all those pieces. There's a big difference in how I think companies are treating and thinking about their strategy for those folks. One group is like, ah, we're going to work with them very passively. Others have set a hard deadline. They're either going to make the transformation by X date or we're going to exit folks. 

(01:12:13):
A lot of people look at this as being really harsh. I think a lot of people would think that, especially individuals, but let me explain it from more of a CEO perspective. A lot of these companies are seeing this AI transformation, the ones that are taking it more seriously, as this isn't adopting new tools, this isn't a light change. This is a fundamental culture change of how we operate as a company. You can't have 20, 30%, whatever meaningful number of it is of your company trying to operate in a completely different way, in a completely different culture.

(01:12:48):
Cultures thrive on density, and that's why there's sometimes the best ones feel like cults. As a result, from that perspective, it's like, hey, for us to be successful, for this to be the best thing for all employees, we all need to be operating around the same culture of principles and stuff. If that's not you anymore, then we're defining a plan to exit it.

(01:13:16):
I would say that less than 10% of companies we see are taking this hard stance, but I would say they are probably the ones that are farthest along getting the most adoption and are seeing the most results of the ones that are taking those hard stances. There's a bunch of other stuff I could talk about, but that's the high level of what we've seen across a bunch of different companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):
That is incredibly interesting. I'm glad we went there. I have a newsletter post coming out soon, probably before this episode, that touches on a lot of advice along these lines. I am excited for you guys to keep seeing these insights into companies and sharing more of this because this is I think what a lot of people are looking for, just like things aren't quite clicking at our company. We keep hearing everyone just getting so much more productive. All these companies are running more efficiently and it's not working here. I think that's the kind of advice a lot of people are looking for, so thank you for sharing all that. 

(01:14:09):
Brian, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on? Anything else you wanted to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Brian Balfour (01:14:15):
Well, actually, just a couple more points on this topic we should go. There's probably two more things I would say about this. One is that, if you're a CEO listening to this, I would say that most CEOs or most executives are incredibly disconnected from the actual AI adoption taking place inside their companies. I think a lot of executives who have done these decrees and all that kind of stuff think it's happening naturally, but we talked to both groups. We talked to tons of end users and we talked to tons of executives. 

(01:14:49):
The story we hear from the end users, the PMs, the eng, all that kind of stuff that we talk to using all this stuff, one of the main questions we ask them is, if we're talking to somebody who's picked up a prototyping tool, say, "Well, how many other people on the product and design team are using this?" Almost 90% of the time it's like, "Ah, it's me and this one other person," and everybody else hasn't taken it up. So there's a huge disconnect. 

(01:15:17):
We heard one story, and I can't say the name, but it's a company we all know. It's a major tech company, a tech-forward company. CEO's been out there talking about being AI-native. We talked to one of their principal PMs. Person was early to the prototyping tools. This person shared a prototype with the designer, the eng manager. The designer and eng manager escalated it to the VPs. It caused this whole conversation. Month later, it was still stalling out. This PM happened to then attend a happy hour where the CEO was at and approached the CEO and told the CEO about the experiment that they were running with prototyping and stuff, and the CEO was like, "This is fantastic. Where is it at right now?" He was like, "Oh, well, X, Y, Z happened." The CEO had no idea. And then the CEO is like, "Okay, let me take care of it," and then the next day, it happened.

(01:16:18):
So one is that you have to go to the ground floor on this stuff. Some of the best companies like Shopify and others are measuring actual adoption and usage. They've gone to the extreme on that front to get a bunch of signals and close to the ground. It just goes to show that this is... I don't think we want to talk about going founder mode, but the reality is it's not just about getting into the weeds of your product, but with something this sizable, you got to get into the weeds of the transformation to really understand what's going on and adopt it. That's point number one. 

(01:16:58):
The second point I would say is Fareed, we do this podcast called Unsolicited Feedback, Fareed Mosavat had this great quote on it. He was like, "Look, your output is constrained by the slowest part of your system." That stuck in my head because it's absolutely true. If you think about AI adoption as a system, there's all parts of the system that could be slowing adoption. It might be that people don't feel permission or they don't have the budget or they don't have the knowledge, all these types of things. In a lot of these cases, it's things like IT, legal, procurement are the slowest part of the friction and are setting the pace of all of this output.

(01:17:43):
You can also see this in just product teams. There's been all this talk about product managers are becoming the new bottleneck because engineers are speeding up. Well, that's because people are speeding up one part of the product system and not the other parts, which makes sense. They adopted all of this tooling for engineers because they're the biggest head count and the most expensive and all that type of stuff, but product is an output of design, PMs, and engineering. The system is there not to produce code, it's to ship product, and shipping product is the function of those three things. 

(01:18:19):
If you just accelerate one part of the system, you're just going to move to the bottleneck to another part and your actual product output, the output of the system doesn't accelerate, either. I think people have to really understand those two things: what is actually happening on the ground floor, and what is the slowest part? What is the thing that is causing the slowest part of the adoption? Just attack them ruthlessly if you're really serious about making this transition.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:47):
What a wild time we're living through. So much changes. 

Brian Balfour (01:18:48):
It is a wild time, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):
All these ways that we're all so used to, okay, this is how we do it.

Brian Balfour (01:18:54):
Yeah. It's exciting and exhausting at the same time, man. That's how I think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):
Such a simple way of describing the road.

Brian Balfour (01:19:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:03):
Oh, my God. Okay, Brian, is there anything else before we get through our very exciting lightning round?

Brian Balfour (01:19:08):
That's it. Let's do lightning round.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:09):
Here we go.

Brian Balfour (01:19:09):
Zap, zap, zap. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:11):
Ding, ding, ding. All right, Brian, I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Brian Balfour (01:19:14):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:14):
Okay. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Brian Balfour (01:19:20):
My God honest answer is that I have not had the time to finish an entire book since I had my second child. From a complete book standpoint, I have not been able to... Things that I actively read on a regular basis, just other content out there that I'll throw out there is, gosh, Jamin Ball from Altimeter Capital writes this great newsletter called Clouded Judgment, which is mixture of market thoughts as well as market stats. That's really useful to help me keep a pulse on the market. I was just reading through some stuff from NFX that's been pretty good lately on all of this. I know James Currier and I, we lived a lot of the same cycles through social and stuff, so I tend to identify with that. I don't know, those are two things that I love reading.

(01:20:19):
Sorry, I'll give one more shout-out to a different podcast, which is from two guys at Spark Capital, Nabeel Hyatt, which I know from my early Boston days, and Fraser, sorry, I'm blanking on the last name right now, who was Head of Product at OpenAI, and they've got a great format where it's just those two riffing on some ideas and stuff. I highly suggest that one. I like that one a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):
Here's my reading tip that has changed my reading habits. Bryan Johnson, the longevity guy, he has this advice for better sleep, which includes, before you go to sleep, read for 10 minutes in bed. 

Brian Balfour (01:20:58):
It does put you to sleep. I don't feel like I retain anything that I read that close to bed, though. Do you feel like you retain it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:05):
I do, I do. I'm reading fiction. It's nonfiction. Sorry. You want to read something calm, not like I'm learning. I'm reading fiction and it's really nice. Knowing that this is going to help me sleep better makes me motivated. 

Brian Balfour (01:21:17):
There's an incentive. There's a reward there. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:19):
The reward, yeah. 

Brian Balfour (01:21:20):
They're talking about rewards and creating behavior change, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:23):
Exactly. The reason to do it is this whole thing is you want to get to low resting heart rate, and that helps lower your resting heart. 

Brian Balfour (01:21:29):
I've got some other sleep tips on that front if you want to go down that path, but we'll save that for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:34):
Please, for the third podcast. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really recently enjoyed?

Brian Balfour (01:21:40):
It's not new, but I just rewatched Silicon Valley that I hadn't watched in a number of times. It's painful because the first few seasons, I went through almost every one of those moments in my first startup, like hiring the gray-haired CEO, the funding falling through at the last second, all the crazy stuff, but going back and watching that, there's just some extra nuances and stuff that I feel like they wrote really well that I thought was really good. I've really been watching that. 

(01:22:16):
The other thing that I've watched is just more of a just pure entertainment, calming thing, turn the brain off is Owen Wilson's new show on Apple TV, Stick, which is about him as a former professional golfer and all that. I won't ruin the show and stuff, but it's a very nice calming, little bit fun type of show. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
I've been seeing that on my Apple TV. Maybe I should check it out. Good tip. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? It could be a gadget, it could be a app on your phone, it could be something in your computer. It could be nothing at all.

Brian Balfour (01:22:54):
You can't see it, but I just changed my whole setup. Now I have a UltraGear super-wide curved screen with a very nice standing desk from, I believe it's called Ergonofis. Er.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):
Ergonofis?

Brian Balfour (01:23:15):
Yes. I think it's Ergonofis, E-R-G-O-N-O-F-I-S. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:21):
All right. 

Brian Balfour (01:23:21):
It's a very nice, sleek standing desk. Very stable, very quiet. Very much enjoy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:29):
Excellent tip. And the curved monitor, very cool. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life, something you share with folks, something that you think about when times are hard or just generally?

Brian Balfour (01:23:42):
Look, it's a little cliche at this point, but it's somewhere around here, I used to have the quote printed out about the man in the arena. Especially in times like this where so many things are changing and there's so much competition, but so much opportunity for great, I really both respect and enjoy the game and spending time with folks that are in the arena figuring this stuff out, tinkering with things. That's what I keep coming back to, especially been at Reforge for 10 years, that's a good portion of my life, and we've gone through some great periods and some tough periods, so I tend to come back to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:30):
And that's what always separated Reforge from so much other content and advice is it's people in the arena sharing their wisdom, not just a bunch of influencers. It's sad that Chamath made that quote so cringey.

Brian Balfour (01:24:41):
I know, I know. That's why I said it's a little cliche cringe right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:47):
Screwed it up for everyone. 

Brian Balfour (01:24:49):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:49):
Final question. Brian, you don't know this, but your parenting advice on Adam Fishman's podcast-

Brian Balfour (01:24:54):
Oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:55):
... really impacted my parenting philosophy, specifically this line you had about independence.

Brian Balfour (01:25:01):
Oh, yes. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:02):
I'd love for you to just share that insight about how you think about raising kids,

Brian Balfour (01:25:08):
I wish I could remember where I grabbed this from so I could attribute it properly, but basically, the philosophy is, if you think about going from when they're born until they're essentially 18 and leave the home, your job as a parent is to essentially make them more and more independent. What that involves is continuously looking for opportunities for them to make even bigger and riskier decisions for themselves as they grow up and you're there as a support to those decisions, but letting them make those decisions on their own so that by the time they're 18, they are a fully independent person able to think through those decisions themselves. 

(01:26:03):
Now, look, my sons are young. They're five and three, so it's not like I'm having them make life and death decisions or where we might buy our next house or stuff like that, but it's even small things at this age of... My oldest, five and a half, is really starting to learn and get curious about money and how you spend money and where new things come from and how you earn money. Rather than just buying things for him, he's got money from his grandparents and stuff saved up, and we can be like, "Okay, you can buy that thing, but you're going to spend this," and try to teach him the consequences and all that kind of stuff, and then when he breaks something...

(01:26:50):
It's just small things like that, but thinking about the time from zero to 18 as this spectrum of independence and being a supporting role in what you're essentially doing is you're trying to move as many decisions, the percentage of decisions you make for them down to zero by the time that they're 18. That's something that I've kept in the back of my head since really seeing that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:19):
Thank you for sharing that. I know I didn't tell you that I was going to ask you about this, so that was a beautiful way of summarizing it. 

Brian Balfour (01:27:25):
Yeah, I couldn't remember that whole podcast. I had no idea what I said, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:25):
I would say you nailed it.

Brian Balfour (01:27:28):
... that's a good one, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:31):
Brian, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and where can they find the products you guys offer? Whatever you want to plug. Also, how can listeners be useful to you?

Brian Balfour (01:27:41):
Check out reforge.com. Check out our new products like Reforge Insights. They're on the website. You can find me personally, my writing, including a bunch of the stuff that we talked about today now on Substack. Just recently moved. You can either go to my website, brianbalfour.com, where I have some info or just the blog.brianbalfour.com where all of my new writing is taking place. Those are the two major pieces. 

(01:28:08):
Last but not least is that, as I mentioned, Fareed Mosavat, who I used to work with at Slack, we have this fun podcast. The two of us get on there and riff like we were having dinner every couple of weeks about different product and strategy types of things. It's a fun format for us, so if that's something you enjoy, it's called Unsolicited Feedback, where we give feedback and advice to nobody that ever asked for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:36):
That's amazing. Perfect title. Brian, thank you so much for being here.

Brian Balfour (01:28:41):
Yeah, thanks for having me again. This is great. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:43):

## Transcript

Brian Chesky (00:00:00):
Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Today my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years, and my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. This is a very special episode for me and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:17):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:03:06):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today. Jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more.

(00:05:00):
Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brian Chesky (00:05:04):
Well, thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:06):
Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you would be on my podcast?

Brian Chesky (00:05:12):
I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such a successful podcast. But yeah, congrats on everything. This is awesome.

Lenny (00:05:18):
I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at Figma Config and a lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb, and I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. And they were trying to decide should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? So I'm just curious to hear from you, what is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?

Brian Chesky (00:05:56):
I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off-stage. I saw somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function and all the designers in the room started cheering. So I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant, because I didn't actually get rid of the people. And also why did the people in the room cheer? Because that's also a thing we should ask ourselves. And I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did that place come from, that 5,000 designers in a room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function? Because if I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would've cheered. It was specifically that function. So I want to talk about what that might mean. It wasn't the people, it's the way they're working together.

(00:06:46):
So we don't have any longer the traditional product management function as it existed when you was here. But we didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. So we actually started off boarding some responsibilities to program management. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. So we don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. So the most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product.

(00:07:42):
So the basic idea is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it. And a lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, it doesn't work, and they say, "We tried that. It didn't work." And if you say you tried and it didn't work, my question is, was it a bad product, a bad strategy or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product? So that is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence. They do not have control.

(00:08:31):
Now you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? Because I want to say ... I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.

(00:09:09):
I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know ... Heads of design. Well-known heads of design. I told them they're not designers, they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization. Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization. Like design is catching things before it goes out the door. It's not actually typically part of the development process. And I think this is not just bad for design, it's bad for product managers and engineers because we all want to build the best products. And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomenon might have happened. And if people are watching this from a large company, here might be some of the characteristics.

(00:09:43):
The first thing you notice is that these different groups might be running on slightly different technical stacks. That's the first problem. And they may actually be accumulating technical debt. The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies. So five teams are going different directions, but they all need a payment platform. And so what happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block. And then at some point they just give up. So then the teams that are dependent on other people say, "Give me the resources and I'll build this group myself." So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign or to leverage some service, they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups. So now they're really becoming separate divisions. And this is where a division comes from.

(00:10:34):
Now, once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority. So now you have to advocate for your division. So there's a lot of advocacy. If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships. And so the people that are liked that build the best relationships are the ones that get the most resources and that creates what we call politics. And so now politics that brood in the company. And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided. And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what. People are going in different directions and that creates a lack of accountability. When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter and that creates complacency. And then suddenly a fast-growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy. This is a general arc that winds up happening.

(00:11:30):
And then you end up having this situation where a company's done 10 marketing efforts, but no customer's heard anything. They have thousands of engineers, they shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did. Marketing and engineering don't talk to each other. It's not even they hate each other, they're in different universes. I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close is engineering and marketing? And marketing is at lot of companies are like the waiters, engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters and they go in the kitchen. In fact, the waiters are the ones talking to the customers all day and they also know how to sell things so you really want them being enjoined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.

(00:12:17):
So this is the problem that we had. And also the other thing we were doing is, as you know Lenny, we were spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually my co-founder who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marking is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is. But if you do need to laser in and balance supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing though doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want an arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits.

(00:13:23):
So a lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy. Product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously we did one today we can talk about.

(00:14:26):
The entire company works together. They row in the same direction. And the product management also does the product marketing. So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there.

Lenny (00:15:24):
That was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about. So I'm going to-

Brian Chesky (00:15:27):
Oh, gee. So we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deep.

Lenny (00:15:31):
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single roadmap you talked about. And what this reminds me of is I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a public company and he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build, and then over time they're encouraged to delegate and to empower and it leads to a bunch of optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics. And then eventually you realize I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.

Brian Chesky (00:16:08):
That's exactly how it went, and that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of. By the way, I think that many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to step away and delegate their product to other people, but suddenly they've delegated away the thing they're best at. The thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief product officer title, but if we had one, it would be me. I wouldn't have a chief product officer. I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech company. If the CEO is not the chief product officer then I don't know if they're a product or tech led company. Maybe that's okay if they're an ops company or if they're a marketing company or if they're not a tech company at all. But ultimately I think the founder or CEO should be that person.

(00:16:59):
So when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us. As you know, I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did ops, I did a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product.

(00:17:27):
And I always remember Lenny there was this paradox where the less involved I was in a project ... Let me be clear. There were times I inserted myself and dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And that was just a learning experience for me. But there was this other scenario where the less involved I was in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved. And the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Because people assume that our natural equilibrium's to move fast so if we're moving slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership and therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for initially, they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always, it seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster so I'd empower them and move slower.

(00:18:26):
And again, how that happened is what I described. That you end up in a situation where you're delegating down. So I think that things were getting worse and slower and slower and slower. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. And by 2019 we were spending a billion dollars on AdWords. We weren't really investing in the brand. We were doing a huge amount of AB testing. I think AB testing is important in times. Actually, let me clarify AB testing. We don't test blue versus green. We have a control and a treatment like I think we did when you were here. So we have a design. We might do a holdback occasionally to see how the thing is working. But if we do an AB test, there has to be a hypothesis. If we don't have a hypothesis and A is better than B, then we're stuck with B. And that's a really, really big problem, but we can never change it.

(00:19:27):
And then imagine 10 teams doing AB testing. Imagine if you designed software the way you designed a house or design a house the way design software. And we AB test a sofa. And we said, well, how does this sofa work? And it seems like with this sofa that we've AB tested people spend more time in the living room, so therefore people are going to like this room better. But actually the sofa has a relationship to the end stands which have a relationship to the lamps which have a relationship to the carpet or the rug which have a relationship to the television which have a relationship to the house and everything else. So you have to think about the whole cohesive system. And I started realizing that. I asked one person on your team, somebody you know well, and I asked him, I said, "I feel like I open our app and the product hasn't changed and four years." I remember saying this, 2018, 2019. And this person described that you know well as just the way we were doing things. The initial way we were doing things to move fast had made us move slow.

(00:20:29):
So what we ended up doing is ... It was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems to not change, costs are rising. I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics. By politics I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole company. More bureaucracy meaning meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio a week. And I didn't really quite know what to do.

(00:21:03):
And then right before the pandemic, I meet two people that really affected how I thought about things. The first was Hiroki Asai. Hiroki now works at Airbnb. He's one of my executives and actually product design, product marketing design and marketing report into him. And he was a creative director for Apple. So he worked for Steve Jobs, was basically dotted line to Steve for many, many years. Came from graphic design. Eventually ran all of marketing communications. In Apple Marketing Communications, they actually designed the app. They made the app. They designed all the marketing touchpoints for the store. So it wasn't just ads, it was every brand touchpoint they were responsible. So everything flowed through marketing. And so marketing became the governing factor that made everything really organized.

(00:21:52):
I met another person or got reacquainted a person named Jony Ive. And Jony Ive was the head of industrial design and Chief Design Officer at Apple. And they described this way of running a company that was totally different than the way that I was running it. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs it this way today, but the services is turning into a division and they are just so big that I think it's not a one-to-one anymore, but they are still technically run this way. And I had this image of not being divisional because we were running ... We had 10 divisions. We had a flights division and we had a homes division which was divided to pro hosts and core hosts and lux and we had business travel and we had a magazine and we had experiences and we had .org and we had China. So we had these 10 different divisions all going in 10 different directions. And I created this culture where everyone would be a business manager or business leader, general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. And so the company kept getting subdivided, subdivided, subdivided and that made it very, very difficult to turn.

(00:22:57):
And this was all about me delegating responsibility. The problem is if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-led founder ... What are you doing? Strategy, capital allocation. My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things. I was in a lot of meetings. Trying to adjudicate different issues between groups. So then the pandemic occurs and I had this image on mind. It's like I have this dream that I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe and Nate in Bolinas. It was October 2019. And I told them I had this dream that I left the company 10 years ago and they just asked me to come back. And I said, "I was horrified at what I found." And they said, "Well, what'd you find?" I said, "I found a company that on the one hand had amazing culture and people with a great mission, with a brand people really loved, but we lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the longterm. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and cost was rising and growth was slowing." And that was exactly what was happening.

(00:24:20):
And then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God. I remember basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near-death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your life flashes before your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near-death business experience and our business flashed before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back involved in the details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing. Before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, what do we do? We need you more involved. And so I got more involved.

(00:25:05):
And when I got involved, I made the following changes. The first thing I did is I said, everything we're doing has to be written down and put into a Google sheet. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, "We're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document." I'm like, "What?" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things. And so if everyone says, "Oh, Airbnb is simple. I'm only doing three things." Yes, but you're one of a thousand people. So actually we're doing 3000 things. So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of the team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup.

(00:25:54):
So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product which turned to product marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. As a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big, it's just say that's how small we are and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.

(00:26:28):
So we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist. Or there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Jony did. They're interchangeable. I could never imagine Jony out at Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true. So people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.

(00:27:11):
I stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. So we're going to have a roadmap. It's going to be a two-year roadmap. We'll update the roadmap literally every month. People may wonder, well, what if the world changes? Yeah, it changes every day. So the roadmap's something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out it changes. It's a rolling roadmap. And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We house 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there's always unexpected events.

(00:27:54):
I created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I made the group much smaller. I took a lot of product managers, I reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained in actual program management because their roles got much bigger. Program management at Airbnb is a high status job. A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. At Airbnb we said because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We said we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects have to be on the roadmap. And then I'm going to review all the work. And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said I'm getting back involved in the project and I'm going to review all the product and all the marketing. So every project I would review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks or every 12 weeks. There'd be a cadence.

(00:28:46):
And then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship. Whether we thought they were work, we don't know until after we ship it. But I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, "Why isn't this happening?" And we would all get together. And so you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. It would be like I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.

(00:29:25):
Because imagine if we're a car company and I see the car prototype every week and I notice there's something about the tires off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. So every week I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify with teams the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace. And so because we had all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate people going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. So these were some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Wieden+Kennedy or ChiatDay or any of those anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.

(00:30:32):
The creative group does not just the ads but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. And writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing. Unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes.

(00:31:16):
Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there because they might not always be there.

(00:32:17):
I basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement, and I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

(00:34:15):
You guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways, in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them. Paid growth and maybe SEO, maybe referrals at least for a while. And you've shifted to let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. And our bet is that's going to grow. Do you feel like this can work for most other products or is there a consumer specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this?

Brian Chesky (00:34:53):
I think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion and we will do some experiments. Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passes. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field, and a lot of companies that do 80% running down the ball down the field and 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone.

(00:35:33):
Here are the things I believe. I'll give you a checklist. Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as this chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they really are running separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain. Because you can't manage people devoid of their work.

(00:36:18):
Imagine a fire chief and they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want hold the product back. I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Eames that said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness, it comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason or the product person is a designer.

(00:37:25):
I would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution. Understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.

(00:38:18):
I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. And you should think of your company in a five or 10 years story. You may not know where you are in 10 years, but you're telling this ongoing story. And most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, actually I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?

Lenny (00:38:48):
Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it. Your winter release. And it is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.

Brian Chesky (00:39:00):
Let me just back up Lenny. You know this problem really well. One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together and we have all this unique inventory and people list it on Airbnb. And every home is one of a kind and we have seven million homes and there's all this surprise and all this delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're going to get. And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth. Where when you open the door you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. And when we survey guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one ... Hotels are not as special, they're not as unique, but the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.

(00:39:56):
And so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's achilles heel, or at least it has been. That with hotels you know what you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know what you're going to get. And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets, plus all the host cancellation data and we use all the signal to create the top two million homes. This collection of two million homes that we call Guest Favorites because the guests rate the highest. We think combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with a reliability you've come to expect in a hotel and I can't imagine there's a lot of use cases where you wouldn't want to book a Guest Favorite.

(00:40:50):
We think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. You see, as you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale through living together certainly. And we felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade. So we obviously made some upgrades to ratings and reviews. The final thing, and this brings up another point I might bring up, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is accurate. But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. So they might not describe perfectly their listing, they might not have filled up their amenities, they might not have a photo tour. And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage their listing. And it was hard to manage their listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.

(00:41:47):
Oh, here's the other thing, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and host team. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team. The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guest and host. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions that become incompatible. So we have product marketers that are responsible for guests and host things, but the designers and the engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project.

(00:42:25):
And then we keep some people, especially the product marketing people on a domain area, but we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface. And so that's what we did. We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed. It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we ever designed. If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of the design we've done. By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic. I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather, but I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.

(00:43:24):
I think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment. Light, texture. I think it's more intuitive, it's more playful. I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces. People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more dimension to it. And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic that I think it's going to be where a lot of interface design is going. And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer visioning language that we trained on 100 million photos and it can basically scan all your photos and organize them by room. So that's what we did today. Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would've been possible in the old way of working. We could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but really getting them to work together has been key. And Guest Favorites has required the guests, people ... You have to work with guests, you have to work with hosts, you have to essentially ... You have to figure out how to communicate to the market. So it's a much more integrated approach.

Lenny (00:44:41):
The designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute. You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures on it. It is really cool. Also, the listing tab. I think people that aren't hosts don't understand how important the listing experience is to a host. How many hosts are there? Seven million? Something like that?

Brian Chesky (00:45:00):
There's seven million listings. Over seven million listings.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Yeah. And so that's the home base. That's like the small business platform for millions of people. And so I worked on the host sites. I have a special place in my heart for host features, and I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.

Brian Chesky (00:45:18):
Well, yeah, you did some amazing work there. Yeah. The big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to create a great guest experience, you need great hosts, and to have great hosts, they need great tools. And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with building great tools for hosts to enable them to provide a great experience for guests. And so that was one of the theories behind the listing tab is we're going to build great tools for hosts. They're going to love it. And we also felt like if we put care in the design of our app, that hosts are going to see that and that they're going to actually put care into hosting. Even more than they already do. And they do put a lot of care in now.

Lenny (00:45:55):
Speaking of great products, a defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think. How you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you is in meetings, we present our goal and you're always saying, "How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?" And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10X'd them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?

Brian Chesky (00:46:32):
As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero. Add a zero at the end, which is to imagine something you order, imagine it bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently. And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10X scale or 10X better or 10X faster where you can't do the current process to do it. You have to think differently about the problem. And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem. And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.

(00:47:22):
And we might call this first principle thinking. What are the foundational elements that comprise this problem and how can we reconstruct them? So the first thing is I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams, that helps them understand a problem. The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do. And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, "Okay, let's circle back on this next week." No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Okay, let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, how do we do this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.

(00:48:18):
But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think, in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once ... I'm going to paraphrase what he said. What is your secret to success? And he said, "That I just asked my players to do their very best." And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.

(00:49:04):
When I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying, you're not good enough, or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me. So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you, and I know that you have more in you. And the way to know if a team could do better is if they're life dependent on it, could they do it? And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. And motivation is if they're life ... Not literally dependent on it, but if it was a crisis or if it was a defining moment in their lives. I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death, that's too far, but to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves, and to really push them. To set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving, soul crushing bureaucracies.

Lenny (00:50:06):
I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. And so I've seen that myself. With some of the things you've talked about of say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back and this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and also all these launches, it sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?

Brian Chesky (00:50:34):
First of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly now, the more I get involved ... This is so weird. The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox. And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense. But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything, we would do endless edits of even the press release, it would seem like I would be working 80, 100 hours a week and that people will be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. And I got just the opposite. Here's what I found. If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.

(00:51:20):
And so for one to two years it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted them to do if I wasn't there. And by the way, that's what the culture is. They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room. And so that became our culture. Suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company. There was less turnover. People were rowing in the same direction. That I wasn't reacting. Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction and by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time on my hands initially, and now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.

(00:52:33):
But to answer your question on burnout, I think is another very good question. I do not think I am the poster child, at least historically, of work-life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would've thought the inverse. That I'd have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you need ... Let's say an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives, slower and slower.

(00:53:13):
And so I basically have tried to make it a practice to step away from the work. And so here's some of the things I do. Every other weekend I don't really work at all. And then every other weekend I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend I'd work more intensely. You wouldn't be a parent every other weekend, but I'm not so it's a little different. I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout. So I usually wake up, I'll do 20 minutes of morning cardio on a Peloton. I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights. I'll basically do cardio just about every day. I make sure that I eat really healthy. I have a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. So I try to make sure I do that. I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.

(00:54:01):
The other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important things that will govern how happy you are in your life is your relationships. I think the three things are your health, your relationships, and your work. Those are probably the three most important things. So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships. And there was this Harvard study. It's the longest study on human happiness. I think it's 85 years old. And the question was, what's the secret of happiness? And of course they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one. And the answer was, the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships. And I had found, Lenny, that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn't have friends. I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them. And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them. And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with, including old friends.

(00:55:03):
So I have a group of high school friends, we have a group chat and we take one to two trips together a year. I have a group of college friends, we have a group chat. We take probably a couple trips together a year. By the way, doing Airbnbs are great. We all get in a house together and it's like your opportunity to have a shared experience. And if you don't travel with your old friends, you'll have only old stories to talk about and then you say the same old stories over and over. So you want to be able to have new shared experiences. When I stay here in New York City ... I'm in New York right now. That's why you don't see my typical background. I stay in my sister's apartment. So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her. And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends. And of course we travel. Traveling is what I do with a lot of my friends. And then I like to draw and read. So I try to make sure it's health, work and relationships. And I try to make sure I have a balance of each. And you might call family relationships. I'm single, but that would be another version of it.

Lenny (00:56:02):
I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you're really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone and they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy.

Brian Chesky (00:56:12):
In the old world, I was reacting, so everyone thought I was busy. So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, "Well, he's busy so he'll reach out to me when he's not busy." But here's a problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now that was a mistake. But I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders. A lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll respond to emails, and suddenly their email sets the agenda. People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them. Versus here's my strategy and then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to be able to execute this strategy?

(00:57:05):
If my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would've wanted to make sure I spent time with? And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's possible, it would completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work, but they don't actually move the ball down the field. And I really try to say yes to the work that's very meaningful and people that are very meaningful to me. So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, but it's true of companies too. You can sometimes be ... You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. You do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Just one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run. If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs, you've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale and just to take on this leadership role? Is it coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.

Brian Chesky (00:58:46):
You ask really good questions. And by the way, thank you. I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner, and I told him, "I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet." And he was really surprised. He's like, "What are you talking about?" And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion, but I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel worthy. But I have this beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's a weird feeling. I think when I first took off, I think I thought I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak or you go into this trough where you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.

(00:59:49):
And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. Pablo Picasso had a saying. He said, "It took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child." And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity. To see everything with fresh eyes. To not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure how to run the company, I studied the history of divisional organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied what Bill Gates did. And I studied Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont. They were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do we do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels so they created what we now know as the divisional structure.

(01:00:46):
So I try to understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives, or one of the biggest honor is when other people ask them for help. Because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It gives a lot of them great honor. And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows the latest distribution channels that I have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning, it's growing, it's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better. To feel like I haven't made it yet. Because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. And I want to feel like an artist. Bob Dylan used to say, "An artist has to be in a constant place of becoming and so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay."

(01:02:05):
And so you have to always be evolving, learning, growing, and the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started and I hope that ... I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intend to do this for a long time and if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said I still believe, but if 100% of what I say, I still believe then I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say I don't believe anymore than I'm delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that? By being curious.

Lenny (01:02:59):
That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple of weeks ago that I'll read real quick. "Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in hours of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, et cetera." How does that feel to have seen that?

Brian Chesky (01:03:23):
I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say I think Sam is obviously a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched ChatGPT I had known him for a real long period of time, and I knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and then research part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales. So there were all these other functional responsibilities. And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary ... And he would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.

(01:04:13):
Before Y Combinator, there was a person named Michael Seibel. He's in Y Combinator. And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. And I asked him, I said, "How do I repay you?" And he said, "Well, I want you to pass this on to other founders." And I would meet with a lot of people in the valley, and there was just this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win if the ecosystem was healthy. And the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another. And you pay it forward. I think that it's just one continuation of the valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.

Lenny (01:05:03):
Final question. When someone joins Airbnb, there's a very longstanding tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.

Brian Chesky (01:05:18):
Yeah. A fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. When I was five years old I remember my parents take me to the Norman Rockwell museum and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings I should say. I shouldn't even call them illustrations. And I would try to reproduce them. And I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them. When I got older, one of my friends, I went to his house ... I'm going to say I was eight or nine years old. And his dad was basically redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe he was an architect. So he had this giant dining room table, and he had this vellum paper and he had a T-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor. They were really cool looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings.

(01:06:15):
So I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture. I went to RPI when I was in freshman year of high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing. Then I got into a film and animation. Then I got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This is when the internet was nascent and people still mailed the annual reports. As so I got my dad to buy a few shares at some Disney stock. And I got these renderings and he had a report of theme parks. And I started drawing and designing theme parks in communities.

(01:07:00):
And I was at this private school actually for hockey. Because I had this life where I was playing ice hockey and I thought I was going to play college hockey. My dad was really into it. I was really into it. And I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact. I basically went to a military high school.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Wow. I did not know that.

Brian Chesky (01:07:22):
And at this military sports academy oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade. And that's not a good thing, by the way. I don't say it as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. And so I leave this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey. And I transferred to my public high school late my junior year. And imagine transferring to a new public high school late junior year. And I meet my art teacher who changes my life. Her name is Ms. Williams, and she sees my artwork. And by the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me, "I chose a job for the love, and I got paid no money. So you should choose a job that pays you a lot of money." And I said to my mom, "One day, I'm going to be an artist." She said, "Oh my God, you chose the only job where you're going to paid less than a social worker." So I think my parents, they were supportive of me going to art, but they were very nervous. And then Ms. Williams told my mom, she said, "Don't worry. He's going to be a famous artist one day." I wasn't going to become a famous artist. But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art.

(01:08:31):
I ended up being a winner, there were multiple winners, of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design where I ended up going to RISD. It's like MIT for design or whatever. It's a prestigious art and design school. But I got to RISD and I realized I was born 100 years too late for what I wanted to do, which is draw and paint. And I felt like at that point, photography and now AI generated art, but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. And that's when I was in my freshman year of college and I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.

(01:09:26):
And really, Lenny, maybe just to round out the story, because that was a fun fact, but I'm just ... And this is the pre founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designer is different than a graphic designer. Because an industrial designer, you have to work with engineering in your training. I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers. You have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design's very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design an office building and the office building doesn't get leased, the architect's usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product, it doesn't sell, you're on the hook for it. At least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you had to understand marketing and strategy.

(01:10:11):
And so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. And the day of graduation Joe looks to me, he says, "Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day." And I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles where I work as an industrial designer for two years when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package and it's a seat cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, "I started a company and everyone in San Francisco ... I live in San Francisco and all these people are starting companies. You should come here." And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I had seen all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I'd never heard his voice before YouTube. And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.

(01:11:18):
And so one day I go into work and I quit my job. My boss is dumbfounded. And I pack everything in the backseat of old Honda Civic. I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay our rent. This design conference is coming to San Francisco. All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference? I didn't have any beds, but Joe had beds and we called it Air Bed and Breakfast.

(01:11:45):
So my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb. Really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different. Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity, I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head and they're disembodied from their heart, and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think that some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded way of thinking about the world is good. So anyways, that's my final thought.

Lenny (01:12:37):
I love that fun fact because it almost explains everything you've been talking about, which is rethinking the way companies can run, doing things super differently. So I really appreciate you sharing that. I also love that it transitioned into the creation story of Airbnb, which happens a lot at Airbnb. People hear that story over and over because it's so interesting and so important. Brian, I know you have to run. Thank you so much for being here and being generous with your time.

Brian Chesky (01:12:58):
Thank you, Lenny, and congratulations on everything you're doing.

# Lessons from scaling Uber and Opendoor | Brian Tolkin (Head of Product at Opendoor, ex-Uber)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You've worked at two businesses that have done incredibly well combining product in ops.

Brian Tolkin (00:00:03):
Uber always has this mentality and Opendoor does two of the product operations, twin turbine jet plane where you can fly the plane on one engine for a little bit if you need to, but it's operating most efficiently and effectively if both are working together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):
What has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader?

Brian Tolkin (00:00:21):
Gave a really deep understanding of how the business actually works. It's a pretty good foundation for them going on to say, okay, what do we actually want to build in a more scalable technology way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
Something else I've heard that you're very good at is staying very calm under pressure.

Brian Tolkin (00:00:34):
I've slept on the floor in China before launching uberPOOL, and when you reflect the stress onto your teams, everybody tenses out. It counterintuitively doesn't produce better outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
Today my guest is Brian Tolkin. Brian is currently head of product and design at Opendoor. Before that, he spent nearly five years at Uber where he joined as employee 100. Before Uber had UberX or uberPOOL or any shared rides, he actually started on the ops team at Uber, moved into product, ended up leading product and launch of uberPOOL, and then taking it global. He also started the product operations function at Uber. Before that function was really even a thing, which I didn't know until the chat that we had. In our conversation, Brian shares a ton of lessons about building products with a heavy operational component. Also, how to run great product reviews, how he implements the jobs to be done, framework and Opendoor's successfully.

Brian Tolkin (00:02:00):
Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):
First of all, just a huge thank you to Kayvon Beykpour for connecting us, introducing us. He said all kinds of amazingly nice things about you. He also gave me some very hard questions to ask you. I hope you've come prepared.

Brian Tolkin (00:02:12):
Terrific. Put me in my hot seat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:14):
Okay, I want to spend a bunch of time talking about product and ops. You started your career in operations. At Uber you actually started on the ops team and you moved into product. You've also worked at both Uber and at Opendoor, which have both huge operational components. I think it's really rare that people, one, see a company scale to the heights of Uber and Opendoor with such a heavy operational component that are still tech companies and also it's really where someone starts an ops and then moves into product and ends up where you are, where your chief product officer, really successful company. So I have a bunch of questions here. Maybe the first is just what has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader? How does that change the way that you operate as a product leader?

Brian Tolkin (00:02:58):
Starting on the operations side gave a really deep understanding of how the business actually works. You are truly operating it day in and day out and the success of the city is in large part driven by the inputs that you are putting into it every single day on the ground and whether or not there was rain that weekend, which was a nice driver of metrics, but talking to customers every single day like one-on-one onboarding drivers responding to support tickets, there's no centralized support team, there was no closer to the customer, right? And so I think that foundation actually for really understanding what moves the business and being super close to the customer actually is a pretty good foundation for them going on to say, okay, what do we actually want to build in a more scalable technology way?

(00:06:18):
Try it for free at explo.co/lenny. That's E-X-P-L-O/lenny. I've seen that a lot of companies, and this was definitely true to Airbnb, where the product team looks down a little bit on the ops team where they're like, "oh, we're doing things that are going to scale to millions of users. We're doing these things that are going to apply to everyone." There's this ops team over there doing a few things that are going to not scale. They keep asking us for things to build for their one-off ideas. What do you think that product teams often maybe miss or don't understand about the ops teams that would help them see them in a different light?

Brian Tolkin (00:06:56):
Yeah, it's a great question and I think Uber always had this mentality and OpenDoor does too of like a twin turbine jet plane where you can fly the plane on one engine for a little bit if you need to, but it's operating most efficiently and effectively if both are working together, and I think that's really true, right? The reality is operations teams, local teams, can iterate faster, can scale talking to customers really much more efficiently, have great qualitative insights, and so if it's seen more as a harmony instead of a competition, I think that's really, really helpful where it's like, okay, how do we get the insights that are happening day in and day out in the field, on the ground, whatever that may be, and help us build better products because of that, right?

(00:07:50):
Like a PM sitting in San Francisco can't be in Opendoor's case 50 markets, walking houses every single day in Uber's case, whatever, a thousand cities understanding the nuances of safety in South America and it's just not possible, but what you can do is foster a really good relationship and a really good feedback loop of how people who do deeply understand those things can help give insights. Now is actually the birth of product operations was that insight as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:22):
Can you say more on that?

Brian Tolkin (00:08:23):
Yeah, sure. So, sorry, I should probably define what product operations was. At Uber it was basically this notion that we had centralized, this was later in my career at Uber, but we had a centralized product team building stuff mostly in San Francisco, not strictly through the Ross, but at this point around the world, but mostly in San Francisco and then we had a very globally distributed operations team, and there was a bidirectional feedback loop that wasn't super strong and that feedback loop was basically when the EPD teams in San Francisco built new features, how do we effectively put it in global markets and then how do we effectively get input from global markets to better build features. And so one solution to that problem, our solution at the time was to start up a new function called product operations who had accountability and reported into operations but physically sat with and operated much like a member of the product team to help solve that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):
Is that maybe the first time there's a... Did you invent product operations as a function?

Brian Tolkin (00:09:28):
I don't think so because at the time, I believe Google had a function, I can't remember what Google called it was something slightly different, but I met with a few folks who had been in similar type roles at Google and a couple other places, so I don't take credit for certainly for inventing IT and other people have actually dabbled in this model at Uber before me there was just a formalization of it and our actual building out of the organization, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):
Did none of that. Sounds like you basically helped make it a thing. I know you're being very modest, I think. Coming back to your point about decentralized operations teams, something I've read is that search pricing came out of one GM and a market just testing, emailing all the drivers, hey, we're going to give you extra if you drive on Saturday night. Is that true?

Brian Tolkin (00:10:15):
That would've been probably a little bit before my time, but that being said, one thing that is true is that surge pricing for actually quite sometimes all of 2012, certainly 2013 probably, I don't know when we necessarily switched, was very much a human in the loop system or a very manual system where GMs in every city would control basically the parameters in which surge would operate and so much of the time that would need, for example, Monday through Friday, there would be no search, it couldn't flip on, and then Friday nights and Saturday nights it would flip on from whatever you set, 7:00 PM to 3:00 AM and the cap was X, whatever the cap was. And then within those parameters the algorithm would optimize for what the price was. But yeah, GMs controlled whether it was on or off and what geographies were surging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:16):
Wow, I didn't know that. Was that out of we believe we are better than the algorithms or we just don't have time to make them amazing yet, so we're just going to help them along?

Brian Tolkin (00:11:25):
Yeah, I think it was probably a function of a bunch of stuff, one of which is like, hey, this is a fairly new concept and it's powerful and dangerous and so let's make sure we understand what's happening. The second is this belief that local city teams know their cities best and so you might know that an event is happening, a baseball game gets out and it's like, oh, I know that this baseball game's going to get out at 10:00 PM so I'm going to set surge at 9:45 and the algorithm may not be able to pick that up. And then the third is the technical constraint of nowadays clearly it's all automated, but it's really hard to build a fully dynamic, always on geospatially aware pricing system and not just a little bit of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):
That makes sense. I feel like you're full of wild stories from your time at Uber. Is there one that comes to mind of just, I think you helped scale in China, uberPOOL?

Brian Tolkin (00:12:17):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:29):
Maybe that's the one. I don't know. Can you share wild story from early Uber days?

Brian Tolkin (00:12:31):
Yeah, so in the early days of Uber, one fun story is obviously UberX is a random mainstream product but has a funny, silly name, UberX. This product in the early days was going to be all hybrid and had a bunch of different potential names. I was not personally driving this, this was someone else on the operations team, but they built the model for what this product could be and there's no name for it yet, so it was going to be a placeholder. So what do you put in some placeholder? X. So UberX and then the company was moving quickly enough, the product got the green light, it launched, and here we are, I don't know, 12 years later, 11 years later, whatever it is and UberX is the name that stuck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:21):
That is hilarious. I love it. So it was a placeholder. It's like many products start that way where they're like, this is just the temporary name, and they're like, okay, I guess everyone just knows it this way now we're going to stick with it.

Brian Tolkin (00:13:31):
Exactly. It's too expensive to change and rebrand at this point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:34):
That's an awesome story.

Brian Tolkin (00:13:36):
One that is good about scaling Uber uberPOOL in China is we were launching Uber pool in China and this was going to be, China at the time was pretty big for Uber, but uberPOOL was not there yet, and so we were going to launch. And myself and a few other folks were in Chengdu China, which is the first Chinese market that we were launching uberPOOL in and we were going to be on the ground took to launch. We wanted to go live at, I believe it was 6:00 AM for rush hour on, I don't remember the day, but whatever, Monday morning, and so we're there over the weekend getting ready to set up and at the same time we were doing some data center testing. And so we flipped on all the testing infrastructure and thought it was going to work and nothing works, and the matching algorithm just isn't working and we're like, oh my god, now it's whatever, 5:00 PM the day before we're supposed to go live, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM okay, let's get on the phone with the US, try and figure out what's going on.

(00:14:43):
I remember I slept about 30 minutes that night between 2:00 and 3:00 AM being like, okay, well, we have to go live at 6:00 AM I think there was some press around it. We were planning on going live and I think we got everything finally working at probably about five 30 or six in the morning and launched just in the nick of time. And I'll never forget, we launched, it was great, we monitored, everything was good, and then we walked out for breakfast at 7:30 in the morning. Everyone sleep depressed, no one slept all night and we got these pancakes street food things and I have to imagine they were not that good, but in my mind it was the best meal I've ever had in my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):
It's like a meal after a marathon or a big hike.

Brian Tolkin (00:15:31):
Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:32):
Everything's so delicious. This comes up a lot of just these moments that are so incredibly stressful and hard and leap deprived end up being the best memories and the best stories to tell and things you look back at fondly. It's so weird how human nature is like that.

Brian Tolkin (00:15:46):
Yeah, I mean another one more recent for Opendoor was when COVID hit, physically we buy and sell homes, and so we were physically going into people's homes and suddenly March 2020 going into people's homes was not something people were comfortable with. And you look at the real estate data coming out of China at the time and it looked like coming to a standstill, and so we actually turned off the core business and we stopped buying homes for a few months. hey, we can't go in and we don't know if anyone's going to be buying any homes, and so what do we do? And we took those few months and then came out the other side and had virtualized the whole process. Then it was pretty stressful, right, because looking at a business that relies on going into people's homes and suddenly you can't do that anymore, what do you do? So, again, a fond memory to look back on a very stressful time in the moment where it feels very, very difficult.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):
Just since you mentioned Opendoor, I think many people have heard of Opendoor. Maybe just give a quick explanation of what Opendoor does for people that aren't exactly sure.

Brian Tolkin (00:16:58):
So we're a digital platform to buy and sell real estate. The core product today is a seller focused product where people can go online, enter some information about their home, and we'll make an all cash offer to be able to sell simplicity and certainty. So the product really works for people who want something that is certain and simple and easy. I don't know if you've ever sold a home, but it can be a very, very, very successful difficult process with showings and open houses and how to price it and will it sell and all of that stuff. And so we offer basically a way to skip the whole process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:41):
So you basically sell your house to Opendoor and it's just like, cool, done, move on.

Brian Tolkin (00:17:45):
You picked your closing date, you move out when you want. Yeah, there's no hassle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
Sounds amazing. I want that. Coming back to ops and product, just to close this thread again, you've worked at two businesses that have done incredibly well combining product and ops. Are there any just broad lessons you've taken away from how to make these two teams and functions work well together and to build a business that's very ops heavy but also offer driven?

Brian Tolkin (00:18:15):
The first one we touched on, which is a, there's just got to be mutual respect. Both functions have their time and their place and their skillsets, and you just don't build big businesses of this type without respecting the fact that that both need to exist. The second, particularly on the product and engineering side, is really understanding where and how the technology leverage comes from the business and then being really focused on making sure generally, especially in the earlier days, you are more limited on the technical resourcing side than you might be on the operational resourcing side. And so how do you be really focused on where to invest your time, effort, and energy technically, which is why most of the engineering effort for Uber was on the dispatching system and the pricing system. That's just where the leverage was at the time, given the scarcity of resources.

(00:19:11):
And so I think the second one is being really intentional about where those techs are and then being really forthcoming and saying, hey, that means all these other places where yes, it can make things easier, more efficient, et cetera, et cetera. We are okay not investing in right now, and that needs to be an explicit decision and very transparent. But then the last bit I would say is a deep understanding that the real world has entropy and it's hard and it's messy for us at Opendoor, we go into homes, someone may not be home, scheduling may be off, at Uber the driver may cancel the radio GPS. All these things happen, right? Computers are deterministic, but humans aren't, right? And so building products that have a little bit more flex or a little bit more fail safes in case those things happen becomes a little bit more of a paramount.

(00:20:08):
One other thing, the last thing I would say is I think that the companies evolve as well. So what I talked about at the beginning of Uber being very focused from an engineering and product side on the dispatching system and the pricing system, obviously over time not to evolve now it centralized all of these functions as the company got bigger and more mature and scale and optimization started to be more important and expansion and that Petri dish of trying new stuff and the tools got better and the tech got easier and there was more internal infrastructure. And so over time things can start one way and shift over time as the business needs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):
Let's actually spend more time there. You keep saying things that make me want to dig deeper. So at Airbnb we went through the same thing where there was all these local ops teams driving supply, finding homes, bringing out the platform, and then there's this tipping point where the product in organic growth or word of mouth ended up driving more and then orders of magnitude more. So there was no need for these folks to spend time doing these things. Can you just maybe share an example, either we Opendoor, when you talk about there's a time and a place and a skillset for ops, how that evolved? What was the team doing initially and then what did they end up doing as things grew?

Brian Tolkin (00:21:25):
Yeah, I mean, maybe a very easy good example to pick just one part of the Uber process in the early days is at small scale, actually back when it was Uber black drivers, every driver was individually onboarded in a 90 minute to a two-hour in-person in the office onboarding with deep setting of expectations. The next version of that... So that's obviously very ops driven. The next version of that is a small classroom type setting of three or five or six drivers at a given time. Also, very ops driven. And then as we got into more mass market products like Uber Taxi or UberX, it was like, okay, maybe 20 or 30 at a time. So now it's a little bit bigger classroom setting. And we said, okay, let's make a video. Instead of giving verbally the same presentation, let's just make an onboarding video and that was the next set of scale, but now suddenly we have a different problem, which is okay, you have to validate all of these credentials.

(00:22:32):
So most driver's license who they are, all that stuff at one person, easy at three to four at a time, easy, 10 at a time, a little more challenging but fine. At 20 at a time, okay, you're starting to run up onto it now you fast-forward six months and you're doing a thousand a week or whatever, suddenly your system breaks and it's like, okay, we have reached the point where operational system improvements is no longer viable. So, you say, okay, we have gone from the iteration stage to the scale stage and technology is uniquely good at scaling. So now we say, okay, instead of having a bunch of folks around the world taking pictures of driver's licenses and validating and doing all that stuff, how do we integrate with some type of OCR technology or auto recognition of driver's licenses that feeds to a system that knows what a driver's license is or can do automatic validation and suddenly you've done two things.

(00:23:27):
One, you've scaled your system, and two, you've just created a ton of time for what at the time was probably dozens if not hundreds of people running these onboarding sessions all over the country, the world at the time to do other stuff. And so now you can level that up and say, okay, do we do more analytics? Do we do more figure out the next process that needs optimization or whatever the case may be in that virtuous cycle just continues.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:53):
The way I like to think about this is do things that don't scale and then scale the things that you're doing. That's the phrase I always come back to.

Brian Tolkin (00:23:58):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
This reminds me of a hot take that previous podcast guest shared in a newsletter post Casey Winters. He talked about that operations is usually, and it's a hot take, that operations is a sign of inefficiency and over time your job is to squeeze that away and make it product software as much as possible. Doesn't mean you always get there. Thoughts?

Brian Tolkin (00:24:23):
Yeah, I actually don't. Fundamentally, it depends on what the operations is, but I don't fundamentally disagree, but I think that the right lens to think about it is... And then those folks can move on to the next challenge. And so there's always another hill to climb. And so I think that was one of the things at Uber and Opendoor where there's this culture of on the ground experimentation that's really helpful where we were just talking about driver onboarding may now be solved with technology so you have a few extra hours a day. How do we get better at optimizing the UberX system? How do you start tinkering with food delivery? How do you start thinking about higher capacity vehicles? How do you think about better feedback loop for those manual surge pricing toggles that we talked about? So I generally agree it just generally free across and solve more problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:21):
It feels like a big part of this is making sure the operations teams understand there's more opportunity, even if this ends up being automated, your job is not going to go away. We're going to find something new to try and experiment and do things that don't skip.

Brian Tolkin (00:25:34):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:34):
Awesome. Okay. Going a completely different direction.

Brian Tolkin (00:25:37):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:38):
I hear you're very good at product reviews.

Brian Tolkin (00:25:40):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
A few people told me this. I'm curious how you set up a product review and any things you've learned, any tips for how to run an effective product review?

Brian Tolkin (00:25:48):
That's very whoever mentioned that. But yes, big fan of doing them actually in particular to maybe bridge the conversations in companies that have ops driven cadences or start out very ops driven because the cadences can sometimes be different. And so the operational cadences that you might have something like a WVRA weekly business review may not be conducive to always picking your head up and saying like, Hey, where's the product going on a slightly longer timeframe. And so I think product reviews in general for all companies are probably really helpful, but actually in particular for some of the product and operations led companies. In terms of things I've learned, I think being really intentional about what the goals are, I think it's okay to say that there are two goals, a goal of accountability and inform to an audience.

(00:26:43):
But also most importantly, I think this is the primary goal is to help make the product better, to help the teams think through a problem and to have that, again, back to our earliest conversation, be a very intellectual conversation about the work and how to make the product better and not super scary. Product reviews hopefully are not feeling like firing squads. That's a scary environment to be in and not necessarily one that's conducive to how do we make the product better. Obviously sometimes the conversations have to get a little intense, but in general that's what we're shooting for is something that helps the team go back and think through how to make the product better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:24):
So the two goals you try to communicate for your product reviews, accountability slash informing people what's happening, but also just like we are here to make the product better and setting that context. Yep. Is there anything you'd do specifically to make it not feel like a firing squad? Like you're coming in here to be attacked and criticized? Do you set context at the beginning of the meeting? Is this just a part of the culture?

Brian Tolkin (00:27:43):
Yeah, I think definitely part of the culture, but also I am a firm believer in general that the people closest to the problems also have the best context to solve that problem. And so as a more senior voice in the room, often the job is probing, asking questions, throwing out ideas in a way that says like, hey, this is an idea. This is not a mandate, this is a thought. And if there's context missing that would inform the product direction, then providing that context in not a question asking sense, but hey, this is context that you might not be aware of. And so I think it's all in how you show up as a leader and what that looks like in terms of probing and pushing the team on dimensions that they may not be thinking about. And then understanding that the team is bringing a perspective that you don't have, which is they think about this problem 40, 50, 60 hours a week, and you might think about this problem three hours a week. So you bring them a breath, the team brings a depth in haven't been there yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
I don't know if you heard Dharmesh Shah's episode or his thing on flash tags. Have you seen this?

Brian Tolkin (00:28:54):
I have not, no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:55):
Okay. He has a whole system. So you talked about how as a leader you want people to not take everything you tell them as feedback as I need to do this. So he has a whole set of hashtags that communicate how important this is to him from hashtag FYI to suggestion, to a plea.

Brian Tolkin (00:29:13):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
A plea to you.

Brian Tolkin (00:29:17):
This was actually explained to me. I don't think I've seen the original source, so I'll go back and watch it, but this was explained to me as I'm actually a big fan. I think that's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):
Yeah, just get everyone on the same page. Okay. Maybe one last question here. Who do you try to invite to product reviews? Do you have any frameworks and ways of thinking of who to invite, who not to invite?

Brian Tolkin (00:29:36):
Yeah, good question. We, I would say have oscillated over time, but in general, big subscribers of the best conversations happen when they're relatively small, so try and keep it under 10. Could be wide distribution of the document. The artifacts created are actually really powerful and they're powerful for the whole team to understand. And secret power is they're very powerful for new people who are onboarding to be like, here are the last 20 product reviews, you'll get a pretty good idea of what's going on. But generally the conversation itself try and be relatively tight. We try to keep it under 10.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:15):
And these artifacts, you mean the recordings of the meeting that people can watch or?

Brian Tolkin (00:30:20):
Yeah. Or just the document depends on what the company culture is, whether you want to record it or just have the document either way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:26):
And then is there some specific cadence you operate on? Is it like a weekly product review that people can sign up for? Does every team, how do you like to set this up the cadence?

Brian Tolkin (00:30:35):
Yeah, obviously it scales are with the size of the company. For us right now, what's working well is signup cadence. We have two slots a week that anyone can sign up for as their product area needs it. And then if there's something that we would love to see that we haven't seen in a bit, we do a little bit of all in telling to make sure that the work is generally cycling through on a quarterly basis.

Adjacent topic. I hear you're a big fan of drops to be done, which is okay, so it's a fun recurring topic on this podcast. We've had many people that love it, many people that hate it. I love seeing both sides of it. I love that you find it helpful and you implement it at Opendoor. I'd love to hear just how you actually apply it at Opendoor, what you've learned about how to apply jobs to be done effectively.

Brian Tolkin (00:32:17):
Yeah. I think like all frameworks, the right answer is to pick your set of frameworks, have more tools in your toolbox, and then actually understand when and how to apply them. So we try to avoid being a hammer and everything's a nail. We try to for course the framework if it's not working. But I think what I really like about it is it forces you to put yourself in the customer's shoes. I think in a slightly deeper way and be a little bit more empathetic when I think about building at Opendoor versus say building at Uber or when you are building at Airbnb is we are not... Most people at Opendoor, we don't have homes to sell every week or every month, nor do we buy homes every week or every month. On average in the US is something people do once every seven years.

(00:33:10):
I'm sure the average at Opendoor is something similar, and so it's a little bit harder to be a customer. I took Uber every day. You probably use Airbnb a number of times a year. And so in some sense for some of those companies, you can bill for yourself, you would intuit the job to be done because you're just doing it for yourself. We don't necessarily have that context. And so a framework that forces us to be really thoughtful and intentional about how a customer might perceive our product is really helpful. The other thing that I like about it is the canonical version of it encourages you to think about the context in which the user's operating or the other things outside of your product that they might be going through.

(00:33:59):
And in our case, the home buying or selling journey often is a certainly multi-week, if not multi-month or multi quarter journey with a lot of complexity and a lot of conversations outside of our product. You may be talking to an agent, you may be talking to a friend, you may be driving around the city trying to find a house, and the framework is very flexible and encouraging of saying what is actually the job to be done of this user when they're thinking about our product and what is the context in which they're operating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
I'd love to go one level deeper to talk about how you actually implement it. Do you have templates of, you have a startup project as a blank, I blank, blank, blank? How do you...

Brian Tolkin (00:34:40):
I would say we're medium rigorous on template standardization or adherence. So we do have a template, the standard product review template talks about jobs to be done and has a section for what is the problem statement and what are the jobs to be done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:58):
And this is a doc that when you're coming to a product review, the person running it and coming is filling out this document?

Brian Tolkin (00:35:04):
Correct, pre-filling it up, sorry, pre-filling it out. And again, I think we are not sticklers about always using that template, but I think the beauty of a template is yes, it sets expectations of what you expect, but it's also just easier often for people to be able to work off something. And so yeah, it's part of our product review template and then part of our planning process as well. Because we've used it for a while. I think there's been an internalization of the culture where people will also just start commenting about it or writing about it and saying, hey, what is the job to be done here? Or what is the user trying to do? Which is maybe another colloquial phrase in it. And so, yeah, I think there's a cultural seeping that has happened.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):
From memory, just what is in this template. So what's the phrasing that you try to use for setting up a problem?

Brian Tolkin (00:35:55):
Yeah, yeah. I mean, the specific framing, I would have to go remind myself on the template itself, but generally it looks like context, problem, potential solution, risks, risks/premortal and measurement of success. And then we also try to bucket our product reviews by stage. So you could be in the ideation stage, which might look very different than at the very end of the process. Like, Hey, we're getting ready to ship speak now forever hold your piece. Those two artifacts will also be very different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):
Okay. So it's not as a blank the standard jobs to be done language, it's not exactly how you implement it's more just make sure we're thinking of it what is the problem for the customer? What is the context of their problem?

Brian Tolkin (00:36:47):
Correct. Yeah. Yeah, we're not math living our template.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
Okay, awesome. Any other tips or lessons about just working well with this concept of jobs to be done? Maybe when you come into Opendoor and like, hey everyone, we're going to be thinking this way. Is there anything there that would be useful to people if they're trying to operate this way?

Brian Tolkin (00:37:06):
Recognizing that correctly implementing a framework, any framework, but if you don't in particular, we can talk about takes a little bit of time and getting used to and understanding. And so I don't think you can just like, okay, we're going to make the template and then that makes the content better. That just takes people's content and they wedge it into the template. It's actually the cultural internalization of like, hey, this might be phrased as the job to be done, but is this actually the job to be done? Let's talk about why the customer might be in that situation or not be in that situation. Or I think the job to be done might actually be something else.

(00:37:43):
Or you might say, hey, the job to be done is maybe an early day version would be the job to be done is to get an offer from Opendoor. And it's like, well kind of, but the broader job to be done might be price discovery for the customer. And so you can have a rich conversation where it's like, well, one might be a little bit influenced by our business goals. I don't think you just run around and people are like, yeah, I'm going to sell my house, but my goal is to get an offer from Opendoor. And so that's like, okay, the template might be the same, but it's actually the content that takes a little bit of cultural instantiation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:21):
Got it. And it sounds like people talk from what is the job to be done that feels like a core part of the way you think about it. What is the job to be done? Just that language alone feels really powerful. Is there a resource or a book that you point people to help your team learn about the jobs to be done work? Is there one thing you find useful?

Brian Tolkin (00:38:38):
Not about jobs to be done. I do a lot more pointing people towards internal examples of where I saw other PMs maybe do as well or blogs and stuff. But your blog is a column when we pass around, not about jobs to done, but just about many topics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:56):
I'm flattered. Thank you.

Brian Tolkin (00:38:58):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
I really appreciate that. I was also thinking as you were talking, you're friends with Kayvon and jobs to be done on Twitter was quite the journey for them, traumatic for a lot of people. I think it went very far to the extreme of the-

Brian Tolkin (00:39:11):
Yeah. I think they're more dogmatic about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:13):
Very dramatic. And so I guess it's a lesson here, maybe don't take it that far.

Brian Tolkin (00:39:19):
Yeah. And I think it probably, and I don't know if Kayvon would agree with this, I imagine he would, the generalized version of you pick the right framework for the right job and if you say there's one framework to rule them all and this is the only framework that works and then of course every problem into it, then we chop.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:38):
The way I think about jobs to be done is exactly the way you're describing it where it's just think from the lens of the job to be done for our customers. So for my newsletter, what is the job to be done of my newsletter to help you become better at your job as a product person building product. And that actually ends up being really helpful. And it feels like that's the way you guys think about it at opening.

Brian Tolkin (00:39:57):
Yeah, absolutely. And you're crushing it by the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:00):
Thank you. So are you. You talked about, I'm going to go into another question to deflect your compliment. You mentioned that Uber, there's a million transactions happening every second, it's massive scale. Opendoor is completely different. You have very few very large transactions. Yeah. I'm curious how you do experiments, if you do experiments, do you do A/B tests? What have you learned about just how to think through low sample sizes plus A/B testing?

Brian Tolkin (00:40:29):
Yeah, very hot topic of conversation. We do A/B test. It is obviously the gold standard. And so we do as much as we can. Of A/B testing there are parts of our funnel and flow that have more volume than others. So top of quality testing easier than down funnels, A/B testing purely product or tech features easier than A/B testing processes, operational processes. But you're totally right. We are not doing hundreds of millions of transactions a year. And so experimentation can be more challenging. And so I think one way to think about it is A, acknowledge the problem, which just to say don't, and we've made this mistake many, many times, but don't just force yourself into A/B testing without running the power analysis and say like, hey, are we going to get results? What is the size that will detect and what is the runtime of that experiment?

(00:41:39):
And be honest, is that acceptable? A second lesson here, is there certain experiments that are important enough and it's hard to triangulate signal in any other way that you may say a six-month runtime is an acceptable outcome and we are going to start it in June and we will be smarter for it for 2025 planning and we're going to set it and forget it and we're grateful we did, and that's okay. But the only mistake here is thinking you'll get an answer in a month when you won't, and then pretending you do and then waking up a month later and being like, "Well, it was insignificant and this and that." We could have known that. And then the third thing is, and experimentation is all about increasing your conviction in the problem or the solution. So the generalized version of the statement is, if there are parts of your funnel or flow that are low end and you can't run a canonical A/B test, how might you otherwise increase your conviction in the solution that you're building?

(00:42:47):
And there turns out there are a decent number of other ways to do that. The first best, most obvious is talk to more customers. But there are other statistical techniques that again, aren't as rigorous or good, but may be possible. You may be able to use observational data, you review with diff and diff, you may be able to look at sister cities or twin cities. You may be able to segment by geo, you may be able to reduce your power and say, hey, we're going to run at 80% confidence for all of our experiments instead of this traditional 95% because that's a worthy trade-off. And if we're wrong one more time out of 10, that's okay.

(00:43:28):
You can do a long-term holdout to match your intuition. And so there's a lot of other techniques to hone your intuition. There's a lot of other techniques to build conviction and confidence. And so we try to be very creative on doing that. And then the last bit I would say is if you're not going to get significance, if there's no other techniques at your disposal, then sometimes you just got to trust your intuition and ship it. And if that's what you believe, then that's what you believed and you shouldn't spend time trying to get false precision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):
I want to spend more time on that last point, but real quick, the power analysis you talked about, there's people, don't know, there's calculators out there that you could just plug in, here's how much traffic I'm getting, here's how much of an impact difference I want to see, here's how long it'll take to find out.

Brian Tolkin (00:44:17):
Yep, exactly. Totally. And some of the calculators are great where you can also plug in the traffic and your acceptable runtime and it will tell you the minimum detectable impact and then you can gut check your own intuition. So you can play around with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:31):
Awesome. We'll try to link to one of those in the show notes. So, on the intuition piece, is there anything more there? Just like how you think about when you run the product team, just how you recommend people leverage intuition versus not. Because some companies are like, we're just going to trust the data. I don't really trust your opinion. You don't know this customer exactly. You talked about Opendoor, I'm not buying houses myself, so I don't know how much I can trust my intuition. Just what's your general advice to your product team of how to think about their intuition and when to rely on it versus not?

Brian Tolkin (00:45:06):
So, at Opendoor, for example, I'd say on the relative spectrum, we're quite data-driven. And then it's when we come into this challenge where we say, okay, that is another technique or tool in the toolbox. I think the generalized version of that is customers, products, people can surprise you. And so this happens all the time for people who build products. I'm sure you've got great stories from Airbnb where you saw something, put it out there just was very-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):
All the time.

Brian Tolkin (00:45:36):
All the time. And so I think there's definitely a humility to say if you can, if it's relatively easy to test your assumptions or test your hypotheses. That is always better to gut check yourself. And that takes a little bit of humility to say that, but we've all been wrong plenty of times. But if that's just not on the table, I think the reality is you can't pretend it is. And sometimes you got to use taste and judgment and then you say, okay, what is my conviction level and do I have just medium, low or high conviction? And if I have anything low or medium conviction and it's a decision of consequence, I should talk to more customers, check it with another person and see if their intuition matches. Something that gets me personally to the high bucket category.

(00:46:27):
And then I think the last part, which is some part of experimentation is if you just ship something because it's your intuition or it's where you want to see the product go, do you have a reasonable feedback loop to understand whether or not you are correct? So that could be customer support or ticket volume or feature adoption, whatever the case is, it may not be an output metric in the traditional A/B test, but some more rigorous system that says, hey, I had this hypothesis, we just shipped it for x, y, z constraint reason for red.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:04):
I think that's awesome advice. I agree with everything you're saying. You mentioned this word humility, and it is a good segue to something I want to talk about, which is Zillow. One of the most interesting things that's happened in your space is Zillow basically decided, hey, we're just going to do what Opendoor is doing, they launched it, you're basically frenemies for a while, and then they're like, no, it's not working. Now you partner and now you work with Zillow on this stuff. So are you able to share what went down there with the story of what happened, how it went, and where things are at now?

Brian Tolkin (00:47:36):
Yeah, I mean we do partner with Zillow. Zillow's been a fantastic partner for us and we've really enjoyed a working relationship with them. I think when you think about it, they have tremendous amount of reach and audience and all these online platforms have tremendous reach and audience. And we happen to have a fairly unique selling solution. And so there's a nice, not to use a business school word, but there's a nice synergy so to speak, between a high intended audience who's doing a lot of browsing and searching and discovery and starting their process on one of these online platforms and what we offer, which is transaction services that allow people to actually move particularly on the seller side. And so there's just a pretty nice symbiotic relationship there with the Zillow's and the regimens of the world. And so both of those have been great partners for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):
What do you think Zillow maybe underestimated or didn't get about the space that made it harder than they anticipated? That seems obvious. Of course, let's go down funnel, let's just do it all. And they're like, "Oh, shit, not working." What do you think they didn't get or what do you think they missed?

Brian Tolkin (00:48:58):
I guess continuing on the humility point, I won't necessarily pretend to be in their shoes, but I will say the business is challenging and it's complex from a number of different dimensions. It's not a traditional software only product, but you have to be really good at pricing. You have to be really good at product, you have to be really good at the operations. You have to be really disciplined at risk. You have to be really good in the capital markets. And so you have to put all of these functions together to build a vertically integrated product. And that's the reality. And so that is something that's been in Opendoor's DNA from day one because we started with a vertically integrated product. And so we can't deliver unless we have all of those things. Right? And so I think that's something that continues to help us to this day, is that vertical integration requires all of those pieces coming together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):
That makes a lot of sense, and I think it's a good reminder of there are adjacent markets and businesses that always feel like, "Oh, we could expand to that someday." Such a big opportunity, this business could be so much bigger. And then you realize your business is completely not set up to operate this way. Zillow is very software driven, just I am not going to simplify what they do, but it's a website, very software. And obviously as we talked about Opendoor, a huge operational component. And then as you said, the pricing piece and the debt stuff.

Brian Tolkin (00:50:24):
Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):
Yeah. So I think it's a really good reminder that just when you're taking on something completely different, it may not fit into the way your company operates and partnering makes sense. Anything else there that's interesting to share around the Zillow thing? I guess one is maybe it was just like, I imagine it was very stressful. Zillow's getting into it. "Oh, shit what are we going to do? They got all the traffic." Yeah, anything there?

Brian Tolkin (00:50:46):
Yeah. I mean, it's certainly stressful. I think in general we try to live by whether Zillow or anybody else being competition aware, but not necessarily competition focused. And the reality is vast, vast in our space. A vast majority of people still move the traditional way. And so this isn't something where it's like the size of the prize isn't particularly large enough short or anything like that. The reality is it's the largest asset classroom in the United States, and if we just stay super focused on, hey, who are the customers that we serve really well that we talk to every day, there's a little bit of confidence that comes from being able to stay focused on that regardless of the competitive environment, again, because it's not like the market is fully saturated.

(00:51:40):
This is the same thing back in the Uber days as well. It's like transportation is almost infinitely large. And so, yes, it feels like there's heated competition between Uber and Lester or whatever back in the day, but the reality is there's plenty of trips that happens and people need to get around sitting in plenty of different ways. That's neither Uber and more Lyft. And staying focused on how you can develop for your customer, I think is the best way to focus.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:11):
There's a podcast that will come out before this episode with Jeff Weinstein from Stripe who's building Stripe Atlas. They had a similar experience with AngelList launched a direct competitor to Atlas, and then they realized Atlas is so much better. Forget it. We're just going to send everyone to Atlas.

Brian Tolkin (00:52:29):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:30):
Yes. And I think it's the same exact lesson that if you just stay focused on jobs to be done, let's say, of what is the job to be done and do the best possible job, and knowing that the market is much bigger, that you're not really competing with someone else, another company, it's the default behavior in your case. It's like people are just buying their house the old-fashioned way. That's the actual competition.

Brian Tolkin (00:52:51):
Exactly. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:53):
Yeah. Okay. So, along these lines, something else I've heard that you're very good at is staying very calm under pressure and staying very levelheaded when things are really crazy. This is something that a lot of people are not good at, especially leaders. They stress everyone out things. You go crazy, they don't create a good vibe. And then two, something people want to get better. Leaders and non-leader are like any lessons, anything you've learned about just how to develop this skill?

Brian Tolkin (00:53:18):
I think part of this may have been sharpened in the early days of Uber. Everything felt like a fire drill all the time. So the only way to operate, but I think you almost hit the nail on the head in the question, which is a little bit of an intellectual answer of when you reflect the stress onto your teams, everybody tenses up and tightens up. And so it counterintuitively doesn't produce better outcomes. And so I think the other reality to remind ourselves, and these are a bunch of mantras that just are helpful in these moments, is you're never as good as you think you are. You're never as bad as you think you are. And so that more even keeled demeanor, I think allows you to have a clearer head when you're operating under the pressure and to think more clearly.

(00:54:14):
I think one of the maybe least helpful answers, but unfortunately, the reality is you got to be in some stressful situations to also have the perspective that cycles past the things past. And that remaining calm is what matters. And so maybe the advice there is reflecting on one of these situations happen, exposing yourself to them, not running from them and then learning from them so that the next time it comes around you can say, Hey, I've been here before. I've slept on the floor in China before launching uberPOOL and thinking we're going to miss a launch deadline. And what were the tools in my toolbox and my toolkit that showed me that in terms of getting it done or not, and what were the lessons?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:06):
I love that. So part of it is just go through this experience many times and you'll start to realize, okay, it's not actually going to be as bad as people may think. You mentioned this toolkit instead of tools. Is there anything else there that you come back to that ends up being helpful? You mentioned this mantra of it's never as bad as people think it is, it is never great as people think it is.

Brian Tolkin (00:55:23):
Yeah, I mean, I think exposing yourself to other people's stories or however you may learn is really, really helpful. So again, whether it's your podcast or books or biographies or one of the podcasts that I love is Founders Podcast, which talks about historical famous entrepreneurs. And obviously these are elevating very famous people already, but there's a lot to learn from a lot of these stories as well and understanding that the journey in pack is nonlinear, it never is for anybody. And so I think being able to expose yourself to other stories that even may if you don't have those personal experiences and then understanding how others navigate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:11):
Got it. So just hearing of other people's crazy experiences and building on this muscle of like, okay, they've gone through crazy stuff, things work out.

Brian Tolkin (00:56:18):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):
We'll make it through. Okay. I have this note here that I think either someone mentioned about you or you may have mentioned that product is finding the kernel of truth in a sea of ambiguity and signals. Does that mean anything to you?

Brian Tolkin (00:56:33):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think in most organizations and to do the job effectively, you're going to get signals from everywhere and good ideas come from everywhere. It may be your CS team or CX team. It may be a customer directly. It may be a conversation you had. It may be a YouTube video you watched that sparked an idea. It may be feedback from an executive, it may be whatever. You went out and did a field visit. You are going to get a lot of inputs around what people think about your product, what people think you should do next. And I think that the core job is to understand what really matters, right? What is noise? What is a good idea, what is a suggestion and what is back to the jobs to be done for what is really going to move the customer forward?

(00:57:24):
And unfortunately that means saying no to maybe what sounds like some good ideas along the way, but if you can really figure out this is really what matters, that's the core part of the job. It dovetails even back to our earlier conversation. In the early days of building tech and ops companies is where's the tech leverage? Same question, where's the kernel of what really matters that tech can uniquely solve? And let's go do that and be comfortable with other fires maybe burning. That's what really, really, really matters. It's a hard discipline.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
I love that. If there's not an example, that's totally fine, but when you talk about this finding this kernel where tech could be highly leveraged, is there any example that comes to mind of that working out really well?

Brian Tolkin (00:58:13):
I mean, I think back in the Uber days, I think it was like, hey, we're not going to build sophisticated tooling infrastructure. We're not going to build a centralized growth team. We're not going to build any of that. Because if you think about the early Uber network from the simplest form, you've got a rider and a driver and you need to connect them, price the transaction and issue some receipts probably and collect payment. So it's like, okay, do we do that really well? And until we do that really well, all the other stuff is noise. It's immaterial how efficiently we answer support tickets. That's not critical. And so now it's super critical, but in the early days it's not that critical. And even the customer acquisition costs may not be super critical, in this case it's growing rapidly on the things. And so pouring fuel on the fire may not be super efficient there.

(00:59:13):
So I think that's a very good generalized example. One other tip that maybe is helpful that I frankly constantly work on and try to get better at is all these ideas and feedback that comes from everywhere, make sure it's written down for a number of reasons. One, you can then go reference it, but two, part of the job is making sure the people who present those ideas are heard and respected and know that it's at least somewhere where it was considered. And then you can look at it all and say, okay, but what actually really, really, really, really matters here? And yeah, that's another tip.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:55):
When you say written down, is there tools you find really helpful here? Is it just put it in a big doc that we're keeping? Is there anything you find to actually operationalize that?

Brian Tolkin (01:00:03):
I've seen different companies do it differently, but wherever you tend to try and keep a backlog, whether that's a Google sheet or your actual backlog in Jira, whatever you use, but at least it feels like, okay, the context was captured, and the idea is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:19):
Awesome. Okay. I'm going to take us to a recurring segment on this podcast called Failure Corner.

Brian Tolkin (01:00:25):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:26):
Is there a story you can share of a time you failed in your career had a big failure, and how that experience made you better?

Brian Tolkin (01:00:35):
We can talk about the very early days of uberPOOL, and the first launch, if you will in San Francisco. So, carpooling product, multiple riders in a Mercedes car. And we had this idea that it would be effective for commuters, this was very, very early days. And so part of the launch was, okay, we're going to beta it with just some popular commuting corridors with specific companies or maybe the marina to Google or whatever and try and match people according to what their companies and that's how we'll drive liquidity. And we very quickly realized that back to what the kernel of truth is here is liquidity is the only thing that matters. And there just wasn't enough. There was never going to be enough to do this company based thing. That wasn't the strategy that was going towards from us. And so the reason I don't know if it's a full failure is maybe this is true all failures, you learn from it, you pivot and you go on to the next thing.

(01:01:52):
And obviously we did that and then spent a lot of our time and effort trying to say, okay, what are the bounds of liquidity and driving liquidity that we can do to understand what the most important or what the limits of the product are. So as an example, we launched and maybe people in San Francisco. Remember this $5 anywhere in San Francisco, we work for promotion, which is obviously a great deal, obviously costs a lot of money, but the whole idea here is like, oh, okay, if liquidity is what really matters, if we were to juice that and really drive liquidity, how high can our metrics get? And then we can go chase more sustainable ways to do that. But it was a interesting fail case from launching and learning to say, hey, this initial strategy just isn't going to work, we got to go. And any part of it was a hedging strategy where with a small audience and there'll be a beta population, it's like, well, this one you just got to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
I think a lesson there is also don't overthink it, don't try to get too cute. Just like we're trying to make a perfect beta test versus realizing, okay, we just need a lot more people in it. Also, your $5 promotion made me think of the early promotions of the ice cream and the bunnies delivery and all that stuff.

Brian Tolkin (01:03:13):
Yeah. That was by the way, a example of fully distributed, the benefit of having those early Petri dishes. Someone a local marketing manager like, Hey, this would be fun. Yeah, that would be really fun. The platform can support it. And those promotions were fantastic. And it started out, I can't remember if the first one was ice cream or puppies, I think it was ice cream. But yeah, branched into all sorts of stuff. Boats, ice cream, puppies, kittens, I think, and all credit goes to local ideas of inspiration just being focused on trying to grow within.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:56):
I love that we've circled back to the beginning of our conversation, product and ops working together, the benefits of both. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any last nuggets of wisdom that you think might be useful to people when they're trying to build product companies teams?

Brian Tolkin (01:04:13):
This was great. We covered quite a bit of ground. I think the only, I don't know if this is a generalized wisdom, but something I've been thinking about as my career has progressed a little bit, especially building out proper organizations, especially as more tools come online, it's very clear that there's different types of PMs and we spent a lot of time talking about once we can operate in the physical and the digital or the product and operations worlds. But even within that, there's more technical PMs who grew up in minute engineering discipline. There are people who came from ops and there are people who came from design and grew up in a more user experience background.

(01:05:01):
And one thing that I've been moved on as is build out the team is thinking similar to a product roadmap is it's not really about is this person good or bad or whatever, it's is this person's skillset and context to the problem that is really needed. And so back to that conversation on, hey, where do we get tech leverage? It's like, Hey, is this person who has this unique skillset as a PM for this problem type? I don't know if that's helpful, but it's something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about, especially this view job posting niche view product manager. Or it's actually like, well, how can we be a little bit more thoughtful about what the actual skillset needs off this type of team?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:47):
Awesome. It's like a person product fit.

Brian Tolkin (01:05:50):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):
And I think it's because a lot of companies hire generalists and they're just like, we'll hire someone smart, ambitious, and with experience and general experience and then we'll put them on different things. So I think these are two different philosophies and it probably makes a lot of sense for an Opendoor with very unique type of business, with very specific skills that are necessary to be really good there. Okay, amazing. Brian, with this, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Brian Tolkin (01:06:16):
Let's do it. Can't wait.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:17):
Let's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Brian Tolkin (01:06:23):
Shoe dog, Black Swan, Design of Everyday Things, and for a fun one, Shawn Theron.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):
Amazing. Four books for the price of two to three. I love it.

Brian Tolkin (01:06:40):
Apologies. I'll stick to the rules.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:42):
No, no, there's no rules. There are no rules.

Brian Tolkin (01:06:45):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Brian Tolkin (01:06:50):
I like the sports docu ones on Netflix, so Full Swing, Drive to Survive, Break Points, tennis, golf, F1, all of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:02):
And wasn't there that Nike documentary recently with Ben Affleck?

Brian Tolkin (01:07:05):
There is, which I have not seen. So if it's good, I don't know if that's a recommendation or just an acknowledgement.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):
It's worth watching. If you like Shoe Dog, I feel like you'd enjoy it. It was entertaining Michael Jordan, things like that. Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love?

Brian Tolkin (01:07:24):
So we just got a puppy and we are about to have our first child. And so all of my purchases recently are puppies and children focused. My buddy gifted us the Phi collar for our dog, and so we've been really enjoying that. Another one as I'm getting busier for news and stuff is Particle, which is a great news aggravation tool, AI news tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:54):
Cavan's wife's business. I am a huge fan, actually I think it just came out of beta and now it's like a full app that anyone can download. I just actually installed it yesterday again and I love it. I get these pushes every few... I don't know, it's like a couple of times a day of just like, here's what's happening. Also, congratulations I should have said on your pending child.

Brian Tolkin (01:08:16):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:17):
Lucky for you. I have a newsletter post with all the products you should buy, it's called New Parent Gift Guide for Product Managers.

Brian Tolkin (01:08:24):
Love it. I will definitely probably buy all of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):
If you don't already have them all. And now everyone's probably sending you their spreadsheets of all their favorite stuff there.

Brian Tolkin (01:08:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with people either in work or life?

Brian Tolkin (01:08:41):
Well, mostly just stay curious.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:44):
Stay curious. I love it. Two more questions. Who has most influenced you in the course of your career?

Brian Tolkin (01:08:54):
One of the people who inspired me very early on in my product journey. I've been fortunate to have a number of very good mentors and obviously we talked about earlier while I was founders of books or me a lot from other people's journey. But one person who was personally important to me early in my product journey and very supportive of this guy named Jeff Holden, who was the chief product officer at Uber back in the day, and is like a young PM transferring into product really took me under his wing. And I think I'm forever grateful for that, for Jeff, for helping grow my career, but also try to pay it forward a little bit in terms of people who are going in the career. That was really meaningful for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:42):
Last question. I hear that your interview at Uber was pretty wild. Can you tell that story?

Brian Tolkin (01:09:48):
Yeah, I can. So, long story short, I was starting a company my senior spring before graduation and we had to go our separate ways. So I hadn't done traditional recruiting ever. And my buddy called me up and was like, "Hey, we're looking for smart, hardworking people at this Uber thing. Are you interested?" And quick side note, I had actually done some very early diligence work on these taxi apps back in 2011, looking at the time was Uber Cab and Cabilis and Taxi Manage can probably names nothing these days. And so I knew what Uber was and so I said, "Yeah, sure, I would love to." And so I had the first round of interview went well, and they said, great. And at that stage is come on onsite, the full enchilada one works, and this was post-graduation and was helping out some companies but didn't have a full-time job.

(01:10:51):
So I said, hey, I'm pretty flexible. How about next Tuesday? I said, great. So we scheduled it and then on Friday or Saturday or over the weekend I looked, I'm like, oh, Tuesday's, July 4th. I scheduled my interview for July 4th. And so I called my buddy and I'm like, hey, I am so sorry. I don't want to make people in on July 4th. Should I cancel? Should I reach out? Everyone's accepted. Whatever you do, do not cancel your interview. Like, okay, I'll be there on July 4th. And so I went in to the office on July 4th and there was a very small handful of people there. It was actually launching that day, was launching Uber's second ever product type, which was Uber SUV. And I had this, I think it was probably five hour gauntlet interview on July 4th from noon to five and missed my July 4th barbecue. And it was quite the experience, but I think maybe set the stage for some of the early days chaos. I'm very glad I didn't cancel the interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:58):
And was Travis involved in that interview or is it just-

Brian Tolkin (01:11:59):
Travis was involved in the interview. She was one of the... I think there were four or five people, and the two who were generally guiding my interview process and Travis and one other person starting that day. And part of the gauntlet interview was a simulation of the job, if you will. And so some of that was building some novels on the computers and some of it was writing potential emails to drivers and if she had the driver come in and you did chat, so I was in this room by myself typing away on the first part, which was building the model. And I hear him knock on the door and Travis comes in and he just sits down and says, "Hi, I'm Travis." I don't know who you are, but I'm Brian, and we have a 45-minute chat, or maybe it's been about half hour, 45 minutes. And clearly I'm not producing the work that I'm supposed to of the interview.

(01:12:59):
I'm supposed to be building this model. I'm supposed to email it back to the person who sent it to me. Clearly I've done nothing chatting with the CEO. And I hear a knock on the door and the door opens and the person sees that I'm talking to Travis, "Oh, continue, continue" and it was very good. Also, pretty intense conversation with Travis that definitely set the expectations working there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:24):
And clearly worked out. And Travis was happy. Is what-

Brian Tolkin (01:13:28):
I hope so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):
... I imagine.

Brian Tolkin (01:13:29):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
Amazing. Brian, thank you so much for being here. We went through everything that I was hoping to get through. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, and is there anything you want them to check out that you might be up to? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Brian Tolkin (01:13:44):
Super kind. They can find me online on Twitter, LinkedIn, both just Brian Tolkin, my name. In terms of being useful, if you have a home to sell, feel free to go on to Opendoor. More importantly, if you have feedback on the product, but would love to hear it. Otherwise, any feedback on what people liked or would love to learn more about from what we chatted about would be super great. So I'd love to hear from you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:09):
Brian, thank you so much for being here.

Brian Tolkin (01:14:12):
Lenny, I really appreciate it. This was great. Bye everyone.

# Inside Canva: Coaches not managers, giving away your Legos, and embracing AI | Cameron Adams

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Canva is bigger than Figma and Miro and Webflow combined. You guys are generating $2.3 billion in ARR and you're profitable. You're also growing 60% year over year and it's accelerating.

Cameron Adams (00:00:12):
I run everyone through the culture of Canva. One of those sections is on giving away your Lego, finding joy in the other things of building a team, passing on your experience, helping other people do great writing or great product building or great engineering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
When is this coaching concept? I've never heard of this.

Cameron Adams (00:00:27):
We don't really have managers, but everyone at Canva has a coach. They're constantly working with you to look at your skills, but also when it might be time to move on to the next level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
I'm curious just how you think about product management.

Cameron Adams (00:00:39):
I didn't want to do product management like they did at Google, and that's because of the different cultures. I have seen product managers at other companies who are very independent of teams and that seems very weird to me. For us, product managers are really connected.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
It feels like Canva has just been this non-stop up into the right all win, all success. In reality, that's never actually the case.

Cameron Adams (00:00:56):
How many failure stories do you want? We got plenty.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Cameron Adams. Cameron is the co-founder and chief product officer at Canva, which is a truly incredible business and company. At the top of the episode, I share a bunch of stats. They'll probably surprise you about the scale that Canva has reached these days.

(00:01:19):
In our conversation, we cover a ton of ground including how Canva stays product obsessed, their freemium strategy, lessons about building MVPs, how Cam and the product team think about AI within their product, also peek into their unique team culture, their SEO and growth strategy, and also peek into some of the stuff they just launched.

(00:01:37):
This episode is for anyone building or growing a product or company, and I guarantee by the end of this conversation, you'll be as blown away with Canva as I am. With that, I bring you Cameron Adams. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

(00:02:01):
Cameron, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Cameron Adams (00:02:04):
It is so great to be here, Lenny. I'm very excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:07):
I'm even more excited. I have at least a billion questions for you. I'm hoping I get through at least half a billion. There's so much I want to talk to you about, but I want to start with a warm and fuzzy question. Do you ever just take a moment to reflect on the insane success of this business that you've built? And before you answer that, I'm going to share some stats about Canva that I think are going to blow people's minds. So think about the answer.

(00:02:30):
So I was researching Canva, all of this was just... I didn't know any of this actually, and I think it'll surprise a lot of people just the scale that Canva has reached at this point. Okay. So Canva is bigger than Figma and Miro and Webflow combined both in terms of valuation and in terms of revenue. You guys are generating $2.3 billion in ARR per year and you're profitable. You've been profitable for about seven years at this point. You're also growing 60% year over year and it's accelerating, faster than last year. I think this is all quite unheard of at this scale. Do you ever just reflect back on this and, like, "Okay, I've done well."?

Cameron Adams (00:03:11):
When you say it all like that, it sounds pretty amazing. I don't think every day you're cognizant of that growth and that achievement, but there are particular moments where you get to really reflect, and for me, it's most of the time when we bring the team together. Obviously now we're in a pretty virtual world, hybrid in some best cases. But when the team all get together and we celebrate is when we finally have those moments where you get to step out of yourself, look at this huge sea of people and realize what you've achieved together.

(00:03:48):
Probably the most recent moment we got to do that was for our 10th birthday last year. So Canva is largely centered in Australia. We've got lots of offices around the world, but we had a big birthday celebration in Sydney right on the harbor there in front of the water and we had thousands of people there, and we just got to look back on everything we've achieved over the previous 10 years, and that was the pretty amazing moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:11):
What about just personally, you basically went from a designer on Google Wave to a co-founder of one of the most generational successful startups in the past decade. How does that feel?

Cameron Adams (00:04:24):
I still think I'm constantly growing, I'm constantly learning stuff. I don't feel like I've achieved a ceiling or being a massive smash hit. We're always changing how we're doing things. We're always doing things we've never done before and we feel totally like a fish out of water. So yeah, I've achieved a few things personally, but I still feel like there's so much more to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):
That sounds right. I want to talk about the flip side from the outside, like I described, it feels like Canva has just been this non-stop up into the right all win, all success, just killing it all the time. In reality, that's never actually the case. It's often really helpful for people to hear a story of, okay, there's actually this moment of this may be all falling apart or a struggle for yourself. Is there a moment that comes to mind of just like, "Oh, man, this was really scary and hard for me."?

Cameron Adams (00:05:17):
I think there's probably a few different stories that would resonate with your audience because there's like business kind of stories of how the actual company's tracking. There's product stories of stuff we launched that didn't go anywhere. There's team stories where you're dealing with people and all the different quirks that entails. I think I'll choose a business story. There was a moment around our 100 million valuation mark where we were putting together around... We had a lot of existing investors who were really keen to invest. This is probably our third or our fourth round by this stage, and it was all looking good. There was a particular investor who was really to lead out. We were fine with that. They were doing due diligence, got to the stage where every other investor in the round had signed on. They were super excited. They'd wired the money into our bank accounts already. They'd signed all the long docs but lead investor.

(00:06:15):
And about two days before they were due to sign and get all the money into our account, they came back and said, "Look, business is going great, but essentially we think we can get a better deal, so we're going to cut your valuation by 50%." It was a huge surprise and totally screwed up the entire round. All the other investors were like, "What the hell are you doing?" My co-founders, Mel and Cliff, pretty much jumped on a plane that night to go to Silicon Valley, rallied around a whole bunch of other investors, found a new lead investor, took them about a week. This was the week right before Christmas. It was incredibly stressful, incredibly tumultuous.

(00:07:05):
We eventually came out of it better. We actually got better terms on the deal that we came up with. That investor has fallen to the wayside now and it was a real learning moment for us in terms of how to approach fundraising and also how to be totally independent, and that's one of the reasons why we've focused on profitability for so long now. We've been profitable to spend the seven years and one of the reasons is that we never want to be put in the situation where we have to go to someone for money to ensure the survival of the business, and being profitable means that we never have to do that. We can always do it on our own terms and in our own time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:49):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making a fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.

(00:08:11):
Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.

(00:10:01):
Something that I've heard from one of your investors actually will not be named is that at your board meetings, you have one slide on the financials of the business and then the rest of the deck is product updates, the roadmap. I think this is very rare, especially for companies at your stage that become really focused on financials in the business from the CFO perspective and a lot of founders lose sight of the product. Can you just talk about this element of how you all think about the product that's so central to the business?

Cameron Adams (00:10:32):
I think one key thing is that we don't know it's very rare. We approach a board meeting just like we do anything, we craft the experience about how we think it should be and how we think it's going to be useful. So just like our board meetings or our product meetings or the way that we do launches, we have shaped that in the image that we want it to be and in the way that we think it's going to be most effective. We've always been an incredibly product-led company. We always think first and foremost about the product. That was the whole genesis of Canva itself, having a product that we thought people would love to use and desperately needed to get out into the world and that's the lens that we approach everything through.

(00:11:13):
In terms of board meetings, I think it's been very helpful that our financials and our growth have been amazing for so many years that we don't need to focus on it and we can just have that one slide with the graph going up and to the right. We've also attracted investors who believe in us and who understand that us driving product and getting as much product value out to our customers is probably the most important thing we can be doing. So that's why the board meetings do focus on that because what we are launching in the product, what's ahead is really determining the success of the company. Obviously, financials are important and you can do a bunch of lever pulling and thinking about margins and all that kind of stuff, but product is at the end of the day the most important thing to Canva and the thing that's going to help us stand out and continue to have success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):
I really like this point you made about how you didn't know any better almost, and it reminds me of something else I heard about Canva. It took you guys a long time to hire outside execs. Almost all your leaders are homegrown and it took you a long time to even hire outside of Australia. Its even higher in the US. Can you just talk about why that's been so important and just the impact that has come out of hiring people internally and helping people be promoted internally?

Cameron Adams (00:12:26):
One thing really focused on is team and culture. I think you can probably bring in the world's best person at X, Y, and Z, but if they're not fitting into your team and understanding your culture and have the same passion and vision that you do, they're not going to succeed. So it's super important that we have people along with us for the ride and that might mean everyone at Canva is awesome. They mightn't be the number one person in the world for that particular thing, but they get more done than the number one person could because they've built that trust and that safety with their team. They know how to communicate their ideas, they know how to bring other people along with them and lay out a vision in the way that we understand it at Canva, and that is a critical thing to building a great company, I think, is having that alignment across everyone, across your product teams, across your marketing teams, across your customer happiness.

(00:13:21):
They all need to be aligned and we all need to be rowing in the same direction. We have brought in leaders, and some of them have been incredibly successful. We have brought in leaders, and they've exited the company after a few months just because there wasn't that fit and they didn't manage to figure out or understand what Canva was and how to work within this big ecosystem. Now we've got 4,500 employees now and it's not just a matter of you coming in and bringing all your ideas. You also need to work together with all the other leaders that we have and the team that's surrounding you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:56):
As a lens into what is important. Canva, when you say that they didn't understand what Canva is, what's something that doesn't click for people a lot of times that forces them to be exited potentially? What is it that's so maybe unique or important to the way you all think about stuff?

Cameron Adams (00:14:12):
I have this theory that the type of product you're building very much influences the way that you think, and this stemmed out of a chat I was having with one of the product leaders at Spotify. And they said that at Spotify they do an incredible amount of talking about problems. They'll have a meeting, they'll talk about this new product feature and they'll just hash it out through conversation. And I imagined that that was because Spotify is a very auditory product. Everyone there thinks about music, sound, podcasts, that is their mindset. At Canva, we're all about visual communications. It's pitch decks, it's social media posts, it's video, it's t-shirts that you can make, and that's how we think about things in a very visual manner.

(00:15:01):
So one of the things that's very particular about Canva is really setting visions. And I'm in visions, not just in the sense of looking forward two, three years, but also visions in the very visual sense. We need to be able to see it. We need mock-ups. We need prototypes. You need to get that idea out of your head and present it to someone in a visual form that helps you talk about and communicate about it. That's one aspect of why some people I think don't land on their feet at Canva because they aren't necessarily visual thinkers and they don't end up communicating what they want to do in a visual way to the rest of people at Canva.

(00:15:38):
Another way is that the way that we've grown, the way that we've built product has been quite idiosyncratic over the years. And as I said, we've learned so much just through doing and established our own processes. And I think in any system, if someone comes up from the outside with preconceived notions or this idea that they're an expert and tries to bring that in, it's going to be rejected. So you really need to work together and I think the advice that I can give to people coming to Canva is just listen for a couple of months, figure out what is really working at Canva and why it works before you try and change it. We're very open to change and to new ideas, but just coming in wholesale and totally changing the process, just because that's what you've done somewhere else isn't going to get you the most level of success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:31):
That makes so much sense. We're talking about cultural elements and so I have one more question around culture. I saw a video interview you did once about how you love this concept of giving away your Legos, that's part of your culture and the culture at Canva broadly potentially, and this was originally popularized by Molly Graham in this first round review article. That's something you still believe in and if so, can you just describe that concept briefly because a lot of people haven't actually heard about this?

Cameron Adams (00:17:00):
Yeah, Molly wrote a great article, which I actually refer everyone who joins Canva to in the cultural onboarding session, which I give them. So I run everyone through the culture at Canva and what they can expect over the next few years as they work here, and one of those sections is on giving away your Lego, and it's really important to us because part of being in a startup is scaling, when you're scaling from zero users to a million to a hundred million, and when you're scaling from three founders to 10 employees to 100 employees to 4,000 employees. You're scaling everything from the product to the internal processes you have, the finance team paying people how you deal with user feedback. Everything's just constantly growing, growing, growing. And I think this is slightly different to a traditional job where you get good at the thing that you always do and you try and turn that into a process that just continually works all the time.

(00:17:58):
As a startup, you just have to be changing and we want people who are flexible, you can bring new ideas, you can go to that next level. You can think about not just a million people, but 10 million people, 100 million people, a billion people using the product, and to constantly ratchet up that multiplier, you need to change yourself, which means that you probably need to give away some of the stuff that you're doing now in order to get to that next level. If you're the first email copywriter at Canva, you can get away from writing all the emails for the first year maybe, but when you're writing emails for 100 million people in 190 different countries, in 100 different languages, all at different stages of their journey through using Canva from beginners to intermediates to experts, that just massively multiplies the complexity of the job that you have to do. And if you're trying to write every single one of those emails, you have no chance of scaling.

(00:18:56):
So you need to think about who you're going to bring in to help you, what systems you're going to introduce, what are the processes needed to get 100 different languages translated every time you send out an email and that requires you to hand off that stuff. You need to maybe stop writing every single email, give that to someone else, be comfortable with doing that because you often build up a lot of self-identity and doing that and you get a lot of joy out of it. That's why you're a writer in the first place. But finding joy in the other things of building a team, passing on your experience, helping other people do great writing or great product building or great engineering is really what giving away your Lego is about. And we still encourage everyone to do that, to think about those moments where they need to level up in their impact, how they can bring their team along with them, how they can pass on their experience and help everyone really have a tremendous impact with the skills that they have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:51):
I think a lot of people and a lot of companies struggle with this idea, and I'm curious if there's something you've learned about how to actually implement this. Is it just like, "Hey, go read this article and then I might bring it up sometimes when things are changing and there's a reorg."? Or is there anything even deeper of just this is a cultural element of we are constantly giving up our Lego's giving things that we own?

Cameron Adams (00:20:10):
Probably the deeper thing I think is giving people opportunity so you can talk about growth than just say, "Please grow." That's not going to be terribly effective, but giving them the opportunity and the support to do so is super important. We have a system we call coaching at Canva where you have a coach and they're constantly working with you to look at your skills, how you can improve each of those individual skills, but also what it is that you're actually doing and when it might be the time to move on to the next level. Say you are just doing a product role in this particular product and now you need to be a coach of other product managers and help build products. Understanding those pivot points is really important and our coaches help everyone at Canva. Everyone at Canva has a coach that is constantly thinking about this aspect of their personal growth.

(00:21:00):
And finding those opportunities where you can push someone to do something that they haven't done before or to expand upon an idea that they've had and give them ownership of that idea is super important. So when people do come to us with an amazing product idea or a feature that they want to build or an entire team that they think should be spun up, we really listen to them, and if it makes sense, we say, "Go and do that. Go and build that part of the product, grab a couple of people and start building video at Canva. Do that thing that you're talking about." And I think if you give them the opportunity and a little push to go beyond what they think they're comfortable with right now, that is the best way to drive growth in your team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:44):
Okay. There's two things I want to follow up on there. One is this coaching concept. I've never heard of this. So how does that work? Do they have a manager and they have coach, and who is this coach?

Cameron Adams (00:21:54):
We don't really have managers. So your coach is the person who thinks about you in a specialty sense. So we have specialties, engineering, product design, we got tens of different specialties across Canva, and your coach really helps.. Your coach is a similar specialty leads, so if you're a product manager, they're a product manager, so they know the skills that you have to use. They know the trajectory that you could possibly grow into. They know the structures that are around Canva that you could slot into when you want to go to the next level. And your coach constantly checks in with you, has sessions, might help you with the strategy doc, might have a one-on-one with you. They just constantly thinking about those ways that you can grow and improve at Canva.

(00:22:42):
And then we have probably more of a, I would say, collegiate managerial circle of colleagues who help you who do 360 feedback, all that kind of stuff. So that's the structure that we've arrived on and it's worked pretty well for us and it was driven actually by a formative coaching experience that we had as founders quite a few years ago from an external coach and we decided to bring that into Canva as a whole philosophy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:10):
And these coaches, are they professional coaches or they're people in the company that are like, "I will be a coach for this function."?

Cameron Adams (00:23:15):
They're people in the company. So we've got probably close to 800 or 1,000 coaches now at Canva.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):
Wow.

Cameron Adams (00:23:23):
We do have very specific coaches who are just coaches and they can drop into any situation. They're not product managers, they're not designers, but they're relatively few. I think, we've got probably five of those type of coaches and they just work in very special situations, but what we're focused on is enabling the broader circle of coaches, so those 800 people to understand what it is to be a coach and have the skills of coaching. So we focus a lot on teaching them the skills of coaching, how to build a growth mindset in their coaches, all the skills that you need. So yeah, it's a massive part of Canva.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):
And so there's a product management coach and this person helps all the PMs become better at the craft of product management.

Cameron Adams (00:24:09):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
Wow, so interesting. Okay, and then the performance review piece, how does that work?

Cameron Adams (00:24:13):
Yeah. So your coach feeds into that, but we also do 360 feedback from all the people that you work with and we do that on regular cycles. As with everything at Canva, the cadence of those cycles has changed over the years, but now we do that every six months.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:29):
We talked about product for a little bit. I want to spend a little time on product management. I'm curious just how you think about product management. There's this constant debate across tech companies about the value of PMs. Are we better with more PMs? Are there too many PMs? What do PMs do for you? You're a chief product officer. Where do you find product managers bring the most value to Canva? And then do you just have thought on the future of the field of product management?

Cameron Adams (00:24:54):
I don't know. It's one of those things that I don't want to quantify. I don't want to put it in a box and say this is product management. Because I've worked at a few places now. I've actually only had one real job, which was at Google where I got to experience product managers the Google way. And the way that they do product management is totally different to the way that we do it at Canva, and that's partially by design because I didn't want to do product management like they did at Google, and that's because of the different cultures that they have. Google's a fantastically engineering-driven culture and the way that they think about product management is mostly in the technical sense of like, "Here's a piece of technology, what can that technology do, how do we scale it?" At Canva, we focus a lot on experience and as I said before, it's a very visual experience, so we require a different product management process, but also a different product management mindset.

(00:25:51):
I think we probably did that more from the ground up than a lot of other startups just because Mel and Cliff were a lot less, I think, inculcated into how product management has done other places. I had a bit of experience from Google but was still fairly independent in my thinking, so we almost went back to first principles on how product management should be done, and to be honest, we didn't want to have the term product manager for a long, long time. It wasn't until about year '06 or '07 where we actually had product managers, we decided to cave just because it was easier to explain to people.

(00:26:30):
But it also took us four or five years before we even had another product owner who wasn't us. Part of that was us giving up our Lego, and I think we took a little too long to give up our Lego on that one, but the other part of it was us figuring out exactly what we wanted and how we built product and how to communicate that to someone else and get them to do it in a similar way and work with the teams in the way that we did.

(00:27:00):
For us, product managers are really connectives. They connect the team, ideas, data, a whole bunch of different things, and it's very messy. There's no exact recipe for how to do it, but connecting these disparate areas and moving the team and the technology and our customers to a new place, a new vision is essentially what product managers do, and it's going to involve compromise, it's going to involve changes in the feature scope, it's going to involve timelines of like, "Okay, we can't ship it in May, it's going to have to be July. Let's figure out what we can do with marketing to make that work." This constant movement and connection and reorienting around the constraints that have suddenly arisen in the last week, and that's where we see great product managers operating in Canva.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:56):
You mentioned Mel and Cliff. For folks that don't know, they're the other two co-founders of Canva and they were dating when they were starting Canva, I think it was called Fusion Books back in the day before Canva. Now, they're married. What's it like working with a married couple as the other two co-founders, and is there something they did well that didn't make you feel like this third wheel person that isn't married to them?

Cameron Adams (00:28:22):
It is always tricky working with a couple because they're on it 24/7. When you leave the office and they head home, they're still talking about product, business strategy, all the things. I think they've done a really good job of evolving those ideas overnight through the conversations they have and over dinner and walking, but then bringing that back the next day and being transparent about that and that's super important. If you are working in that kind of dynamic. There are definitely moments where I have missed out on a memo and stuff has rapidly proceeded, and I think I've just gotten used to that and gotten used to catching up really quickly, having a word with them on the side to clarify what the motivation is here and just constantly maintaining that alignment.

(00:29:11):
And I think it happens in any partnership or team. There's moments where there's small alignments, there's more tectonic stuff that happens over months or years, and you need to realign at some stage. I think it happens with friendships, it happens with my wife, it happens with our product teams. There's always these moments where you need to re-communicate things and relay the land of it. And I think we've been great at doing that as co-founders even for the small things and also for the more tectonic things.

(00:30:37):
I'm going to go back to the beginning of Canva. I know that it took you guys a year of building before you launched it, so it took you a year to build the MVP essentially. And I know you have some strong opinions on how long to wait, how MVPs are often way too early. Can you talk about that just why you guys waited so long before launching clearly worked out and so I'm just curious your lessons from that experience.

Cameron Adams (00:30:59):
Yeah, so when we launched or when we were building the Lean Startup book came out, so that was all anyone talked to us about investors, other people building products, trying to give us advice. They were like, "Just get something out the door, as crappy as it is just to get in front of users." I think, for us, the product is the experience and giving people a great experience is an intrinsic part of the product. It's also an intrinsic part of how we've grown. People having a good experience of being enthusiastic about it has been how we've spread the word of Canva and organic word-of-mouth growth was the biggest driver of Canva's growth for many years and probably still is, I think. People just telling someone else to jump on this amazing product, I don't think we would've had that if we just put our pretty crappy product that people didn't have joy in using. Sure, it might've got the job done, but if they weren't excited about using it the next day, then that wasn't a bar that we wanted to hit.

(00:32:08):
So we did hold off on launching the product for a long time and investors did ask us many, many times, "When are you launching? Can you just get this thing out the door?" But we had done enough research, we knew the problem space, we knew what people wanted from the product. Part of that was due to the work that Mel and Cliff did on Fusion Books in a very constrained area. They had looked at school yearbooks, they had built an experience for that, and they had observed what worked didn't work and how they might scale that into a bigger product. It also worked for me who'd worked in a lot of creative tools and built a lot of creative tools over the previous 15 years. So I had a lot of understanding of how people interacted with these systems and the experience that we wanted to build.

(00:32:57):
So we did hold off and the product we launched launched, we obviously weren't happy with. You have to launch something that you're not completely happy with, all the rough edges, but you're releasing it knowing that the rough edges are going to be outweighed by the joyful experience. We still did a ton of user testing, right? It's not like we just launched this thing blind and said, "We hope people like it." We did a ton of user testing. We did a ton of user research into the features that people wanted, and we built that up over time. And one year to me actually seems like short time, a lot of people think it's a long time, but one year was just enough for us to scrape in with an experience that people did truly love when we launched, and particularly the market that we went after when we launched really loved it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:49):
I'm curious just what advice you share with founders when they're asking you how joyous does this first version have to be? How awesome does my MVP need to be? One thread I picked up as you were describing your experiences, you all had deep experience in this space, so you knew what you wanted to build. It wasn't like this dark forest of exploration is like we know what we want generally. Do you have advice you share with founders of how awesome their MVP should be and when it's worth spending a year or two or three building it?

Cameron Adams (00:34:20):
There's a couple of points in there. First is that even today we build for ourselves, and I think this is advice that probably a lot of product people wouldn't give you is that you shouldn't build for yourself, you should build for your customer. But I think we're fortunate that we are our customer and that the problems we experience are the problems that hundreds of millions, billions of people experience. I think that is maybe a fortunate part of just the problem area that we're interested in, but it has enabled us to move really quickly on the product because we can quickly know what's working in the product, whether this feature is useful, whether it's reached that bar of a great experience.

(00:35:03):
So that's one aspect of it and I think that is also about being passionate, you entering an area that you are extremely passionate about. I often hear people are like, "I want to do a tech startup. What is the best area I should focus on to build a product in?" And to me, that is totally the wrong way to go about building a company that you're going to spend the next 10, 20 years in because if you're in an area that you are particularly passionate about but you see the opportunity to make a bit of money or have some external measure of success, that is a terrible way to go about being a founder because you're going to hit these rock bottom dark places and if the passion isn't driving you through that, you're going to have an incredibly hard time getting to the next step. So that's probably the first area I talk about in terms of knowing when a product is amazing.

(00:35:58):
The second one is that it really needs to spark, joy, and delight in people and just pure excitement. It can't just be like, "Oh, yeah, this is a useful tool for me." It needs to light up their eyes. They need to be like, "How do I sign up for this thing tomorrow? How do I get it? How do I pay for it?" And they need to want to talk to other people about it because in the early days of your startup, you don't have marketing dollars, you don't have channels which you can go to immediately get access to a million people. You need to really foster the first people that are going to use your product and they're going to be the ones that are going to spread it and they're going to set the foundations for your growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:41):
Interesting. So piece of advice number one is work on something you really want yourself that you're excited to work on. Two is get it to a place where it lights up people's eyes. They're just so excited with this thing. For that second bar, what was it for Canva? Was it just that it was impossible to do this design in a browser?

Cameron Adams (00:37:00):
It was 2012, 2013 when we launched and visual content was still in its infancy. Instagram had only been out a couple of years. Pinterest was on the rise. People were just getting used to creating visuals and it was hived off to a very select few because to create those visuals you needed to afford some expensive software, know how to use that expensive software, nowhere to go to get fonts and photos and illustrations, know how to put that together into something that looked decent and then ship that off. It was something that only 1% of the world could do and democratizing design, empowering the world to design is Canva's entire mission, and we saw this sweet spot at the time in social media. It wasn't what we set out to go after. We set out to democratize design to bring design to literally everyone in the world and to everything that they're doing.

(00:37:59):
But through the user testing that we did, through the levels of excitement that we saw from different people, social media managers really came to the fore at that time. So we knew that they really fit what we could ship right now. We didn't ship a presentation product or a T-shirt builder in our very first version. We shipped a thing that could make square landscape and portrait graphics and blog post graphics, and that got a particular segment of society excited. We added on all the things afterwards because that was part of vision and ultimately what we wanted to build. But with a team of 10 people in the space of a year, building something that really got social media managers excited was what we could pull off. And that's something we realized in the last six months of that launch year. We didn't quite know who our audience was going to be. We knew it was a tool that anyone could use, but in that last six months of user testing and refining is when we really identified that first target market and we just leant into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):
There's so many things you all nailed early on. One of them is the focus persona/ICP, which is you said social media managers. Just to take the lesson from that, you basically saw that segment getting the most excited about the product and that told you, let's focus on this group. Is that right?

Cameron Adams (00:39:27):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):
And was it like an order magnitude more excited? What do people look for there that tells them, "This is the one."? What did you see there other than just more excitement?

Cameron Adams (00:39:39):
It was just incredibly emotive language, like sheer joy. Particularly coming into the product, we worked a lot on the onboarding process in the last couple of months of launch and that was really pivotal because the product features were there. You could add text, you could add images, you can change the color of things, you can move stuff around the page. It was a simple but powerful product, but there was this thing holding people back from actually using it and understanding what Canva could do for them. And when user tested the onboarding of Canva a ton, actually usertesting.com had just launched them, which really unlocked us because we didn't have to do these big formal labs or anything like that. We could just go online and get results in the space of half an hour. So that was like a pivotal unlock for our product process and that's something we still employ today.

(00:40:39):
And through that, we tailored the onboarding process to get people excited and to understand the deeper goal with Canva and the deeper impact it could let them have. It wasn't just about letting them put a pretty picture on the page, it really unlocked their ideas and let them do things they couldn't do before. And we shaped the onboarding to do that and it resonated the most with social media managers because they had this massive content need that they couldn't really service. And in the first minute of Canva with the right onboarding, it just unlocked the whole realm of productivity and impact that they didn't have before and that's why they got super excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:23):
We talk a lot on this podcast about the power of onboarding and the impact that can have on retention and everything down funnel. Do you remember what the unlock was in terms of and getting more people activated? Is there anything that's something that other people can learn from?

Cameron Adams (00:41:38):
For us, it was taking that first step, particularly with Canva and any I think creative tool. There's a real fear of the blank page. So prior to any onboarding thought from us, we had a blank page. We had a few coach marks that said, "Here's where you do this, here's where you do this." And then they'd be left on this blank page and people would freak out. So what we really focused on was just taking that first step and then the next step and then the next step. And before they knew it, they built a design. And the way that we did that was to encourage a really simple step. So the first one was click on this search box and search for a monkey. It literally said that.

(00:42:18):
Searching for a monkey is something you probably don't do in most tools. So it was a little surprising, which was a good inroad, but it was still super easy. Anyone can type monkey. And then you type that in, it comes up with this whole sway the monkey images, which look hilarious, and just dragging one of those out onto a page is another simple step. And we just got people to walk through that keeping their interest up, keeping the bar of effort quite low, but within three or four steps, they'd built up something that they'd never been able to do before, and it surprised them. The words that we literally got out of years at testing were, I didn't know I could be a designer. And that was what we managed to do through several rounds of refinement on the onboarding process. It is lowering the barriers to entry and also increasing the amount of delight, and I think those two things are what you should be aiming for with your onboarding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:16):
That's an incredible insight. Is there a video of that original onboarding out there or is the current one still similar?

Cameron Adams (00:43:22):
The current one isn't similar. We have constantly gone back to it because it performs really well. We do actually apply the same approach of little steps building up into bigger accomplishments, and that's actually rolled out through our last round of launches for the last couple of years through something we call learn and play. So with every launch that we do now, we think about how to teach people about that feature and how to get them really involved in it. We have a whole series of learn and plays where when we launch AI photo editing, they can try it out right then and there. They've got some great content that they can immediately operate on, and it's a super simple step for them to type in a prompt and see the result of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:05):
I think an interesting and really important takeaway here is you built a very delightful, incredible, innovative product, but it still didn't work until you figured out the onboarding and that you needed to figure out the persona to focus on. All those things end up being incredibly important, it's not just build something amazing and delightful.

Cameron Adams (00:44:25):
Definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):
Staying within this realm of growth, you've grown in large part thanks to this incredibly SEO template strategy. You mentioned in interview there's this guy, Andre that came on early and helped you figure this stuff out. Is that true? And if so, what was the key insight that he had that led to such a great success in terms of growth for you all?

Cameron Adams (00:44:49):
Andre is an amazing guy. He's actually been in and out of Canva three or four times now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):
Keep pulling him back.

Cameron Adams (00:44:56):
Yeah, keep pulling him back. We originally found him, he came from a startup that was going under here in Sydney. We had thought about SEO. We knew it was this thing that you could use, and I think in a couple of our pitch decks, we had SEO as a whole growth channel that we were going to execute upon in order for investors to make a ton of money, but we pretty much knew nothing about it. And it was sitting away in our backlog of things to do in the first couple of years of Canva. And we came across Andre and he just really crystallized what SEO was and how it would actually help us grow. So we brought him on, he rolled out his strategy and it was fantastically effective. It was also incredibly cheap, and it was super easy for us to do ourselves.

(00:45:51):
He set up a whole team of people who looked at people's motivations and the top jobs to be done that Canva could service. He then mapped that through the entire experience of going into Google, typing a search query, getting that search query, seeing that it was a great result, firstly getting to the top result, but then also the experience after they landed on Canva. So if they searched for want to make a Halloween poster, the top Google result would be Canva. They'd click on it, they'd land on the Halloween poster landing page. It would tell them how they were going to do, it show you how the product was going to do that, have a button there that immediately took them into a Halloween poster template, went through a fantastic onboarding of customizing that poster really simply, and then they would hit done, download the image, and they had a fantastic experience and he thought through that whole end-to-end flow from first landing on Google and typing into the search box through to that magic moment where they're like, "Canva just helped me do something amazing and I want to do it again."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:58):
Amazing. Okay. So a few things I'm hearing there. One is figure out the jobs to be done of potential users, figuring out where their search volume, figure out ones you can actually solve for them, like say a Halloween poster, and then think about that experience end to end from search to landing. And obviously, you have to deliver on that promise. You have to actually show them a really cool Halloween poster that they can create, right?

Cameron Adams (00:47:19):
Yeah. Again, it's like product led truly means product led because you can't just SEO the hell out of something that is a terrible experience. So tying that experience at the end of the SEO journey is just as important as the technicalities of SEO itself, and Andre really harnessed the whole spectrum of that to produce the end experience, which ultimately ended up with an active user having a delightful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):
Is there anything else along those lines that was really surprising to you or really, wow, that worked a lot better than I thought because it's probably one of the most well executed, most successful SEO strategies in history. And I'm so curious, just if there's anything else there that's just like, "Oh, wow, that was really effective and I didn't expect that."

Cameron Adams (00:48:05):
There's a ton in the SEO realm that Andre drove that can get quite technical. But I think one of the other pivotal growth moments for us was internationalization. I think as an Australian company, we're fortunate in that Australia isn't a great market to focus on. We've got 25 million people here. It's okay, but it's not sizeable. It's not going to make you a huge success. Whereas probably a startup that starts in the US will tend to focus on the US because it's a huge monetizable market, and you can entirely create a great company that just services the US. But from Australia, we needed to think about the world. And that meant that we very quickly got into internationalization.

(00:48:52):
We started localizing and internationalizing our products three years after launch, which is quite early compared to a lot of other companies. And we tackled it with real vigor. We had a goal of being in five different languages within the first year of localization, and we actually hit eight in that first year. And then we set ourselves a goal of being in 100 different languages the next year. And the internationalization team smashed that goal by the end of 2017. And it has drastically changed Canva's growth trajectory because being in other languages, offering a localized experience, something that people in Brazil or Indonesia or Spain or Poland can authentically feel like they're using a product that's made for them has totally changed who our market is, how quickly we can grow. And the way the product's used internationalizing into Brazilian Portuguese meant that we had to focus a ton more on the Android mobile experience, which was really different for us because we focused a lot on the desktop experience for the first four years.

(00:49:58):
People also in Brazil run entire businesses from their mobile phone and the types of content they're creating to interact with their audience is totally different. So it's actually shaped our product and changed our product trajectory as a result of thinking about internationalization. And it has just fueled tremendous growth. Brazil, India, Indonesia, they're all in our top five markets and they grow way faster than the US does.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:25):
I know you went international in your four, something like that, which is really early for a company. It also makes sense for SEO plus internationalization. Makes tons of sense.

Cameron Adams (00:50:35):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):
It's a lot more surface area. Okay. I'm going to have two more questions. One is around your freemium strategy. Another a thing you all nailed. There's just this, you're both seeing incredible growth and incredible monetization. I'm curious what your philosophy is on what to include in the free plan versus what people should pay for because it's clearly worked out great.

Cameron Adams (00:50:59):
Freemium for us wasn't so much a growth strategy or a monetization strategy as much as it spoke to our core mission of empowering the world to design. We truly want to democratize design, which means we want to get design into the hands of as many people as we can because we think that the world is a better place when more people can create really rich visual content. So freemium just made sense to us because we could get the tool into billions of people's hands and they wouldn't necessarily have to pay for it. And much of the world can't pay for products because they just don't have access to that level of income.

(00:51:36):
So providing that equality was really important to us. But also you need to build a viable business because you can't help the world design if you can't afford to keep the lights on. So freemium just really hit this sweet spot for us between philosophy and business building, so it was always part of our plan since day one. We initially had element sales as our business models. So when we first went to pitch Canva, it was all about create a design. Anything you use in that design will cost you a dollar. So if you dragged in a monkey and you wanted to export that whole design, you'd have to pay a dollar for the money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:14):
Yeah, I've done that many times.

Cameron Adams (00:52:15):
Yes. It was really exciting to investors at the time. It was also really exciting to the content creators who were giving us the monkeys to put into our product. It was a totally new business model. It unlocked, I think, an area that a lot of people were unfamiliar with, which was stock photography. Most people had not paid 100, $500 for photo, and that really held them back from being visual content creators. So it was a really unique innovation for us. And for the first two years of Canva's life, that was how we derived our revenue. It grew pretty well. It was still like, I don't know, 30% month-on-month growth in terms of revenue. But you can do that in the early stages of a startup. It wasn't until we introduced our first subscription product that we saw really hockey stick growth in our revenue. And that was always the plan to launch a subscription product.

(00:53:09):
But as with many things, it was a vision that we didn't quite have meat around the bones. So we knew we wanted to put in a subscription what exactly that subscription would look like. We didn't quite know. And through the first couple of years of Canva, we started noticing what people were asking for, what they would be more likely to pay in a subscription for. And that formed the first few features that became what was then called Canva for Work, which is now called Canva Pro. And we launched our first subscription, I think about three years after we launched the first product, and we just rapidly saw the revenue from the subscription start overtaking the $1 image payments.

(00:53:53):
So much so that three or four years later we made image element payments part of the subscription. And again, that was like a second hockey stick in gross in terms of the revenue from the subscription because all you can eat images inside the Canva Pro subscription with just amazing value add for people. And I don't even know if we get any revenue from image element sales now. It's all about just going into this subscription.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:24):
Amazing. Just hockey stick after hockey sticks. Speaking of another hockey stick, I want to talk about AI.

Cameron Adams (00:54:29):
Oh, a whole hockey team of hockey sticks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:32):
Just need to acquire hockey teams. I want to talk about AI, something on the top of everyone's minds these days. It's another area you guys have nailed. You're doing amazing work with AI. It's providing actual value and business impact. I hear you have an amazing internal AI ops team. Is there anything that you've learned so far that you can share about just how to integrate AI successfully and effectively into a product?

Cameron Adams (00:54:58):
As a technology company, you always just need to be constantly evolving and using the best technology. And when we started that was mobile phones and cloud computing. They were the innovations that came in that really unlocked Canva. AI is the next decade I think of innovation. It's the next pivotal piece of technology that helps you build better products, but it also can't just be the basis for your product. You can't just be a product that's purely built on AI on being a rapper around an LLM or something like that. You still need to think about what it is that people want to do and how you build a product that actually meets that need. It isn't just about slapping a chatbot on something that already existed. It's about deeply thinking about how AI can help them get to that goal even faster. And we view AI as the next way of democratizing design and empowering the world to design, helping more people design, helping more people design quicker, helping more people design quicker with better quality. And that's how we approach every aspect of including AI in the Canva platform.

(00:56:04):
We've had a team of machine learning engineers for probably seven years now. I think their work has become a lot more visual now and more customer facing way back when they were just doing recommendation engines inside our emails and our homepage and suggesting templates to you. But now they get to work with some really cool technology, which lets them produce images for people and create designs and summarize text and translate to a hundred different languages like it's really stuff that you can put directly in front of customers now, and that's super exciting. And over the last couple of years, we've built up more and more visual AI experts inside Canva, and we approach AI inside the product through three pillars.

(00:56:53):
First of these is that we need to build some of our own AI tech, and we focus on building the AI tech that we have the biggest advantage in that we have the most data that we can put into it, the most insights, the most criticality to our product and our business. So we have teams building our own AI models around design and images and that stuff. Second pillar is just finding the world's best AI people to partner with. And there's a whole bunch of stuff that you don't need to internalize in your company. You don't need to create an LLM because it's a commodity thing now. And there's a bunch of providers who can do it way better and have way more resources to do it with than you do. So finding a great partner like OpenAI, and we partnered with RunwayML to do video generation, finding the world's best and bringing them into your product with a great integration, the second pillar.

(00:57:48):
And for us, the third pillar is our app ecosystem. So we're fortunate now we've got 170 million people using the product every single month. We have quite an audience that people want access to. And through our app developer ecosystem, they can build apps which directly integrate with the Canva product to give them access to those hundreds of millions of people when people are quite eager to do that. Now, we've seen huge uptake in that from AI developers who have included stuff in Canva from music generators to virtual avatars that can present your presentation to you to a whole slew of things. And those three pillars have, I think, allowed us to create a really coherent experience and one that still keeps a focus on what people want to do, how to help them reach their big goals in a way that doesn't just push technology in the face in a way that just is part of the experience and is a natural way of getting them to where they want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):
I was also looking at the GPT story of the fifth most popular custom GPT where people can generate logos using it. So maybe that's driving some growth too. I know you wanted to share something that you guys are launching or have launched by the time this episode comes out. Is that true?

Cameron Adams (00:59:08):
Yeah, so we've got a big event in Los Angeles in a couple of months. It's our Canva create, which is an evolution of the season openness that we used to do. So season openers are no longer just inside Canva now. We actually invite our whole community in, and we're going to have probably about 4,000 people in the theater in LA and a couple of million online. And we're really going to be pulling the covers off pretty much the next decade of Canva. We've focused for the first decade of Canva on unlocking individuals and small businesses, giving them the tools that they need to design and to express themselves and create visual content. And as Canva has grown and people have gotten used to creating this stuff, they've invited their teams in, they now collaborate with people on presentations, on Canva videos, on swag T-shirts that they need to make for their event next week.

(01:00:06):
And as more and more people are using Canva together, it's picking up a lot of steam. We've got 95% of the Fortune 500 using Canva. We've got huge teams of thousands of people using Canva. And this has really opened our eyes to not only the enterprise opportunity, but also just the way to redesign the way people work. And that is what the event at the end of May is about. It's really redesigning work for a whole number of different verticals, from marketing to sales to HR to IT to creatives that work inside large teams, large organizations, large enterprises. We've redesigned Canva for this collaborative enterprise age, so we'll be pulling the covers off that alongside work kits, which are a whole verticalized experiences for people inside marketing and sales and HR that want to use Canva, as well as a bunch of improvements to our AI products and an actual enterprise skew that we're launching as well.

(01:01:13):
So through this growth and through getting to understand the needs of CIOs and heads of security at enterprises, we've realized that there pretty much needs to be a new enterprise product of Canva that meets the needs of hugely scaled teams, which has been quite different for us because we have scaled from those individuals just using the product all by themselves and organically growing the teams. And now looking at it from a top-down lens and building that enterprise products is what we've been focused on for the last couple of years. So we'll be pulling the covers off that as well in LA.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:50):
I see another hockey stick approaching. I'm excited of all these things you're launching. What a business you've built. I feel like it's still way too under the radar, even though it's this juggernaut. Nice work, Cameron and team. Two more questions I ask everyone, where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Cameron Adams (01:02:06):
They can find me online at themaninblue.com, which is my blog that's been around for 24 years now. What was the other question? How can you-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:15):
Yeah. How can listeners be useful to you?

Cameron Adams (01:02:18):
I love their design stories, how design has helped unlock something for them, whether it's starting their first business or helping a nonprofit that they volunteer at. I just love bumping into someone in the street and seeing the joy of design right up in their eyes. So please do that whenever you see me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
Beautiful. Cam, you're awesome. Canva is awesome. Go check out canva.com. Easy to find. Thanks for being here.

# The things engineers are desperate for PMs to understand | Camille Fournier (“The Manager’s Path”)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I'm curious what it is that PMs do that annoy engineers most.

Camille Fournier (00:00:04):
Hoarding credit. PMs, they tend to be the front-facing person for initiative. Engineers sometimes think that they don't get the credit for their work because the PM takes all the glory and all the credit for the project that they really worked very hard on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
I find the best PMs are the ones that talk the least and encourage other people to do the presenting-

Camille Fournier (00:00:23):
The next thing that engineers really get annoyed about with PMs, when they just don't understand the details and act like they don't matter, it just shows a real lack of empathy for the work that engineers are doing and I think it really can be very off-putting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:34):
Is there any insight you can give about what people may be missed about the motivation of engineers, what gets them excited?

Camille Fournier (00:00:40):
A lot of people assume that engineers just write code and don't underestimate the ability for your engineers to want to understand the business problem, want to understand the customer problem. I think the product managers that have done the best, they're not threatened by other people having ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today, my guest is Camille Fournier. Camille is one of the most respected technology executives in tech and the author of the Manager's Path, which many considered the definitive guide for navigating your career and moving into management. Over the course of her career, she was CTO of Rent The Runway, VP of technology at Goldman Sachs, global head of engineering and architecture at JP Morgan Chase and head of platform engineering at Two Sigma. She's also releasing a new book later this year called Platform Engineering, A Guide for Technical Product and People Leaders, which you can actually pre-order today and we get into this topic in the latter half of the conversation.

(00:01:36):
We also dig into what PMs do that most annoys engineers and how to stop doing these things. Why major rewrites are often a trap. Why you may want to be doing fewer one-on-ones. What most surprises people when they become a manager and some really useful heuristics for how long you should stay in IC before you make the leap into management and tons more. This episode covers a lot of ground and we'll help you think about management. platform teams, team culture and the PM and end relationship in a whole new way. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

(00:02:09):
It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Camille Fournier. Camille, thank you so much for being here, welcome to the podcast.

Camille Fournier (00:02:23):
Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:25):
It's my pleasure. I want to start by asking you a question that is on the minds of a lot of product managers is how to be less annoying as a product manager. I know you worked with a lot of engineers over time. I'm curious what it is that PMs do that annoy engineers most and how can PMs stop doing that?

Camille Fournier (00:02:42):
I would say there are a few things that PMs do that annoy engineers and to be clear, I am sure that engineers annoy PMs, just as much. So I've realized this is a two-way street. So I think there's some things that are really easy to fix and some things that are maybe a little bit harder. So the easy things to fix are hoarding credit. Sometimes I think PMs because they tend to be the front-facing person for initiatives, they're talking to customers, they're talking to the executive team, whatever. Engineers sometimes think that they don't get the credit for their work because the PM takes all the glory and all the credit for the project that they really worked very hard on, right?

(00:03:26):
So making every effort to be credit sharing and inclusive of the engineering team and giving them the opportunity to speak about their contributions when it makes sense. I think those are all things that PMs can do to avoid that kind of ... What I consider a pretty easy annoyance, just like don't pour it all the credit. This is not just you, right? There's a lot of work has to go into that. I think that sort of dovetails into the next thing that engineers really get annoyed about with PMs when they just don't understand the details and act like they don't matter and I think this is just a little bit of a cultural difference.

(00:04:05):
I mean, even managers, just normal managers, people like me who are looking across really broad areas or you have to be kind of big picture focused, and you forget that engineering done successfully really is all about the details and you don't necessarily have to understand all of those details, but when you act like they don't matter and you don't care about them and it's just like, I don't care, just like tell me when you can get this done or why is it going to take so long? My god, this just seems like such a little thing. It just shows a real lack of empathy for the work that engineers are doing and I think it really can be very off-putting.

(00:04:42):
Even though I will totally agree that sometimes you're going to get details that don't really matter and you just have to be a little bit patient in those circumstances.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX. If you're an engineering leader or on a platform team, at some point your CEO will inevitably ask you for productivity metrics, but measuring engineering organizations is hard and we can all agree that simple metrics like the number of PRs or commits doesn't tell the full story. That's where DX comes in. DX is an engineering intelligence solution designed by leading researchers, including those behind the DORA and SPACE frameworks. It combines quantitative data from developer tools with qualitative feedback from developers to give you a complete view of engineering productivity and the factors affecting it.

(00:05:28):
Learn why some of the world's most iconic companies like Etsy, Dropbox, Twilio, Vercel and Webflow rely on DX. Visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny. Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying. Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature, and these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone.

(00:06:09):
CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product, without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions, and they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites.

(00:06:42):
And they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. By the way, CommandBar just changed their name to Command AI.

Camille Fournier (00:07:08):
The third is playing telephone. Anybody in a manager role can fall victim to this, but I think PMs especially can be very annoying. So if you are being asked questions that you cannot answer because you just don't know or because that's something that involves a level of technical detail that only the engineers have that you just don't have, and you put yourself in this in-between position where people ask you questions, you turn around, you ask the engineers questions, you take whatever they say, especially when you don't really understand it, which happens sometimes, right? Go back to the original asker and sort of get in this middle-person scenario.

(00:07:51):
I think that is very annoying and frankly, it's a waste of time for everyone. This is something that managers of all stripes do, but PMs definitely do it and that drives engineers, particularly senior engineers on projects, it's crazy. And then, the last one that I wanted to put on this list is just when sometimes it feels like product managers want to hoard all the ideas for themselves, right? They want to be the ones that come up with every single sort of product idea and every single detail. What I see happen in those cases is that I see engineers start to over-engineer things, because engineers are like, well, I need to take control of something.

(00:08:30):
I want to have some creative outlet, so I'm going to use my engineering skills as my creative outlet and I'm going to spend a lot of time obsessing over the right framework or the right this, that or the other. That may actually not matter that much with products delivery, but when you take the people that are part of the project team out of the creative loop entirely, they're going to find that creative outlet somewhere else and it's actually kind of bad for the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):
That's really interesting, the last one. So you're saying if you keep engineers from having a voice in what you're building and prioritizing, that's what encourages engineers to rethink, let's just rebuild this thing, let's use a new framework, let's rewrite this system.

Camille Fournier (00:09:09):
Yeah, I mean that's my ... that happens without you doing that, sometimes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):
Yeah.

Camille Fournier (00:09:18):
I do think ... I think when I see it worst and I can basically always predict what I'm going to see, a lot of that kind of engineers building stuff, finding creative outlets and kind of building stuff, maybe they shouldn't be. I'm going to find that in places where they are so quashed their creativity for the actual business or product that they're building and their voice in that is so ignored that they don't have any outlets in that space and so, they are going to use the space that they have an outlet in, the place where they have some control and that's usually the technology choices and the details there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):
That's fascinating. I want to actually dig further into that around rewrites. You have a really interesting take on that, but before we get there, let me spend a little time on some of these. These are awesome. So on this theme of not involving engineers in ideation and coming up with what you're actually building, what have you seen just very tactically, is there anything you've seen that PM do super well?

Camille Fournier (00:10:17):
I think the product managers that have done the best, they're not threatened by other people having ideas. They're not threatened by the engineering team being full of smart people because they realize that yeah, some of the engineers may have good ideas, but they still don't really know how to do the product job. Just my experience is there are plenty of engineers who actually think they can be product managers and they don't really understand all of the elements of the product job that they would need to be successful. And when product managers take the time to build those relationships, well, make sure that people do feel like they can both share their ideas, but also that they start to appreciate what the job of this product person actually is.

(00:11:02):
And what they're really bringing to the table in terms of really how do we measure this input? How do we really understand the customers, how do we really think through the details of what's going to make this successful from a business or a customer perspective? I do think that that creates just a much better interaction pattern and then, engineers can feel good about sharing ideas and understanding that many of them won't go anywhere, but there's somebody that's actually going to listen and take the time to care about them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:37):
Coming back to some of the things that you said annoy engineers of PMs, this idea of playing the middle person, sounds like the solution clearly is there. Just connect the engineer to the other engineer or your engineer to the PM that's trying to figure this out, right?

Camille Fournier (00:11:49):
That one is not always easy because again, you have this tension of a lot of the job, of any management role is being in meetings and filtering stuff so that people who are in focus ... individual contributor mode can focus and get things done and not spend half of their weekend in meetings. You've just got to be very careful about knowing when you're crossing that line and when you're crossing it too often. And if you're having to often say, "Let me get back to you, let me get back to you, I don't know, let me get back to you." Maybe the person you're talking to is asking the wrong level of questions of you.

(00:12:26):
Maybe you need to connect them to the engineers directly, but just being aware that that shouldn't be a default behavior. That will happen occasionally, but it shouldn't be a thing that happens a lot because if it's happening a lot, then you're likely missing something, you're likely losing something in that telephone game translation and that's going to cause problems over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:47):
Awesome. So basically, if you're just finding your middle person too much, then it may be time to connect people directly. And I know the reason PMs often are afraid of this is the engineer may agree to something that they think is a bad idea for their team or may not understand all the ramifications on the product or just obviously, just spend their time in meetings and not be building anything.

Camille Fournier (00:13:12):
Yeah, yeah, and sometimes you mean you do it in a group meeting. I feel like Slack and other chat type things actually make it a lot easier to see, have the right people in a group in a thing, but again, that's distracting. So there's not an easy solution to that one, just I think it's important to be aware of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:27):
Yeah, that's a really good point. And then, in terms of hoarding credit, is there any tactical thing you've seen PMs do really well here is it, just every time they're announcing the product, "Hey, these engineers were involved or-"

Camille Fournier (00:13:37):
It's more than just saying thank you to all these people, but it's actually sometimes stepping back and letting other people speak, especially if it's something that's a really, really big technical lift. I don't think there's a super easy fix to that. I think it is just really being mindful that that can be very much a sore point for engineers when they just feel like, "This is my work, I'm not getting any credit for it, and this person is hogging all the glory."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:07):
I love that. Yeah, I find the best PMs are the ones that talk the least and encourage other people to do the presenting and announcing. And so, I think that's a really good reminder is let your engineers do that. Okay, amazing. So we talked a little bit about this idea of rewriting and how engineers sometimes just want to rewrite the system and I think a lot of PMs do too. A lot of times you're building your features on a thing that someone that doesn't even work at the company and were built five, 10 years ago, and there's always this sense of, "Okay, maybe we should just rewrite this thing everything will move so much faster."

(00:14:39):
Do you have a really interesting take that I think a lot of PMs will love to hear, which is that rewrites are often a big trap and often don't end up being what you think they might be? Can you just talk about your experience and perspective on this?

Camille Fournier (00:14:50):
Yeah, so I mean I have personally overseen a number of, if not quite rewrites, re-architectures and major system evolutions. So I absolutely do think they are sometimes a thing that needs to happen, but I also, have seen so many instances of cases where the engineers have convinced themselves that the only solution to the woes that they're experiencing with the system, it's hard to support, it's hard to change. Nobody wants to work on it, because it's this old crappy technology, is that they just have to go over to the side, build the new thing that will replace this old system and that is going to sort of free them from their misery.

(00:15:41):
And I think projects where you acknowledge that you do need to do an uplift, but you make a very thoughtful staged plan as to how you're going to do that, and you really think through, okay, we don't need to touch all of this stuff, but we're going to take the recommendation system, it really needs to be uplifted and that's a well-contained, you know, API and so we can start to fix that without having to change the whole whatever web framework, right? So I do think there are ways to do these evolutions, but people really underestimate. They underestimate the time to migrate stuff from the old system to the new system, is a huge, huge problem.

(00:16:24):
Particularly when you're talking about systems where you have sort of external people using the system in some way, whether it's web UIs or APIs. You think, "Oh, we kind of know what's going on, so it's not going to be that big a deal." Engineers notoriously, notoriously, notoriously, massively underestimate the migration time for old system to new system and that causes a lot of problems. By the way, you still have to support the old system while you're working on the new system. So I doubt many of the PMs in the audience are ever happy when they hear, we need to go away for six months, a year, two years to build this new thing and we just can't really add any features to the system in the interim.

(00:17:08):
That's infuriating, I'm sure, and frankly that's a problem and I don't know that that should be an acceptable answer in many cases. There may occasionally again be a case where that is what has to happen, but I think most of the time you can't really afford to just say we're going to go away and we're not going to touch the system for a long time and we're going to build something new over here. So many things about why that doesn't make any sense. So this is a little bit of field of the blog post that you're referring to. So, if you've got a system that doesn't really need feature enhancement or development because it's just sort of fine and the users are using it.

(00:17:47):
And it's just annoying to the engineers, why in the world would you invest so much money in writing a new version of it? There's a little bit of a cognitive dissonance that sometimes happens if you need to do new stuff and the old system literally is not ... it's not possible to do the new stuff that you need to do, you need to figure out a path to get to a sustainable system or you can continue to add and evolve. You should be investing and so there does need to be an investment, but you have to ask yourself, if I could go away and not touch this and not do anything to it for a long period of time without it really harming my business, is it worthwhile to change it at all?

(00:18:28):
Does it matter, and there's some questions there. I also think that when people try to do rewrites, particularly again if it's something that you're really trying to just move to a new language for example or sort of modernize in a certain way, [inaudible 00:18:45] a lot of times people really underestimate what the old system does and how well they know what the old system does. There's so much logic buried in legacy systems, it tends to be undocumented, it tends to be weird. You haven't thought through all the business rules, you haven't thought through the data formatting and I think again, it's much, much harder to replicate all the important things from the old system to the new system than people expect.

(00:19:14):
So there's more than that, but I do think sometimes you need to evolve systems and my advice would be when you're struggling making an evolution plan, take pieces potentially of the old system, uplift them, make them more scalable, make them easier to work with, clean up the tech debt, but trying to say we're going to just go away. We're going to rewrite, we're going to build something brand new and it's going to solve all our problems, it just very rarely works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:42):
I think a lot of PMs will be like, "Yes, thank you so much for saying this, because I think that's also always a big struggle between the ENG team and the PM team." So just to summarize what I think a lot of people miss or what you're saying a lot of people miss when they're thinking about let's rewrite this thing, is the migration to the new system, migrating customers, users, data to the new thing is going to take a lot longer than you expect. You underestimate knowing what it actually does and you're going to miss features and you can introduce new bugs. This actually is very similar to what I've seen with redesigning a whole product flow.

(00:20:15):
There's always this sense of let's just rethink this onboarding flow from scratch or let's rebuild this part of the product and always it ends up being a negative experiment result. It always ends up being less good and then, you have to spend all this time clawing back to get to where you were and also, you forget the stuff that would ... the features that you had and you're like, "Oh, shit, I forgot about that feature, I forgot about that feature." So it's interesting, there's a very similar situation in the product side. Okay, amazing. I'm going to go to a slightly different topic, which is around engineering leadership.

(00:20:45):
So I know you've written a lot about engineering leadership, you spent a lot of times with engineering leaders, so I have a few questions here. One is that I know that one of the things that haunts engineering leaders most is finding the balance between staying technical and their technical expertise, and their leadership expertise and basically finding the right altitude of how high ... where to be in the org and also how in the details to be, and also staying technical enough to be relevant. What have you learned in your own experience of finding that balance and how do you advise engineering leaders as they struggle with this?

Camille Fournier (00:21:18):
Yeah, so one piece of advice I give everybody is don't stop being a hands-on technical until you feel like it's in your bones. You feel like you've got mastery that you could ... if you know a second language fluently or if you played an instrument really, really seriously for a long time or maybe a sport really, really seriously for a long time, you'll be familiar with the ... I haven't done that in a long time, but if I was to pick it up, it would be rusty, but I would get there pretty quickly, right? Maybe physically, I wouldn't be as strong as I was or whatever, but I would get there. You can do that with writing code.

(00:21:58):
You can do that with technical skills if you do it for long enough, I think you can develop sort of a baseline mastery, where you're not going to be as fast and a lot of the challenges of being technical is actually in all the tooling and all the tooling evolution, but you're not going to be necessarily as fast as people who have been doing it, but you won't be completely clueless and I think that all the things you learn getting to that really comfortable mastery of some part of hands-on tech will stay with you and will help you just maintain a level of confidence in your own technical know-how and maintain a level of empathy for what it means to be a good engineer.

(00:22:38):
And I think just make you a lot less anxious about being hands-off, even though I think everybody who makes that transition for a year or two, especially if you're really have to be hands-off or you just don't have time to write code at all, you are going to be anxious for a while no matter what. The things to then think about from that point is, being technical is also just about knowing what's going on and paying attention and being able to ask ... what people care about with technical leaders in my experience is they want people who actually seem like they sort of understand what you're doing and can ask good questions and help guide you to better decisions without actually being the one who's like, "Oh no, you need to use this library instead of that library."

(00:23:25):
It's actually sort of annoying when somebody that's very senior and hands-off tries to tell you, don't use this library, use that library because I don't know about you, but I don't really believe people who have been hands-off for that long when they try to tell me what to do and the thing that I'm kind of the expert in right now, but I do appreciate it when I'm given more guidance around, well, have you considered this? Tell me about how you're planning to handle that situation. What are the major technical challenges with implementing this and that can actually spend the time to listen and ask thoughtful questions on the back of that.

(00:24:00):
The last thing I would say is surround yourself with smart technical people, also as much as you can, and be willing to listen to them, talk about tech and ask them questions about things. I feel like that's part of the reason that I am able to stay technically savvy and credible amongst people who work for me is not that I'm writing code because I'm not. But I am listening to a lot of very smart people talk about technology a lot, down to the level of I'm trying to debug this database issue, what the heck is going on? And just constantly being interested in those stories and learning from them and learning what really smart engineers are thinking about and worrying about.

(00:24:47):
The more you can build that network of people that are still hands-on and stay in touch with that, I do think that helps a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:56):
So on my last point, how are you actually doing that? Is it watching ... going to conferences with friends, something else?

Camille Fournier (00:25:01):
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I guess for me it started with going to conferences, meeting people. Now, I'm in a lot of different chat groups where people are just sort of regularly communicating, staying in touch with ... staying in touch with former colleagues. I will admit I'm kind of a social person and I have a big network, so this may be easier said than done, but I do think being in the right group chats ... I also think, I'm sure reading various tech news and tech sort of commentary and discussion boards, I mean it's definitely a mixed bag of that stuff I think that like ... but there are smart people. You find the smart people in there, you sort of follow what they're saying. I think that's another good way to keep that perspective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:51):
Is it a sign, I wonder if you're not interested in that anymore that maybe you should move into something else. I don't know. If you're like, don't really pay attention to engineering technicalness.

Camille Fournier (00:26:02):
It's hard for me to say because I'm such a nerd. I really love tech. I'm in this industry, because I'm just actually genuinely very interested in certain corners, not every corner of technology but certain corners of technology. I want to know what the latest stuff that's happening in databases and infrastructure and I find it all very interesting. I find the problems interesting. So I think that makes me very successful because I just have that natural curiosity and passion and interest in it. But I don't know that that's a total prerequisite.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):
Yeah, but you've been talking about ... it reminds me a little bit of this guy, LevelsIO on Twitter. Have you heard of this guy? He was just on Lex Friedman. Have you listened to that yet?

Camille Fournier (00:26:47):
I think maybe I saw a clip of it, but I haven't listened to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:48):
So I think one of the most successful indie engineers where he just works on his own thing all by himself, never raises money, just launch his products that make money. And a funny thing about him is he works ... all stuff is in PHP and jQuery. He's just like, this works. I've always had this to do, learn Node.js, learn Python. And I'm like, I'm too busy to build ... while I'm building to learn these new things and he's been incredibly successful. So it touches on sometimes maybe you don't need to just keep rewriting to the newest frameworks.

Camille Fournier (00:27:15):
Yeah, no, I mean look, I actually ... I feel like I know a lot of smart engineers who are in that category. They're like, we built amazing things in PHP and relatively simple SQL and so much of tech is over-engineering things and I don't totally disagree. I think the challenge is though, of course, what works as a one person show, doesn't always work in a scaled organization for better or for worse, we're in different like, you've got to match what makes one person really productive. Will it make 100 people, 1000 people, even 10 people really productive? That's always a little hard to tell and that's why I do think you should be not ... I think it's always a good idea to be keeping up with what's happening and what's changing in whatever kind of side of tech you're in, but not obsessively chasing every fad.

(00:28:15):
I think being aware of, but not necessarily chasing them, but particularly, if you're working in groups, teams, larger companies, even midsize companies, there is some amount of, you're balancing the tech that makes one person go fast with the tech that makes 10 or 100 people go fast and those are not always exactly the same thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:35):
Just to kind follow this thread a little bit and to kind of nerd snipe you a little bit, is there a platform or language or framework these days that you're either very excited about that you think is helping people move faster and do better work or the opposite just like this is ... everyone is excited but this is not good.

Camille Fournier (00:28:52):
I will say this, one example I actually put in my own notes for this conversation was GraphQL. I would not tell a team to use or not use GraphQL at this point because it's a bit out of my expertise zone and my level of management. It's not really my job anyway, but it is one of the things that is both popular and thought relatively poorly of by most of the senior people that I know. And so, I guess I would say that's one where I would say if you're seriously thinking about it and you're not Facebook, you may really want to make sure you know what problem you're trying to solve because the impression that I have from sort of listening to people talk about it is that GraphQL is kind of trying to promise front-end engineers that they don't really have to collaborate with backend engineers.

(00:29:49):
And they can just sort of build whatever and it'll all be fine, and it just doesn't ever seem to work out that well for anybody who actually does it in practice. Again, obviously, it can work out that well because Facebook has made a great go of it. I'm sure there are other companies that are, but that's one where it's not that new but it remains one of these things where it seems like an interesting fad that maybe is burning a lot of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):
That's awesome. I appreciate you sharing that. I don't know if this is exactly an example of this, but on that podcast levels, I forget his actual name, Peter I think, shared that whenever there's a framework that has a VC funded startup behind it, that's not a good sign because their job now is to convince engineers to use it and then pay for it and that's not necessarily going to be the best product.

Camille Fournier (00:30:34):
That's true. Although I will say that some of the most time-wasting frameworks have also just come out of big companies, or the context of the big company that may have made that framework super useful within that context doesn't translate to startup or small company or even big company that doesn't have the rest of the context set, but I don't think ... He's not wrong. I also just think big companies share the blame on that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):
I guess we should all just come back to PHP and jQuery and be simple.

Camille Fournier (00:31:09):
Maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:10):
Okay, so to close out this thread on engineering leaders, finding the right balance, just to summarize your advice here. One is get to mastery before and is your advice here, get to this point before you move into engineering.

Camille Fournier (00:31:23):
Engineering management. I will say part of this is also in particular, if you happen to be a woman or otherwise, underrepresented person in tech because people will tend to underestimate your technical abilities just unfortunately as a get-go. I also think it's particularly important to kind of develop that internal confidence in your abilities before you make this sort of scary leap, which is scary for everyone of have a ... if you have that mastery before you make the leap, I wish more people would do this because honestly, I do think there are a lot of people who never really gained the mastery. They go into management, they lose it and some of them are still perfectly good managers and look, there are good managers who were never technical to begin with.

(00:32:09):
I don't want to say that that's impossible. I just think that if you care about being technical, if you are technical now and you want to maintain that tech-savvy, don't just become a manager the first time somebody offers it to you. Make sure you've really spent your good time writing code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:28):
Is there a number of years heuristic you think about or some way to tell you that maybe you've hit that point?

Camille Fournier (00:32:34):
I think this has been since disproven, but it was that 10,000 hours idea of mastery at some point. For me, it was like an undergraduate degree, a graduate degree, and four or five years of full-time work. So maybe I might be slow. I didn't start coding a lot in middle school like people might do now, but I felt like ... I took several years of hands-on work in a very intense undergraduate and graduate programs for me. So I do think it's probably somewhere in the 10-year range of really having spent a lot of your time over those years writing code and really understanding how to be a technical expert.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:17):
Got it. So essentially if you're thinking about moving into management as an engineer, you may want to wait until you've done it for 10 years in some form, which I think is a lot longer than a lot of people would've thought. And I imagine many people are not doing that. And then, in your experience not doing it as well, it could be-

Camille Fournier (00:33:35):
If you were programming a lot in high school and you got an undergraduate degree, so let's say you've got six years-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
I see.

Camille Fournier (00:33:42):
You may only need four or five years of work, 40 hour a week writing code experience. I'm sure it depends on the company, but I do think when you see people that are 23, they are just out very recently out of school, it's a different thing if you're a founder and that's a whole different life, but if you're at a big company and somebody is like you have great communication skills, why don't you start to become a manager? Often they're actually pushing you to become a project manager, which is actually also the worst sort of path to real leadership in my opinion. If you don't feel like you're done ... Also, if you just don't feel like you're done, if you're still having fun writing code, don't rush becoming a manager, writing code is awesome. Have fun, enjoy it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
I know exactly what you mean. So I used to be an engineer, actually I was an engineer for 10 years. I definitely don't have mastery at this point. I moved into product from that and I definitely so missed actually just sitting there and writing code and building stuff, that was very hard to give up. I imagine you still missed that.

Camille Fournier (00:34:45):
I think I might've forgotten about it at this point, but there is nothing as satisfying because you get the fast feedback loop. It's just wonderful. Yeah.

On the topic of moving into management, you wrote maybe the definitive book on engineering manager career path, and so when someone moves from IC to management, what do you find is the most surprising thing to them? What do they most often not understand or are surprised by like, "Oh man, I did not see this as part of my job or my life."

Camille Fournier (00:36:24):
Yeah, I mean I think there's a few things. I do think ... assuming that they're actually trying to do it well, I do think there are a lot of people who move into management and then just don't really understand the job at all and aren't even self-aware enough to know that they don't understand it, but for those who are trying to do it, trying to do it well. I think a few things that tend to surprise them are the fact that you really don't own your time as a manager. Your team and your management and the company owns your time. More and more the more senior you become as a manager. I think individual contributors often think that if they become a manager, they will still have some of the freedom that they have as a senior individual contributor.

(00:37:08):
But then they'll also be able to tell people what to do and they'll have all this authority. And the reality is, management is much more ... I'm not a huge fan of servant leadership exactly, but management really is a service job. You are serving the team, you are serving the company. Your job is to help make things better and that usually doesn't mean that you're making all the decisions. It usually doesn't mean that you snap your fingers and people jump. Because if you try that, especially in tech, right? People are just going to revolt. They're not going to listen to you. It's just too hard to have ... that's not the culture that we live in.

(00:37:53):
And I don't think that's a good culture. I don't think that command and control, I tell you what to do and you do it. It just doesn't create creativity, right? It's the same thing as like PMs, trying to have all the ideas, right? No, you've got all these brilliant people working for you on a team, your job as a manager is not to tell them what to do in every single case. Occasionally, yes, a lot more. If you're trying to convince them of what you think should happen. In some ways, you're sort of nudging, you're encouraging, you're directing, you're setting guardrails for processes or behaviors or whatever, but it's not this glorious fearless leader.

(00:38:36):
I make all these decisions and everyone looks up to me and it's awesome kind of job. It's much more grueling, much more ... you are really just sort of reacting to things in the moment. And it can be very ... it's a hard job. I do think particularly management when done well, when you're really trying to do it in a thoughtful kind, but also, productive way is a very hard job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:06):
I wonder if engineering is where most ... where the highest percentage of people that move into management move back to IC. I've seen that a bunch and I wonder if engineers are the most common.

Camille Fournier (00:39:16):
I don't know, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:18):
After realizing what you just said is true, like, "Oh, what I done-"

Camille Fournier (00:39:22):
So do you not think product managers also do this? Because I think product managers also actually suffer from exactly this kind of-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:28):
They do.

Camille Fournier (00:39:28):
Maybe sometimes-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:28):
They do.

Camille Fournier (00:39:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:30):
But interestingly, I was an engineering manager earlier in my career. I really did not like it. I was very unhappy in that role. As a PM manager though, I was very happy, it was a lot easier.

Camille Fournier (00:39:43):
Yeah, because PMs are way easier to manage. PMs are awesome to manage. PMs want to ... they're just so helpful. They want to do this ... they're good communicators. I love managing PMs. I have to say, I have to say, just my experience, engineers are such a pain. They're all primadonnas. I am an engineer, but PMs are more fun to manage my experience. So actually, you have a point. You have a point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:12):
But I wonder. Yeah, because I haven't seen a lot of PM managers move back to IC product management. I find that once you can build product through teams and not sit there all day in Excel and check in on deadlines and things, it's hard to give that part up. You kind of enjoy being higher up in that chain. Yeah. Kind of along these lines, something that you have a really interesting perspective on is one-on-ones. Most people are like have one-on-ones with everyone, have them regularly, they're really important. You actually have this contrarian take that maybe you should have less one-on-ones, especially as an engineering manager, you talk about that.

Camille Fournier (00:40:46):
Yeah, so to be clear, you should have one-on-ones with your direct reports and your manager and you should hold those sacred ... I tend to do my weekly or maybe every other week. So this is not about that set of one-on-ones. So the one-on-ones of the people that you are directly managing and with your own manager. But I think there is this ... I don't know if it's the remote work, sort of explosion that's happened or it's big companies or what, but what I've seen and I've heard a lot of friends at many companies complain about is this idea that everybody is doing one-on-ones with everyone else. So the manager is doing one-on-ones with their team. They're also doing one-on-ones with all of their peers.

(00:41:35):
They're doing one-on-ones with all of their stakeholders. They're doing one-on-ones with product and design. And I think that it's just not a scalable approach, right? Linearly scale with the number of relationships you have. And so, as your company grows, as the number of things your team supports grow, as the team grows, you just can't scale that way. You cannot expect to maintain a one-on-one approach to kind of organizational relationship building and awareness passed a fairly small team/company. I also think that people think that one-on-ones will solve all of their problems. And I think the reality is you have this one-on-ones with people that don't really want to have a one-on-one with you.

(00:42:30):
If they're not in the mind to invest in your relationship, if they don't really care about what you're doing, they actually may not like it that you're asking them for a one-on-one, let me show up like, because it's like, okay, well I should do this to be a good corporate citizen or whatever. But they're just like, why are we doing this? What is the point of this? I also think that one-on-ones, particularly when you use them first of stakeholder management. So when you're meeting with people that's not your team, but other stakeholders that you may need to deal with, if you have a lot of stakeholders ... so I've been in a lot of positions where I have a lot of internal stakeholders because I build internal platforms is a big part of what my job has been in the last many years.

(00:43:07):
Having all these meetings as one-on-ones with those stakeholders can actually be kind of a weakness because when your stakeholders just tell you in a one-on-one that they're happy or unhappy with things, your unhappy stakeholders aren't hearing that. So you may have one really unhappy stakeholder and five really happy ones and all you're saying to your unhappy one is, "Well, everybody else is happy and they're not seeing it for themselves." And they're just having to say, "Trust me, because I've had these other one-on-ones with all these people and they're saying it's fine." And it just kind of sounds whiny.

(00:43:37):
And so, when you're dealing with a lot of stakeholders and trying to just rely on one-on-one management of that is actually not very productive in a lot of ways. So in general, I guess I just think people should respect their own time more. As much as I just said management, you're kind of at everyone's mercy and that is true, but also respect your time. Don't just load yourself up with meetings because you're a manager and that's your job. Do you really have something to talk to a person about? Do you really need to ... when you have a one-on-one meeting with someone, you are asking for their time. You shouldn't just be doing that kind of haphazardly for fun.

(00:44:24):
This is a little bit of my personality. I'm not a great company networker. Some people are really good at just like, let's go to get coffee, let's go to lunch and let's hang out and build a relationship. And honestly, those people are really successful in many ways that I am not. I do sort of envy that skill. I'm really good if I work with you. If I work with you on something, generally speaking, people really come to respect me because I'm very engaged and I'm a really good collaborator in various ways, but I'm really bad at just getting to know you random one-on-one, where we don't have a purpose to the meeting.

(00:44:57):
And that's not to say those are always bad, but I do think that a lot of people with ... that's your comfort zone, if that getting to know you, random, relationship building one-on-one is your comfort zone, I should probably do more of them. You should probably do fewer of them because you should always be pushing yourself to get out of your comfort zone and are you really getting something out of that or are you just being able to tick a checkbox that says, I had eight meetings today, therefore I was productive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):
Yeah, that super resonates. Kind of pulling on this thread of how you operate and how you work something that I've heard you're really known for, is creating a work culture where people work really hard but also, have a really good work-life balance. And when we were chatting, you, you actually told me you're not a great believer in working too hard. Can you just talk about this philosophy on building a great culture where people don't work too hard but also, get stuff done and don't burn out?

Camille Fournier (00:45:51):
I think we all understand that if we could just figure out and focus on really the most important things, we would just ... everything would be better. And it's hard to figure out what the most important things are, but overwork kind of lets you just sidestep doing the hard work of figuring out what's important in the first place. I listened to one of your podcasts where you talked to someone who said, if you've never fired someone and regretted it, you don't know where the line is, of who you should and shouldn't buy. And I will admit I have mixed feelings about that, although I get what you're saying. If you don't regularly reset your expectations of what you should and shouldn't let slide, do you have any idea where the line of what is actually important to work on is?

(00:46:41):
I just think ... and the thing about that is it's not like firing people where you do it once or twice and you regret it and you learn pretty quickly, unfortunately. I think you actually have to kind of regularly test the circumstances and challenge with, am I really getting the most out of myself? Am I really producing the best value or am I just making ... swaging my internal guilt about I need to work 60-hour weeks, I need to sleep in the office, I need to whatever, to show that I'm a hard worker and I care. And so, I guess I do really think that people should challenge themselves to be focused and get the important stuff done and always be asking themselves what is important to do?

(00:47:37):
And what's important to do does change over time. But if you're not regularly doing an audit of your time and trying to knock things off that list that don't matter, you're probably wasting a lot of time on things that don't matter and okay, you don't want to work less. You love working a lot, that's fine, but you could probably just be getting a lot more valuable stuff done if you would do these audits regularly, right? I also think people don't delegate enough. So, if you don't delegate, then you get overwhelmed because your team doesn't know how to do anything, because you haven't bothered to spend the time delegating, which actually takes more time initially, usually, you have to teach people whatever it is that you're trying to get them to do.

(00:48:19):
Not always, sometimes they'll surprise you and they're better at it than you are, but maybe not. And so, you have to teach them, but then you finally ... you freed yourself up to scale. So I guess I'm just a real believer that working hard and a focused way for over fewer hours I think is a more productive way to approach work. And I think I have lived my career that way. I've been successful in it and I have encouraged it and people who have worked for me, and I think I've seen a lot of success through it, but it's not a thoughtless exercise. It's an active process of constant reflection to get to that focus.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:11):
For someone that is listening to this and is like, I want to start doing this, is there anything ... any specific practice you've found useful or any specific tactic to actually do this well?

Camille Fournier (00:49:23):
I think there's different approaches you could take, right? One approach you could take is just like every Friday I'm going to stop working at 4 PM or something, let's say, and I am not, or I'm not going to let myself work this weekend. Forcing yourself to log off, forcing yourself to have boundaries and saying ... and then doing out of what did I get done, I think can help. That's scary. And people don't like doing that, but I do think that that's one of the best ways to do it is really just saying, I'm going to log off. I'm going to log off every day this week at 6 PM. I'm going to ... because your brain is probably going to keep thinking.

(00:50:10):
You might still be a little stressed out, you're still thinking about work, you're still worrying about it, but there is a difference between thinking about it and doing it, and particularly for those of you who are earlier in your careers, this was actually, I think one of the reasons that I did get to mastery was because I was extremely good at being focused when I was at work, when I was a hands-on programmer and really writing code for many of the hours of the day. And that meant I was not ... this was pre heavy social media. I was much less distracted, which I don't know if I would be able to do it in the modern era as easily, but having that real heavy focus time because I was like, "I don't want to work on the weekend. I don't want to stay here until 9 PM every night. I just want to get this done." And it meant that I didn't do quite as many copies.

(00:50:58):
I didn't go to lunch and chat with people all every day, but I was very, very productive and I learned to get a lot done in a short period of time. And I do think learning those skills earlier in your career and then continuing to apply them throughout your career is another piece of advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):
In terms of staying and getting focused, is there anything that helps you focus? Is it like headphones, a drink? What gets you in the zone?

Camille Fournier (00:51:24):
I mean, yeah, I have a lot of rituals. I have my caffeination rituals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:31):
Say more.

Camille Fournier (00:51:32):
Well, I mean I can't drink coffee anymore because my stomach got messed up at some point, but I drink tea in the morning. I drink caffeinated water also. I have a Diet Coke at lunch, so I have these rituals of my caffeine hits that help me. I have to be in a quiet place. I do find non-music that is ... I really like Four Tet, for example, as music to focus or the new Andre 3000 Flute album is extremely good for focusing, where it's not quite predictable, no lyrics and not quite predictable. For me, that helps me focus a lot. I can't be listening to any words and focus. My brain just cannot ignore words. So those are some of the things I use to help folks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):
That is awesome. I have a similar caffeine strategy. I'm drinking tea always during these podcasts and this little thing I got here and then, my wife doesn't want me to drink Diet Coke because she thinks the sugar and it is not good, but I still drink it sometimes and it works great. I switched to green tea. That's my approach. Start with black tea and then switch to green tea.

Camille Fournier (00:52:40):
That's smart.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:41):
Man, there's so many things you shared that I wanted to dig into. Let me share a couple of things. Your point about delegating I thought was really important, and there's another benefit to learning to delegate, which is team members feel empowered. You give them a chance to take on responsibility and they feel like I have an opportunity to show I can do this other thing.

Camille Fournier (00:53:02):
Yeah, and you're never going to scale if you don't delegate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:06):
Yeah, and it's hard to start learning to do that, but once you get good at it, it becomes so great. I love just delegate everything every time, and people enjoy it. They're like, "Amazing. You're giving me opportunity." The thing you said about how ... if you're not sometimes regretting something you cut or potentially firing someone you don't regret, Elon actually, Elon Musk has a great approach to this. I don't know if you've heard his philosophy on optimizing. He has this whole five-step process of figuring out how to optimize something, and one of them is try to cut things like, do we need this thing or not? And if you don't recognize that 10% of stuff you cut, it was a mistake, you're probably not cutting enough stuff.

Camille Fournier (00:53:45):
You'll have to figure out your own metrics. But I definitely think testing the limits, it's scary though. I'm going to be honest. Doing that is always scary. It brings up like, I forgot to finish the assignment nightmares of school, especially for the overachievers that often end up in these kinds of companies and jobs. Again, you got to do things that scare you or you're never going to grow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:14):
Okay, I'm going to go in a whole different direction. You've got a book coming out about platform engineering and platform teams. This is something that I get a lot of questions about. A lot of people are thinking about moving to a platform team or struggling working on a platform team or struggling working with a platform team. So I have a bunch of questions along these lines. The first is I asked a bunch of people that worked with you what to ask you and someone that worked with you shared this quote about his frustration working with platform teams that he's often complaining to you about and he works on customer-facing products. And so, he said platform teams that are often slow.

(00:54:48):
They're often pushing us to compromise on features to adopt their systems. They often get infinite funding even though they don't have to show any ROI. And so, maybe from the perspective of working with a platform team, say you're building something customer-facing, any tips for effectively working with a platform team and building a great relationship there.

Camille Fournier (00:55:08):
I'm very sympathetic to anybody who feels that way because part of the reason that I wrote this book, I co-wrote it with a friend, Ian Nolan, is that so many platform teams are guilty of all the things that he's complaining about, that my friend was complaining about, that they don't listen, they're not delivering effectively, they're not explaining their value to the company. And it is infuriating when you're dealing with that. And honestly, I'm very sympathetic. The thing that I would say though is the more you can, first of all, spend the time understanding that the platform team's problems a little bit and trying to collaborate and work with them and be clear about what it is you actually need and how you're willing to work with them, I think the better.

(00:56:01):
I think if you get mad and you just try to avoid them or undermine them or whatever, that may work in the long run, but it's just going to make everything worse in the short run. So I do think that if you've got a platform team that you're frustrated with, some tips, I would put are like, "Look, find the parts of that team that are good because I'm sure there are some," right? Maybe the databases team is awesome. And really make sure you are maintaining a good relationship with that part of the team and you can point to how you are collaborating extremely well with that part of the team. Help give them product feedback.

(00:56:44):
This is annoying but sometimes needs to happen because a lot of companies, I actually think product ... you need to have a product mindset and frankly, you need to have product managers to build good platforms, internal platforms. A lot of companies just don't do this. They don't believe that they should waste head count on product managers for internal teams. So you end up with this platform team that has a lot of smart engineers, but they don't really know what to build. So they're just sort of building whatever they think is right. And so sometimes your job is to product manage them, is to tell them, these are the problems that we have and this is what we need.

(00:57:16):
And the clearer you can be about that, particularly when they don't have a product team, oftentimes, you can kind of lead them from the side in that way. And so I think that's another approach that I would take when you're in that situation. Find the parts of the team that are working and working well with your team and make sure you develop those relationships and try to just get over the anger and frustration and just be clear about what it is that you need and help them understand what they should really be doing and building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):
That is really interesting advice. So especially, you're saying if they don't have a PM helping, make sure they're guiding things well, is you can help them ... basically help them think through stuff that will benefit them and also, help the stuff that you're trying to get done.

Camille Fournier (00:58:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:04):
That's awesome advice. Okay, so what about from the leadership perspective, trying to build an effective platform team, do you have any advice on how to structure these teams and incentivize these teams to help them be successful?

Camille Fournier (00:58:17):
First of all, I'm a very strong believer that platform engineering has to involve software engineering. If you don't have any software engineers on your platform team and you only have more operations systems engineers, DevOps, SRE, which I realize there are some SREs that are software engineers, but they tend to not want to write big software. I think you're kind of missing the picture. Platform engineering is not just maintaining cloud infrastructure and doing small scripts or blueprints or enablement projects for other teams, because that doesn't really create a cohesive and coherent platform. It doesn't create products and frankly you need to be ... platforms are products, ultimately.

(00:59:04):
You should be thinking about how do I create coherent offerings that make this company more productive? So you need software engineers. Yes, you need sort of operations systems, SRE specialists as well. And of course, you need product people. I had product teams on ... product managers for all of my platform teams. I've really developed out that practice in the companies that I've worked for doing this because I just believe that you're not going to get great results if you just believe that to engineers and engineering management. They will do their best and you do occasionally find engineers that have really great product instincts in this space, but the actual details.

(00:59:49):
And focus of the product work is just you can't write a bunch of code and/or manage a big software engineering team and be a product manager at the same time. That's actually just asking, I think, too much of people to do that really well, at least for very long. So I think when it comes to structuring a team, recognize this is not just like SRE V2. This is more than that. You want software engineers, you want systems engineers, you want product people. And then, one of the reasons you want product folks is because you want to be thinking about impact-based, outcome-based approaches, not just like, "Well, we built this thing that seemed cool, we adopted this technology from this company because that's what everybody on the internet is talking about."

(01:00:36):
Whether it's VC funded or big company. We actually thought about what are the problems the engineers at my company are facing? How can we improve their productivity or deliver leverage to this business through whatever it is we're building, right? Are we reducing the cycle time for engineering tasks? Are we solving problems that are preventing products from launching and scaling? Are we making really meaningful cost reductions or efficiencies and, in our products or in our platforms? These are some examples of measurable contributions, but I think one of the challenges is that people create these platform teams and think that they can be sort of divorced from having an impact focus because it's like, "Well, you just got to run the infrastructure and make sure it works."

(01:01:29):
And it's like, "No, you actually do still have to do ... if you do that OKR stuff or goal setting," or whatever, you've got to take a lot of the best practices of product. It's a little different in the internal world, but it's still very important if you want to do platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:45):
On the line of having PMs within the platform teams. Some of the best PMs I've ever worked with where PMs on platform teams, and that just tells me, it's not like where you put PMs that are just meant like that's ... where you could have some of the highest leverage because platform teams enable the rest of the company to move faster.

Camille Fournier (01:02:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:02):
And one difference there, I'm curious if you agree, is your ratio of PM to engineer can be a lot higher. You can have a lot more engineers per PM on platform teams.

Camille Fournier (01:02:10):
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's right because I think so much of the work in a platform team is not exactly product work. A lot of it is like scaling or really deep kind of technical, like I got to figure out how to actually do this technical thing or I've got to do this performance efficiency and you don't always need a product spec for that, right? It is often just a very engineering heavy task. So yes, I think the ratios do tend to be a bit different.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:42):
We dove over right into this topic. Maybe it might be helpful to help people understand what is a platform team, just what are examples of teams that would be considered platform teams.

Camille Fournier (01:02:51):
I mean, I guess the high level definition that I have of platform engineering is if you are developing and operating platforms that ... where they're trying to manage overall system complexity and deliver leverage to your business. So a lot of the teams that people think about nowadays and when they're talking about platform teams, they're talking a lot about teams that may have formerly been called dev tools. For example, so your CI/CD tooling for the company, a lot of the cloud infrastructure provisioning and tooling. If you're at a company with certain technical problems, you may very well be building semi bespoke storage systems. For example, maybe part of your platform teams. I actually think that there are ... And then, actually web frameworks ... Web mobile framework and support for that.

(01:03:50):
That set of engineering can also be part of a platform offering. I actually kind of believe that there's also sort of what you might call integration platforms or platforms that are in between that infrastructurey developer tooly stuff and products. So billing platforms for example, if you have a single billing platform for all of the different products in your company, that shares a lot of overlaps in the challenges of those more dev tools, infrastructurey platform teams because you're probably supporting lots of different product lines that are using this system that needs to be able to scale with certain efficiencies. You need to still do the product discovery.

(01:04:33):
You probably have a little bit more of a business product focus than the pure internal tools teams, but that gets to the blended area.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:44):
For founders that are earlier stage or companies that are smaller hearing this and they're like, "Oh, shit do I need a platform team?" So yeah, you're shaking your head, if people aren't watching on YouTube. What's a sign that's time maybe to start creating a platform team and setting aside resources for something like that?

Camille Fournier (01:05:00):
So first of all, I think it gets to be like, you have 50 plus engineers. I don't think this is the kind of thing that you start when you are 10 engineers, right? But when you are ... so there's a lot of ad hoc coordination that's probably happening amongst your engineering groups right now, where maybe you just have one ... you have your GitHub and somebody is making sure that all of that stuff is sort of working. You have a few cloud databases and you got a couple of people on each team and they kind of share notes to figure out what's going on or whatever. Okay, it's all good, but at some point, you hit either a lot of inefficiency where you're seeing the same people across a bunch of different teams.

(01:05:54):
Each team has the same kind of people having to solve the same kinds of problems. It just seems like why do I have three people in every team, dealing with this instead of centralizing it and making it a little more efficient. It also could be that you hit some core scaling issue that starts to really need a dedicated team to solve. Again, that could be developer productivity. Every development team is trying to do it their own way and everybody is just super slow because you just can't get code released and it all has to be coordinated across every different team and it's just like, what is going on? We need to fix that or you actually have a technical challenging area that needs a focused team to fix the scaling.

(01:06:36):
Those are some of the signs that you may want to start thinking about a platform team, but it's really like ... generally speaking, I would not jump into it early. This is something for companies that have matured where it's worth investing and making people internally more productive and centralizing certain functions just from a cost and efficiency basis at minimum.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:02):
Say you're on a platform team, say you're an engineer or even a PM, any advice for how to be successful and thrive within that environment and be a great platform team.

Camille Fournier (01:07:11):
If you want to do platforms. If you're an engineer, certainly if you're an engineer or an engineering manager, you've got to remember that half of the work is actually the operational quality, operational excellence of these things. Platform engineering is not just writing code and then throwing it over the walls to someone. Being interested and passionate about the operational challenges and scaling bits of systems I do think is fairly important, if you want to be a great platform engineer from a software engineer perspective, if you're more like a product manager, "Look, you've got to really care about ..." I think you got to be really both interested in working with really smart engineers who are going to know way more than you do about things.

(01:08:06):
And almost being a really good, not necessarily zero to one but past one person because actually a lot of the best platform type offerings in companies start in individual application teams. An application team has a problem and they solve it for themselves and it turns out that that's actually a really good idea for how to solve that problem. So a good platform team is often looking around for those and then sort of taking them and then assimilating them and making them available to more and more people. And so, I think if you want to be in that kind of zero to one building the brand new stuff all the time, you may not be as happy in a platform team.

(01:08:45):
But if you're really interested a little bit more of taking things over, stabilizing, scaling them, making them efficient, making them evolve as a company evolves, I think you'll be happier in that circumstance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:01):
Awesome. Is there anything else along these lines before we wrap up and yet a very exciting lightning round that you think might be helpful for folks working with platform teams or working on a platform team, building platform teams?

Camille Fournier (01:09:14):
I think there are two things that we haven't touched on or maybe three that are really hard about platform teams and that I think don't get much press, which is running platform projects is a little bit different than running agile projects. You can take a lot of the best practices you may have learned from agile type product delivery, but you are running longer, running larger scale, more complex builds because a lot of the stuff that you build at the platform level just takes longer. It's a little bit more complicated. So you've got to be willing to get into that kind of stuff, especially if you're in a management job in that space.

(01:09:55):
You are going to deal with a lot of migrations as well. So it is very annoying. Migrations happen, even if you don't force them on people, your a cloud provider is going to say, oh, you've got to migrate from EKS view 19 to 121 or whatever, and that may require changes in code and then that's a real pain in the butt for all of the application teams. So people who are interested in how to smooth over the customer and company impact of this underlying change, I think we'll be very happy in platform teams. If you're not interested in that, you may not enjoy the work as much. There's just a lot of detail oriented work and platforms. And then of course, the final part is the stakeholders are a nightmare. My friend who wrote the question about how his product or his platform partners drive him crazy. I have no doubt he drives them crazies.

(01:10:55):
Because you've got all of these stakeholders, your peers and tech, maybe product managers, maybe executives that are like, what is this team? Are they really worth the money? Why are we spending so much on it? I don't understand what they're doing. I could do it better in some cases. So there's actually a big part of the job, particularly as either product managers or engineering leadership is stakeholder management and really learning how to do that well. And that is not always, that's probably I think universally agreed to be the least fun part of the job. I don't think anybody loves it, but it is certainly a skill set. I'm glad that I have. And so, I think if you are thinking about building one of these teams.

(01:11:40):
And you're like, I can just do the fun tech stuff or the cool product stuff, I'm really passionate about engineering productivity or I'm really passionate about state scale storage systems and I don't want to think about any of the other stuff. You may not actually be happy in the long run in leadership positions. It may be fine as an individual contributor, but for leaders in particular, there's a lot more to it than the fun tech problems, the fun operations problems, even the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:07):
You said there's a few things we haven't touched on. Is there anything else?

Camille Fournier (01:12:13):
That's the fastest and anybody who's interested, my book will be coming out in the next couple of months from O'Reilly and covers all of this depth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:22):
Yeah, is there a date specifically people should watch out for?

Camille Fournier (01:12:25):
I think it's actually pre-order on Amazon now. It's called Platform Engineering, and then, there's ... I think it's like a guide for technical product and people leaders, something like that. But I think the release ... I don't know exactly when the Kindle release will be, but we're still in copy edits, but it should be done pretty soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):
Okay, amazing. So you can pre-order it now. Rolling to it obviously in the show notes and description, it's called Platform Engineering. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, I want to take us to a recurring segment on this podcast that I call AI Corner. AI is very top of mind for a lot of people and I'm always curious how people are finding it valuable in their work or in their life. So the question is there anything you've found AI to be helpful with ... in your AI work? Any way you use it in an interesting way?

Camille Fournier (01:13:11):
I find it helpful, for example, if I've written a sentence and I'm like, I like this sentence, but I feel like, I don't like the phrasing or the format that I've used, it needs to be edited, but I can't quite figure out how. I will often put it into ChatGPT and be like, "Can you reframe this? Can you rephrase this for me?" It doesn't always work well, but sometimes it does. It's like, "Oh yeah, if I just switched this around or changed this word choice, it's a much easier to read sentence." I do think it's ... I think it's just before that and small. I think it's large, lots of texts I haven't had as much luck with. I'm a little bit of an AI novice still, I would say.

(01:13:52):
What I will say is that AI is really bad, if you try to ask it for quotes or at least ChatGPT is. I haven't used a lot of the other ones that much. I actually saw there was some Twitter or some social media thing that's like, did Francis Ford Coppola get fake reviews from ChatGPT of the new, what is it, Agopolus.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:14):
Yeah.

Camille Fournier (01:14:14):
Agopolus maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:14):
Yeah.

Camille Fournier (01:14:16):
And I was like, I actually had that scenario where I was like, I need a quote ... I was looking for quotes for the book and I was like, maybe ChatGPT knows, but I was like, "Can you give me any good quotes on ..." I forget what it was. Let's just say it was on managing complexity or something like that, and it gave me these really interesting quotes. I was like, that's great, but I better double check that. And they were not real. They were never real, not a single quote. And I'd be like, that's not actually a real quote. Yes, you're right. That's not, so here's a different one.

(01:14:45):
I was like, that's still not a real quote, so don't ask it for quotes because ... or if you do, make sure it's a real quote and not just an interestingly phrased ... I mean good summarization in some ways of the text, it was sort of quoting from, just not an actual quote.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:06):
That's a good reminder of just generally don't assume what it's telling is true. Generally, it's not giving you real things. It's making things up and usually they're right, but often they might not be right. That's a really good reminder. On that first tactic, is there a prompt that you find helpful for how to actually feed it in there? Is it just here's a line, help me come up with a better version of it?

Camille Fournier (01:15:26):
No, I have not figured out the prompt engineering thing at all. I tried to get it to summarize a paper for me the other day, and it literally gave me the summary of a different paper, and then I asked friends and they were like, "Well, here's a summary." I was like, "Actually, that seems like a good summary." And they're like, "Well, first I told the AI that it was an expert in the field and that it needed to read carefully and that it was really smart," and I'm just like, how do I have to manage the machine? I already have to manage all of these humans? Why are you making me manage machines now too, please?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:00):
I thought this was going to solve all of our problems. Yeah, that role. There's an acronym for how to approach engineering, and there's always like give it the role. Here's the role you're going to play for me. You are an amazing writer and here's what I want from you. Yeah. I'm also very bad at it. By the way, Claude I here is really good at writing. That's one of its superpowers, so if you want to try writing, that's worth trying. Claude by Anthropic. On the second point you made of fake quote. So, yeah, Francis Ford Coppola is coming out with this movie with ... As you mentioned, this trailer is just full of all these quotes that people supposedly said about all his other movies that Godfather and stuff. And they're all like, these are terrible ... They're all terribly mean quotes about his movies.

(01:16:41):
It turns out, yeah, they're all not real quotes, and they actually took down the trailer, I just read because he's just making up quotes by famous critics.

Camille Fournier (01:16:49):
Well, so maybe-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:50):
Maybe it was ChatGPT.

Camille Fournier (01:16:54):
You can get fooled. I don't know if it was ChatGPT or a cheeky intern or something, but we can get-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):
Or very intentional marketing stint.

Camille Fournier (01:17:04):
Or that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):
Yeah. Anyway, with that Camille, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Camille Fournier (01:17:08):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):
Amazing. Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Camille Fournier (01:17:15):
So the first one is, What Got You Here Won't Get You There. I love it. I think anybody who is trying to challenge themselves and grow, should read it, it's fantastic. The second one is called When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron. That is when you are ... For me anyway, when I am struggling with whatever circumstances around me, I find it a very soothing or reminder that life is hard and the best way to ... you just sort of have to breathe with it and be with it and let it remind you of how life is hard for everyone and sort of make you a kinder person in the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):
Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Camille Fournier (01:18:08):
I loved Alien Romulus. It was great. If you like a scary alien movie, fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
I hate scary movies, so that's a new Alien movie. Okay.

Camille Fournier (01:18:18):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:18):
Anyone know there was a new Alien movie.

Camille Fournier (01:18:19):
I loved it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):
Awesome. Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's an app or even physical product?

Camille Fournier (01:18:27):
So I don't know about recent, I'm a big Whoop fan. I got it during the pandemic and it is one of my ... I'm just a weird fan girl for it. I don't know. I just really ... I enjoy it. I use it every day. Maybe it's totally inaccurate, but it seems accurate enough and I just find it a very interesting and cool product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:48):
I know Whoop product, people listen to this podcast, so I think they'll be happy to hear that. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, find useful and work around life?

Camille Fournier (01:18:59):
If you don't challenge yourself, if you don't take risks, you'll never grow. That's a big one. I think you've got to ... challenging yourself, taking risks is how you grow. I think the other one for me is stay curious. The more you can remember that there's more that you don't know than that you do know, and staying open-minded and being willing to be wrong, I think the happier you'll be and the better you'll be as a leader for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):
Final question, on the topic of working out, you're blocking it with your head generally during the podcast, when we moved ... Behind you is a very significant looking barbell set or dumbbell set, I don't know which one is which. Talk about your workout regimen or anything along the lines of how you work out.

Camille Fournier (01:19:48):
I have been lifting rates probably for longer than some of your podcast listeners have been alive, which says more about my age than anything else. So I used be ... I now have two kids, so I lift weights as sort of maintenance, but I used to be a very ... I could deadlift than twice my body weight and I was just a very, very strong person. Now of course, everybody is into weightlifting, which makes the gym really annoying. So partly why I have a set in here, a small set with a baby sized bar is ... so when I can't make it to the gym, I can at least lift a little bit at home.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):
What's your favorite workout, lifting wise?

Camille Fournier (01:20:29):
I love really basic deadlift, squat, overhead press, that kind of very simple, the classic lifts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:39):
Amazing. Camille, this is awesome. As everything, I was hoping it'd be, we covered so much stuff. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, follow up on stuff and check out your books and how can listeners be useful to you?

Camille Fournier (01:20:51):
Yes, so with the weird state of social media now, that's actually a harder question to answer than it normally is. I am on LinkedIn, so you can always follow me on LinkedIn and I'll probably ... I haven't traditionally put that much there, but I'm expecting I'll probably start putting more there in the coming months. I also still use Medium when I write. I actually like Medium, so medium.com, scamille is my username. Those are two good ways. I have a Twitter/X account that it is currently locked, and I may or may not unlock it at some point, but social media, as I said, has gotten weird. So I think probably LinkedIn is the easiest way for this kind of stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
And I read somewhere that scamille is rooted in your love of ska music back when you were younger. Is that right?

Camille Fournier (01:21:39):
It's true, yes. It was from high school. I was a big ska fan.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:43):
It's funny how our usernames just stick from, we were really young and that's the way we're represented online now forever.

Camille Fournier (01:21:49):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):
That's absurd. And then, you didn't answer my final question, which is how can listeners be useful to you?

Camille Fournier (01:21:55):
I have a new book coming out. I have another book that I've already written. Obviously, I love it when people buy my books so I love when people share my books with other people. My first book is translated into a bunch of languages, which is super exciting, and I hope that if you read it and enjoy it and learn something from it, you will let me know. Tag me on some social media. I think that's just awesome and stay tuned. Look, if you are looking for people potentially to come talk to your company about platform engineering, I could be interested in that, but I always love to meet interesting people. If you're in New York, reach out, who knows. This has been an amazing, amazing time getting to chat with you, Lenny. Thank you so much for inviting me on the show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
I feel the same way. Thank you for agreeing to come on the show, Camille, you're awesome. Thank you so much for being here.

Camille Fournier (01:22:48):
Take care.

# Monetizing passions, scaling marketplaces, and stories from a creator economy vet | Camille Hearst

## Transcript

Camille Hearst (00:00:00):
... those Steve Jobs' lore was that if you were in an elevator with him, you better be prepared to talk about what you do at the company because he had a habit of getting in the elevator and looking at you and saying, "What do you do? What do you do here?" And there were also rumors that people who had not given him a good answer, that ended up being their last day at Apple.

(00:00:23):
So there was someone who I didn't know personally but worked in my department before I got there who got in an elevator and looked up and Steve was approaching him and so he went to press the button to open the door and accidentally pressed the one to close the door. And it was like doing this press... You can't see me if you're listening on podcast but frantically pressing the button, trying to open the door, but accidentally pressing the closed door button and the elevator going to its destination. And apparently he got off and just bolted straight up, ran down the hallway.

Lenny (00:01:00):
He'll never remember my face.

Camille Hearst (00:01:02):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:01:02):
I disappeared.

(00:01:07):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

(00:01:15):
Today my guest is Camille Hearst. Camille is head of fan monetization at Spotify. Before that, she was head of product for creators of Patreon. She was product marketing manager at YouTube and the second PM on iTunes. She's also a former founder. She started a company called Kit that she sold to Patreon.

(00:01:31):
And this episode is for anyone who's curious about the creator space, either from the creator side or the platform side, or if you'd just like to hear a bunch of fun stories from an awesome product leader.

(00:01:42):
We chat about the future of creator platforms, how to be successful as a creator, and also as a new creator platform, the downsides of creator life plus frameworks, stories from Steve Jobs, ways to monetize being a creator and so much more.

(00:01:56):
Enjoy this episode with Camille Hearst after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:02):

This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient.

(00:03:15):
I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrinkle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors.

(00:03:25):
More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:03:43):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place.

(00:04:24):
Camille, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Camille Hearst (00:04:28):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:29):
I first wanted to just give a big thank you to Adam Fishman for introducing us who had just so many nice things to say about you and so I'm really excited to be chatting.

(00:04:38):
I want to start with talking about your current role at Spotify and I believe your role is head of fan monetization. What does that actually entail and what are you responsible for within Spotify?

Camille Hearst (00:04:49):
As head of fan monetization, I have a team of folks who are really passionate about figuring out new ways to help artists and fans connect and also figure out ways to make those connections result in new monetization opportunities for the artists.

(00:05:08):
So one of the things that we all know and we've seen is how passionate fans are about the artists that they love. You've been following any of the latest bits about the Taylor Swift tour, the Beyoncé tour that's been happening this summer, and their effect on local economies. It's been pretty impressive.

(00:05:28):
But one of the things that we also know is it's not just the big huge superstars who have those rabid and super engaged fan bases. People are really passionate just about supporting the artists that they love in general.

(00:05:40):
And on Spotify, we want to figure out ways we can help that result in more money that goes directly to the artist.

Lenny (00:05:48):
What are some of those ways just to give people a sense of what might be happening?

Camille Hearst (00:05:52):
So one of the ones that most mature is merch which is funny to say because most people probably don't realize that you can purchase merch on Spotify. That's one that's been around-

Lenny (00:06:03):
I did not realize that.

Camille Hearst (00:06:04):
... for a bit of time and my team's recently been working on making it more prominent, giving artists more ways to offer that merch in the form of a reward for fans. So things like an exclusive discount or an exclusive design or early access because you're a top listener on Spotify, really thinking about thank yous and rewards for your Spotify listenership and fandom.

(00:06:28):
And then other things we've been looking at have been listening parties. We ran a few of those over the past year. I think I talked about it actually on a Spotify event a few years ago. We were running... Sorry, it wasn't a few years ago, it was last year.

(00:06:45):
But listening parties is another way and then we've got some new ideas we're exploring.

Lenny (00:06:50):
I've heard people do listening parties with this podcast actually and I hope that you roll that out to podcast too because that would be very cool.

Camille Hearst (00:06:58):
Yeah. We have all kinds of ideas of really interesting ways we can bring groups of people together and get the monetization going.

Lenny (00:07:08):
All right.

Camille Hearst (00:07:08):
One day.

Lenny (00:07:09):
Mysterious but exciting.

(00:07:11):
Speaking of Taylor Swift, I was watching a TikTok the other day and they showed a video of someone inside the concert showing the whole concert and then they panned to the parking lot and there was just tens of thousands of people just standing around in the parking lot listening to the second order music out at the stadium. And I wonder how can you monetize that if there's an opportunity?

Camille Hearst (00:07:34):
Yeah. I think they often have the merch trucks in those parking lots though one way-

Lenny (00:07:38):
Probably unofficial merch.

Camille Hearst (00:07:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:07:40):
So you work with artists and I actually wanted to ask this question. What's the best part about working with artists, musical artists, and what's the worst part?

Camille Hearst (00:07:48):
I think the best part is working with people who really lean into their creativity and their passion so much so that they do it for a living. And I think a lot of us have creative pursuit and passions and things we love to do and if we made millions of dollars and could retire, what would you do full time? Usually, it's one of these pursuits. But I think it takes an element of bravery, not to mention talent, but you really have to go out on a limb.

(00:08:18):
And so that's this equality that exists in this group of people and it's fun to be around and feel that rub off on you and think, "Oh, maybe I could take the dive one day and I don't know, go do my calligraphy or learn my ukulele and then do it full time." But that's the best part.

(00:08:35):
And the thing I'm really... I grew up in a musical household. My dad's a drummer although his joke when we were growing up was real musicians have day jobs because he had to actually have a job with benefit to support the family and couldn't just be gigging full time.

(00:08:55):
Which actually brings me to the flip side of the question which you asked what is the hardest part. I do think we saw this a lot at Patreon and I think you see it especially with musicians and artists, this feeling that you want to give your fans everything that you create and you want to do it for free because you're so enamored with this idea that people really love you and want to support you and they're really responding to your creativity and everything that you're making, you don't want to charge them. But what comes with that is, well, how are you going to make a living.

(00:09:29):
To some degree, there has to be a value exchange that happens in order for a creative person to live from their art.

(00:09:37):
And I've found that that's much more pronounced with musicians, this starving artist ethos which makes what I'm trying to do actually quite difficult because a lot of the feedback we get is, "Oh, that's awesome. I want to have a listening party and have everything be free and just have everyone show up and don't sell anything." And we're really looking at it as a way to fans want to support the artists they love, they want to open up their wallets.

(00:10:04):
You've see nothing else from a Substack and Patreons that people are actually really happy to be a patron of the arts and they look at it as like a badge of honor.

(00:10:12):
But musicians in particular I think tend to shy away from that which makes the kind of thing that I'm working on more difficult.

Lenny (00:10:20):
This's a great segue to an area I want to spend time on is the creator economy and creators and artists and things like that. And along these lines, I think I have this issue too. I feel bad charging people but there's also... I don't think my stuff is worth enough to charge for and why would anyone ever pay anything for it and so I imagine you see that too. It's just like, "No one's going to pay for this. It's crazy."

Camille Hearst (00:10:40):
Yeah. It's funny because we live in a very capitalist and market dictate the price kind of society, but on an individual level, particularly when the commodity so to speak is art, there's so many emotions and feelings involved in that that it's hard for someone who's the creator to disassociate themselves from it and see what the market will bear.

(00:11:05):
Which is why I actually think it's great that there's platforms who have stepped in and said, "Hey, we see an opportunity. Let us insert ourselves in the center, let us aggregate, and let us do the hard work of pricing and payment and tax and finance and actually create value where it would be really hard for an individual person who's a creator to do all of this work and facilitate that connection." It's almost like the perfect marketplace solution.

(00:11:38):
But again, it's hard because if the supplier doesn't want to actually make money in some cases or shies away from optimizing or making money.

(00:11:47):
And then there's the creative process. Sometimes, you're in a flow mode and you're producing a lot and then other times, you're in a drought spell and these things ebb and flow which is why I think companies like Patreon and Substack are really cool because what they try to do is smooth out that revenue and make it so an artist can actually have a predictable... They're not even artist, a creator can have a predictable sustainable paycheck so that they aren't bouncing around from job to job and losing the ability to have that burst of creativity because they're worried about their bills.

Lenny (00:12:22):
I have that experience myself with Substack which is a subscription newsletter and one of the big downsides people don't think about with this life is once you start charging, people start buying, say, an annual subscription and that means I have to at least go for another year and in reality, I never really want to stop it because the revenue would just stop and that would be really sad. So you get on the treadmill where you don't really have an exit path. And I'm not sure exactly where this all goes, but it's been great. But that's something people don't think a lot about is this never ending, keep creating, keep creating life.

Camille Hearst (00:12:52):
We call it internally the hamster wheel of content creation. You get on because you love it and then how do you get off.

(00:12:59):
So it's actually an interesting challenge again for platforms to think about where can they add value, are there ways to either make the content creation process that much easier and I don't want to say less of a burden because it's not a burden but sometimes, if you don't have time or you're just at a point in life where you can't do it, are there services or things that can be offered, are there things like financing that makes sense for creators that banks or traditional institutions wouldn't offer because of just the difference in the type of work that's being produced.

(00:13:34):
Or another potential solution is are there ways that platforms can create content. Maybe it's automated so that the creator can take a break. So maybe they're not AI necessarily, maybe it's more just aggregating data or doing summaries or maybe there's just other ideas that haven't been explored out there. But it's a real problem.

Lenny (00:13:56):
So I have this lennybot.com site which is an AI chatbot based on all my content including the podcast episodes and actually, an engineer who was listening to this podcast reached out and offered to help me build it and he did and it's awesome. And I'm curious if that becomes my retirement plan as the bot ends up just doing this and learns enough. I highly doubt it, but it's fun to experiment with.

Camille Hearst (00:14:18):
Yeah. Use your own content as your large language model, right?

Lenny (00:14:22):
Exactly. That's exactly what it is. And I'm curious where this goes.

(00:14:26):
I want to follow the thread of the creator economy. It feels like there's this huge wave of the creator economies, the future of work, and all these platforms launched to allow creator to make money. But it feels like over the past couple of years, it feels like it faded away. And these very small number of platforms essentially one YouTube, Spotify, Instagram, TikTok, Patreon, maybe Substack, and there was also the sense that the future of work is freelance, everyone's going to be working for themselves, creating stuff, and it feels like people are still working regular jobs. A lot of these startups haven't done great.

(00:15:01):
So I guess I'm just curious what you think happens maybe in the next five or 10 years from a perspective of platforms emerging and also just from creators, what... Do you think things stay the same? Do you think there's another wave? Where do you think things go?

Camille Hearst (00:15:14):
I think it was probably predictable to some degree that platforms would win because just of the nature of aggregation. Once you have either all of the supply or you've aggregated the demand, it's really a strong network effect. Why investors love to invest in these types of businesses, it's hard to break out.

(00:15:37):
I wouldn't underestimate the strategic ability either of some the big platforms. They were definitely thinking ahead and building features and thinking about whether or not they saw it as a monetization opportunity. It certainly is a great strategic play to make sure that creators felt like they were on the platform that made the most sense for them and they weren't going to churn or leave or try too many other places out.

(00:16:04):
So I think the rush and the funding was to figure out is there room for any other new platforms, are there specific vertical that maybe there's an opportunity to create vertical specific features and tooling.

(00:16:19):
And actually, I think we saw a huge massive creation there in Twitch, right? Twitch did not exist and they're just a juggernaut.

(00:16:26):
I think TikTok is another one that came out of this era. Maybe they weren't positioned as creator economy type startups but effectively...

(00:16:35):
Did you see what happened in Union Square here with Kai, the gaming streamer?

Lenny (00:16:39):
No.

Camille Hearst (00:16:39):
So I'm in New York and last week, there was a mob and a riot because a Twitch streamer announced that he was going to be giving away PlayStations and computer gear in Union Square and something like a million teenage boys showed up. I'm not making this up. And they had to shut down the center of New York City to clear what turned into protest, riot, mob-

Lenny (00:17:07):
Holy shit.

Camille Hearst (00:17:08):
... of teenagers who came for this one creator that probably no one listening to me right now has even heard of.

Lenny (00:17:15):
Yeah.

Camille Hearst (00:17:17):
So I do think a lot of the predictions have come to bear. There are tons of people making money and making a living from creating content on the internet.

(00:17:28):
There have been studies too where they ask young people what they want to do and what they want to be when they grow up, we quote these at, excuse me, Patreon and over 60% want to create content for a living.

(00:17:42):
So those trends I don't think are going anywhere. Maybe it'll be supplemental income, maybe it'll be something you do for a period of your life. But I do think that this area continues to be untapped. I just don't see a world where...

(00:17:58):
I think of Michelle Phan, right? She's basically a mini Disney and when you think of it like that, she's created IP. What can you do with IP? Comic books, movies, TV shows, plushies, merch. How many millions of Michelle fans are we going to have seen?

(00:18:16):
Look at what's happening in China. There's tons of creators like this.

(00:18:20):
So whether or not the VCs have won or the startups have succeeded, there's no way that you can lower the cost of content creation and increase the scale of distribution and not see this emerge, this creator economy I think emerge. But I think that maybe there's still opportunity for more companies to blossom and to grow and certainly for more individuals maybe do this, figure it out on their own, and do it without too many big platforms getting paid off of their creative pursuit.

Lenny (00:18:58):
Have you seen the NPC trend on TikTok/maybe Instagram Reels where people pretend to be NPCs, non-playable characters, from a video game?

Camille Hearst (00:19:06):
I have not.

Lenny (00:19:07):
Okay. It's crazy. People just pretend to be a computer character and people pay them little gifts to do a thing.

Camille Hearst (00:19:15):
Oh. Is this the... Yes. Have seen it. [inaudible 00:19:19] ice cream, ice cream.

Lenny (00:19:22):
Yeah, exactly.

Camille Hearst (00:19:22):
Yes. I didn't realize.

Lenny (00:19:24):
You're making tens of thousands of dollars a day just... So that's one way to make a living.

Camille Hearst (00:19:24):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:19:30):
On the thread of becoming a creator, you've seen a lot of creators try to do this on Patreon, back at Apple even with iTunes, I want to chat about that, at Spotify now, and even your startup. I'm curious what you've seen is important to success in the creator life, especially things that are maybe not obvious to people. What do people need to get right if they want to pursue that path?

Camille Hearst (00:19:54):
One of the things that I've seen that I don't know if people realize is consistency and predictability of content creation which is where this idea that we were talking about earlier of a hamster wheel kind of comes on.

(00:20:08):
But there is something to churning out consistent quality work and putting it out there for your audience to consume and respond and react to that goes a long way. It's almost like the 10,000 hours. You have to do 10,000 hours of something in order to truly master it. But I've seen that time and again.

(00:20:30):
I started at YouTube in, let's see, how old am I? It must have been 2010. And that was when I really think this whole thing was just first getting going. And we used to put together these playbooks of what made a creator successful because a lot of the effort there was trying to support this burgeoning economy. And I remember even back then in 2010 and to this day, that continues to be one of the top pieces of advice.

(00:20:57):
Another one is collaboration. So working with other great creators, sharing audience, exposing one another to those audiences, and then this was something we tried to employ at my startup, Kit. We would actually host events for creators to get together to facilitate meeting and cross pollination in the hopes that it would just benefit their careers. If they were doing YouTube videos with someone they met at the party, then it would be great for all parties all around. So those are two things.

(00:21:32):
And then I do think in a world with all of this content, there continues to be a need and a space for the curator. And curators as creator's kind of an interesting concept. But a curator is almost like what the role at book publishing company plays or a record label plays or a radio station plays, right?

(00:21:56):
There is a degree of having a brand, having something you stand for, having a vibe or an ethos and that person being almost, not a gatekeeper in a bad way, but like, "I, Camille, can't consume anywhere near all this content. You, I trust your vibe. Tell me what I should be listening to." And so that would be the third thing I would say is figure out who are those curators who you really can associate your content with who are on the same page as you, have an audience who you think would like your stuff and just try and get associated with them.

Lenny (00:22:30):
Yeah. The last piece is so... I totally see that all the time. If there's someone I super respect and they recommend something, I'm obviously going to value that recommendation highly. That's like we're influencing emerged from organically, right? People just, "Here's something you should check out," and then, "Oh, let's pay you to share things so that people try our product."

Camille Hearst (00:22:48):
That was the exact concept behind my startup, Kit. It was all about curating, finding people who are great recommenders for gear, having them curate that gear, and then you could follow the curators you love who wants to go look on Amazon and see reviews from people you've never heard of. Oftentimes, if it's your brother-in-law who's a great cyclist and they say, "Buy this," you just buy it. You don't even care what the reviews say because you trust that person.

Lenny (00:23:14):
What happened with the startup and what did you learn from that experience?

Camille Hearst (00:23:17):
I started working on the startup in 2015. We managed to raise some money, raised over $2 million, which is a huge accomplishment, especially if you know anything about venture capital. They have a horrible track record when it comes to funding people of color, women, people who are non-cisgender white male, just the track record.

(00:23:43):
And we had an amazing experience building this company over several years, grew a bunch of the key metrics up into the right and got to a point where we were trying to figure out what the next move was and should we get a bridge round. We were trying to raise Series A. We were, I think, early on the creator economy trend. Probably about a year and a half later, it would've been, I think, I hope a snap to raise money. But anyway, we were battling a bunch of different choices, different options.

(00:24:19):
And I actually did this startup accelerator called StartX that's run out of Stanford which is my alma mater. And we learned a lot about how to sell a company and what M&A looks like. So we started exploring that path.

(00:24:34):
And in the end, it made the most sense for us to have an exit and join forces with Patreon. And so that's what we ended up doing. Sold the company in 2018, joined Patreon, worked there a couple of years, and that's where I met Adam.

Lenny (00:24:49):
Amazing. And I wanted to ask actually about that experience of selling a company. There's a lot of people listening right now who are thinking about selling their company or maybe you hope to sell their company someday, and I think there's a reality of it and then there's the idea of how it might go. I'm curious what you've taken away from that experience. And I guess specifically is there any advice you could share with folks that are thinking about selling their company someday? What you think maybe could have done earlier or also just share a glimpse of the reality of acquisitions?

Camille Hearst (00:25:20):
I think it's different for every company for sure. Some companies get souped in and get bought. And other companies actively sell themselves.

(00:25:31):
We are definitely in the latter camp which means that we manage a process. It's similar to how you manage a process for fundraising. Not every company just meets the VC and raises money on the first try. They go through a process and meet tons of VCs and put them through the funnel and end up on the other side hopefully with a successful round. So I think that's one takeaway is treat it like a process and manage it like a process if it is something you're interested in. It doesn't really just... For most companies, I would say it doesn't just happen.

(00:26:04):
And then the second piece of advice I would give I think we should have been talking to potential acquirers from the beginning and sharing our vision and what we were trying to accomplish because we started those quite late in our journey as a company and it just meant it took... When I met a potential CPO, who would acquire the company, who would end up being my boss or CEO, it was their first time meeting me whereas if it had been their fifth time, we would've had a relationship established and they would've known more about the vision and what we're trying to do and hopefully, would've had some more time to think about it.

(00:26:42):
So those would be my two pieces of advice. Start preparing to sell your company from the moment you found it which is a weird thing because obviously, if you're starting a company, for most founders, they want it to be the next big thing, they're not starting it in order to sell it, but it's a good thing to have on your radar because you never know what the future holds. And then two is to treat it like a process.

Lenny (00:27:07):
Yeah. On that piece of knowing people who may acquire you, I found that to be a thousand percent true. We sold our company the Airbnb and that's how it got to Airbnb and what I realized is you just need people who may buy you in the future to have you in their head when they have a problem so that they could be like, "Oh, Camille and her team could solve this problem for us. Let's go chat with her and-

Camille Hearst (00:27:28):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:27:28):
... see if they're interested in acquisition."

(00:27:31):
And on the process piece too, 1000% resonates. We basically... When we started chatting with a company, we're just like, "Okay, who else could potentially acquire us? Let's make a big list and who we can talk to at that company as soon as possible and then just explore." But it's more challenging there because it's you reaching out to them being like, "Hey, you want to chat about buying our company," versus them reaching out to you. So to your point, always goes better if they reach out to you, but you can't always control that.

Camille Hearst (00:27:54):
Right. Or if the meeting is not under the context of buying it all, it's like, "We're working on something cool. We have a great vision. It aligns with what you're doing. Maybe there's a partnership here," versus just tell you what we're doing and then when I contact you in 12 months about buying me, you've heard of me before.

Lenny (00:28:12):
I find even when you're starting to chat about acquisitions, you never want to say directly, "Hey, you want to buy us?" It's like, "Hey, you want to have a strategic partnership of some kind? You want to explore partnership?" So funny.

Camille Hearst (00:28:23):
Like dating.

Lenny (00:28:24):
Yeah, yeah. You can't just be too direct sometimes.

(00:28:28):
So when you got to Patreon, I don't know if it was immediate or eventually you ended up leading the creator side of the marketplace, and I find that looking at your background, you basically stayed on the supply side of marketplaces through your career mostly.

(00:28:43):
And I actually did the same thing. All I worked on at Airbnb especially, or mostly, was the host side.

(00:28:48):
And I think it takes a specific mindset in person to be excited about that side of the marketplace versus the consumer side which is where everyone always generally wants to go, to the customer side. So I'm curious what it is that's drawn you to that side of the business across all the places you work and then just what you found to be important to be successful in that role and on that side?

Camille Hearst (00:29:09):
What drew me to that side of the business probably was maybe accidental at the beginning. Just again, coming from this musical family and background, I always had a natural interest in helping artists make a living. So I think that interest was there.

(00:29:29):
At Apple, I did... There were only two PMs there. We did everything.

(00:29:34):
At YouTube, I accidentally ended up in creator.

(00:29:39):
But where I started understanding deeply the dynamics of the marketplace was actually my experience and the one job I've had that not been in the creator or art or these big consumer platforms or creator economy which was at a startup called Hailo based out of London and at the time was a huge competitor to Uber and Lyft in the ride sharing and ride hailing space and I worked on the supply side making sure that there were enough cars to fuel the demand.

(00:30:17):
And in a marketplace like that where it's real time people trying to get a cab to go from uptown to downtown, you see the inexperience firsthand the impact to your business if you don't have suppliers, if your suppliers aren't happy, if they go on strike, if there's regulations that mean you can't use your service. And there I think I was...

(00:30:44):
So one of the projects that I worked on that I launched was the U.S. Uber competitor because Hailo in Europe was all about getting taxi cabs and did not play in the livery is what it's called in New York or the private rides. Basically, it's like your uncle or your aunt or your cousin who can switch on Lyft and go pick up whoever. That just was not a thing in Europe.

(00:31:09):
And so we had to figure out how to launch that in the U.S., how to get drivers on how to create this supply and it was like it doesn't matter how nice the user experience is, how great the marketing is, how much demand you can generate if when someone opens that app, there are no cars available.

(00:31:31):
So a lot of people talk about marketplaces as chicken and egg. I actually just think they're two-sided and you start with the supply and at the end of the day, you can optimize for the demand side or choose who you're going to prioritize in terms of if there's a conflict, we're going to pick this side or the other.

(00:31:53):
And yes, you won't be successful with one side or the other but I just experienced and lived firsthand the pain of having built this great operations back in that fed into this gray UI and then you open that app and you can't get a ride because there aren't enough cars available.

(00:32:12):
So I think that solidified my feeling that with marketplaces, you can't lose sight of the solving real pain points and needs for the supply side in order to make sure the entire business can operate.

Lenny (00:32:26):
I've done a bunch of research into marketplaces and I found basically the same thing, that supply is almost always where you need to focus almost all your time especially at the beginning.

(00:32:34):
The way I think about it is that's if you have a store that's stuff on your shelves and you're not going to have a business if you don't have anything on the shelves.

Camille Hearst (00:32:41):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:32:42):
There's a few rare cases, I forget exactly which they were, where demand was actually the bigger challenge and supply is really easy.

(00:32:47):
You know what? It was Rover. Rover had no problem it turns out with supply because who wouldn't want to make 50 bucks watching a dog for a few hours. It was a really easy sell and a lot of people could do it and wanted to do it so they actually found supply was not an issue.

(00:33:01):
But in most cases exactly how you said most 10 times supply is what people are looking for.

Camille Hearst (00:33:05):
Totally.

(00:33:06):
I find that the counter example I hear a lot is eBay, how they were so good at aggregating demand, they were basically able to force suppliers to the terms that they like. But I can't imagine... It'd be interesting to talk to some folks who were at eBay in their early days that the whole thing didn't start up without them going out and figuring out who are the key suppliers we need to get on this thing so that we can get aggregating demand.

Lenny (00:33:32):
Yeah. You got to have some good stuff on eBay. I wonder if Beanie Babies or whatever they started with.

Camille Hearst (00:33:37):
Yeah, exactly.

(00:34:37):
You mentioned Apple and I want to spend a little time there. So you said you were the second PM on iTunes back in the day and I'm curious what you learned from the experience you had working at Apple. I think I read somewhere you worked maybe closely with Steve Jobs and Jony Ive, but I don't know if that's true, but I'm curious just... No? Okay, but you do have a Steve Jobs story?

Camille Hearst (00:34:57):
Yes.

Lenny (00:34:58):
Okay.

Camille Hearst (00:35:00):
Yes. So I was very early on in the iTunes days I started interning there when I came out of grad school and my internship was actually in label relation and then I started a full-time job doing product marketing.

(00:35:17):
And at Apple at the time, I think even to this day, they didn't have a product manager title, they had product marketing managers. And so one of my colleagues who remains good friends to this day, Steve was the first also named Steve, not Steve Jobs was the first PMM working on iTunes and he primarily was doing all the client stuff. He launched the store and everything. But I think I was the second person in the iTunes group with that title. So that was really cool.

(00:35:44):
And then as far as the Steve Jobs story, I would think I mentioned to you people like hearing this story, nothing happened, I just went up to him and said, "Hi, I'll tell the story."

(00:35:53):
But I think the context of why people find it interesting is because of other stories about Steve. So let me give a little context.

(00:36:01):
Those Steve Jobs lore was that if you were in an elevator with him, you better be prepared to talk about what you do at the company because he had a habit of getting in the elevator and looking at you and saying, "What do you do? What do you do here?" And there were also rumors that people who had not given him a good answer that ended up being their last day at Apple.

(00:36:24):
So there was someone who I didn't know personally but worked in my department before I got there who got in an elevator and looked up and Steve was approaching him. And so he went to press the button to open the door and accidentally press the one to close the door and was doing this press... You can't see me if you're listening on podcast but frantically pressing the button, trying to open the door, but accidentally pressing the close door button and the elevator going to its destination. And apparently he got off and just bolted straight up, ran down the hallway.

Lenny (00:37:02):
He'll never remember my face.

Camille Hearst (00:37:03):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:37:04):
I disappeared.

Camille Hearst (00:37:04):
So that's the context.

(00:37:07):
So in 2005, it's my first day of my internship at Apple and I had this situation where I attended graduation because I only had one semester left to go back to, so I just decided to attend the graduation. That happened basically the week before. And for those of you who are the job span, this is when he gave his really inspiring and famous Stanford commencement speech and it's an awesome, awesome thing to listen to.

Lenny (00:37:41):
You were at that speech?

Camille Hearst (00:37:42):
I was there, yeah.

Lenny (00:37:42):
Whoa. People love that speech.

Camille Hearst (00:37:47):
It's a good one. It's really-

Lenny (00:37:48):
What did you feel being there listening to it in the moment?

Camille Hearst (00:37:51):
Totally inspired.

(00:37:54):
Apple was not quite what it is today in terms of brand and influence and just it's at the peak. It's really come a long way. It was still when I met the recruiter at a conference, I was like, "Apple? What do they do again? My roommate had a Mac, but what's iTunes? Oh, yeah, I think I've heard of that. I think..."

(00:38:19):
The dancing iPod silhouette ads which really sent Apple over the top. Those hadn't even really dropped yet, but it was starting, right? It was starting to percolate and bubble and you heard more and more about it and just the association with music was making Apple more cool.

(00:38:35):
But that speech is... Talk about a commencement speech. That is top-notch.

(00:38:41):
And Steve's great at those. He was phenomenal storyteller.

(00:38:44):
So graduation is what? Saturday, I go home Sunday. The Monday I started my internship and here we are at Cafe Max with my new coworkers and Steve is sitting literally at the table next to me. And so I was like, "Oh my gosh, there's Steve. I would love to say hi and introduce myself and everyone at the table."

(00:39:09):
Now mind you, I hadn't heard this story about the elevator button in the full yet because it was my first day, but they're all looking at each other. They're like, "Yeah, go say hi to him if you want, but you're an intern." They say, "Hopefully, he doesn't fire you on your first day."

(00:39:22):
But I've always, in my family and in my life, had this encouragement to say hi to people when you see them and let them know that you appreciate what they do and just thank them because it doesn't happen often.

(00:39:39):
A lot of times, people go and they ask for a picture or an autograph but this idea of just introducing yourself, saying hello, and thanking someone for something that they've done that impacted you to something that's been a way that my parents have encouraged me to behave in the world and something that I saw them do and saw them model because probably, again, coming from my dad being a musician and being fans of other musicians that like a thing in music, the artist culture that talked to one another about how something you created influenced you or whatnot.

(00:40:09):
So I went up to him and I got up from my lunch table and walked over and I said, "Hi, my name's Camille. I'm interning here this summer. It's my first day. I was at graduation at Stanford on Saturday and your speech was amazing. I was really inspired. I'm so excited to be here and so excited to work on this company and I just wanted to say thank you for spending your time doing that speech for us on Saturday."

(00:40:38):
And he was like, "Who are you? What? You're an intern? Well, what are you doing here?" It was a little... We had a little bit of an exchange. I had to clarify like, "Yeah, I graduated, but I'm interning and I have another semester left." And he was like, "Oh, okay. Well, welcome to Apple and good luck and I hope you have a really great experience this summer." And that was it. I didn't get fired and I said hello to Steve.

(00:41:01):
And after that, I felt like I knew him. Every time, I'd see him around campus I'd wave high and I think he had no idea who I was but he would look at me confused and then wave back hello.

Lenny (00:41:12):
"She's so friendly. Who's this person?"

Camille Hearst (00:41:14):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:41:15):
Do you still remember how you would've described what you do? I have a feeling it's seared in your head, but if not, then never mind.

Camille Hearst (00:41:21):
Oh, my statement, if he had asked me where [inaudible 00:41:23].

Lenny (00:41:23):
Yeah, exactly.

Camille Hearst (00:41:24):
Well, yeah, I was lucky because one of the things that I did he would actually know exactly what it is which is I would manage press rooms whenever there was an iTunes launch. So this is very much grunt work.

(00:41:38):
But when there would be a press event for one of the new iTunes 6 launch or whatever, they would have interviews with Walter Isaacson or I don't know if Kara Swisher was working back then, but whoever the journalist and Steve would have a room set up with an iMac computer with an iTunes library full of track. There would be whatever the new iPod was synced to that computer and all of the track. And after every interview, everything would have to be reset.

(00:42:10):
Also, the library was crafted so he would give feedback for months on the content of the library because he would do demos. And so he wanted to know, "Make sure all my favorite tracks are in there, my favorite Beatles records, my favorite Bob Dylan records, and who's this artist? Let me check them out. Okay, they don't cross the bar. Oh, what's this song? Oh, I love this song. Oh, add this." So he was very involved in the entire presentation and someone had to go do all that.

(00:42:38):
So who better than the fresh out of masters of engineering in Stanford graduate student to go do all of the grunt work of making library? But those are the kinds of details that he paid attention to. And so I would've just told him that I did product marketing and one of my main responsibilities was fixing the press room for him and he would've been like, "Oh, okay."

Lenny (00:43:01):
You mentioned that your title is product marketing manager and there was a recent kind of a hubbub on Twitter where Brian Chesky at Airbnb shared that they shifted the role of product manager to essentially the Apple model. And I'm curious what your perspective is on that approach to product, the Apple kind of way versus a traditional product manager?

Camille Hearst (00:43:21):
They have done this very intentionally from what I've seen. I know they hired Hiroki actually from Apple-

Lenny (00:43:29):
Yeah. A lot of Apple people.

Camille Hearst (00:43:31):
Yeah. And actually one of the new leaders they've hired, I don't know if you know Judson Coplan, dear friend of mine, we interned that same summer at Apple and he worked there for 15 years before heading over to Airbnb.

(00:43:45):
But yeah, the Apple construct, it's much more of design and engineering led organizations, craftspeople I would say more so than strategy people. So that was one of the stark differences I saw in my transition from Apple to Google. There are a lot more like people from Coca-Cola and McKinsey and Bain at Google. I don't think any of those people even existed at Apple.

(00:44:15):
And it was very much like, "Let's 3D chess our way into what our next move is going to be." Whereas at Apple it was, "Let's tinker and let's craft and let's build and let's see what feels right." There's different approaches. As a result, the approach to product management was quite different.

(00:44:33):
So I think it makes sense. Brian Chesky's background is a designer so it probably resonates a bit more within the Apple way.

(00:44:41):
And then in terms of what it means for product managers on an individual level, so again, there weren't product managers, the closest thing would've been CPMs, technical program managers who help manage the sprints and manage the schedule and listing out what features would happen.

(00:44:59):
I spent a lot of my time with the incredibly talented design team and if I had ideas of product features or... We would think months ahead of time, like what's the anchor story or what are the three key messages for the launch of iTunes 10 or whatever and we might have ideas for new features that would go in that.

(00:45:19):
But because we had that moment in time, we knew well ahead we were planning for and you were working on the messaging and working on the consumer positioning again while in advance of anything actually being live or built. That was what framed what features you wanted to build and what problems you would put on the table to be solved as opposed to as clear cut metric you're trying to drive forward which is how product management has evolved in another capacity.

Lenny (00:45:52):
And that's how it works at most companies.

Camille Hearst (00:45:52):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:45:54):
I want to come back actually to the creator economy stuff. I feel like you've worked in the creator economy longer than most anyone, and so I wanted to use our time to spend a little more time there. What about on the platform side? If someone were thinking about starting a company to cater to creators, to build a new platform maybe for creators to make a living, do you have any advice for them? Where do you think maybe there's opportunity? Where do you think it's like, "No, probably you don't want to spend time here?"

Camille Hearst (00:46:24):
I think with any company, solving a real problem is the most important thing. So creators have lots of challenges and things that can be solved. Some painful things are more acutely felt than others.

(00:46:40):
I think at the core, every creator needs two things. They need to grow an audience and they need to get paid so that they can make a living. And in some ways, I do think that growing an audience is more important because with that audience, it opens up opportunities in ways that you can monetize.

(00:46:59):
But there are all kinds of other things like we're talking about financing, health insurance, the list goes on, things we face as human beings, trying to be freelancers in the world often apply equally to people who are creative for a living.

(00:47:14):
And then there are unique things about the creator space like the spurts of energy, the spurts of creative flow that maybe don't apply in a salary job or an hourly job.

(00:47:28):
So there are lots of problems out there still to be solved for creators. I don't think that this space is nearly solved, done, stick a fork in it. So my advice would be to look at the problems that exist and pick a real one and go for it.

Lenny (00:47:47):
Wise advice.

(00:47:49):
Have you seen this podcaster, Bobbi, I forget her last name, she rocketed up to the fourth biggest podcast in America with a few episodes of her podcast, she interviews Drake and a few comedians. Have you seen this person?

Camille Hearst (00:48:05):
I feel like I should, but as we said at the beginning, I'm such a music head, I don't listen to any podcast.

Lenny (00:48:11):
The reason I thought of her is I was watching a clip of her on an interview show and she hasn't made any money from this even though she's got the hottest podcast in America right now, and we're going to link to her in the show notes, but she's hilarious.

Camille Hearst (00:48:25):
Amazing.

Lenny (00:48:25):
There's something about her that just is really fun to watch. But okay, no podcast for you right now. We'll get you on a podcast. You're on the podcast.

Camille Hearst (00:48:32):
I'm on a podcast now.

Lenny (00:48:34):
There we go.

(00:48:36):
You've mentioned your parents and I was reading your Wikipedia page and the way your parents are described on there is radical Buddhist artists technologists. I'm curious what that means maybe and then also just is there a memory or moment of growing up that highlights that aspect of them?

Camille Hearst (00:48:56):
What's funny about this is I had no idea how to Wikipedia page until you sent that.

Lenny (00:48:56):
What?

Camille Hearst (00:48:56):
I don't know where it came from.

Lenny (00:48:56):
Oh my God. Who made this?

Camille Hearst (00:48:56):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:48:56):
That's amazing.

Camille Hearst (00:49:08):
Like, "What? I'm on Wikipedia?" So that was funny.

Lenny (00:49:08):
That's crazy.

Camille Hearst (00:49:13):
Yeah.

(00:49:13):
So let's see. I grew up in San Francisco in the eighties and nineties. My parents started practicing Buddhism on the East Coast in the seventies. And my dad was, I mentioned he's a drummer and a musician, and he also had a studio. We had this closet under the stairs that he turned into a production studio and he was an artist.

(00:49:43):
He worked for the city. My mom worked for the city, didn't have a ton of money growing up, and so a lot of the computer equipment came from the street. He would find... Somebody put a PC out... He was building PCs before the gamers were doing it. And I remember he would come home with boxes and boards and chips and would literally go get a book from the library or the store and would figure out how to assemble these computers, keyboards that were broken. He would just fix them. Probably should have been a mechanical engineer, super talented at this stuff.

(00:50:15):
But basically he had this entire production studio with drum machines and all the equipment. And I was his helper. So I would help him solder stuff together and tinker and actually put these computers together. So that's probably... I don't know where that quote came from. I'll have to go click the link of what the reference is from, but that's some of the background there.

(00:50:42):
And the other thing that happened back in San Francisco in the eighties and nineties, we used to host Buddhist meetings in our house and back then there was a lot of what was called street propagation like the Hare Krishna used to be up and down Haight Street right around the corner for me.

(00:51:01):
The Nation of Islam, which my brother joined for a period of time, would be selling Final Calls and bean pie brothers on the corners.

Lenny (00:51:09):
Yes.

Camille Hearst (00:51:10):
So The Final Call is the newspaper at the time for the Nation of Islam.

(00:51:15):
And so it was just a different era, completely different from today, and us practicing Nichiren Buddhism, we had pamphlet that said, "Nam myoho renge kyo," on them, and I would stand on the steps of our house and... We had a gate. So I would stand behind the gate and I'm probably seven or eight years old, just ask people walking by, "Hey, if you're a nam myoho renge kyo, here's a pamphlet. Learn a little more. We're having a meeting at our house."

(00:51:40):
I'd laugh with my mom now. She's like, "I can't believe we're doing that." It seems totally crazy now but at the time, it was just, again, coming off of the seventies, it was a very different era.

(00:51:49):
If you've ever seen What's Love Got To Do With It, Tina Turner's probably... Who recently passed away, probably one of the more famous, more well-known practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism and she actually started practicing in the same kind of era, seventies and eighties... Or seventies probably.

(00:52:05):
So that's what that means. And those are a couple memories that illustrate that moment. But you can see, music, technology, helping creators get paid, it's certainly influenced everything about how I am today.

Lenny (00:52:20):
That was a perfect description of your parents based on those stories. And it feels inevitable that you would've ended up doing what you're doing now. Product, technology, music, artists, creators. So that's amazing.

(00:52:33):
I'm going to ask one more question before we get to our very exciting lightning round, and the question is just around frameworks. Is there just a favorite framework or process or system or approach to building product or teams that you come back to and/or to share often that you think might be useful to listeners?

Camille Hearst (00:52:51):
I have this great manager in my experience at Hailo who turned me on to Marty Cagan who I since befriended and learned a ton from. And I just love the way that-

Lenny (00:52:51):
Really?

Camille Hearst (00:53:03):
Yeah, he's awesome. Actually, I should ask him about early days at eBay because I think he was there probably one of the people who got off the ground.

(00:53:12):
But one of the things that I learned and that we really emphasized during that time is this idea of having dual track agile going where you're doing discovery and delivery simultaneously and doing it in a way that's not waterfall.

(00:53:29):
It's not like, "All right, the designers are going to go over here and tinker for months, and then once we've figured it out, we'll lob it over the wall to the coders and cross our fingers and hope everything works." But rather having this continuous cycle of essentially de-risking your assumption and getting to a point where you're able to do that with speed so that you can chart your way to new paths and to innovation by constantly figuring out where the errors are in your thinking or where things that you didn't expect to happen were going to happen.

(00:54:04):
So I think everyone knows an impact effort or risk reward two by two and can map out different opportunities and things you might do on that two by two.

(00:54:16):
But one of my favorite takeaways from that is that from this way of working around this dual track agile de-risking your riskiest ideas first approach is a concept of taking the things in the top, the biggest swing and actually prioritizing those first in terms of product discovery and figuring out what can you do to start de-risking because if you constantly put those off in favor of the lower risk or more predictable smaller swings, how are you ever going to truly innovate and get to the next level.

(00:54:53):
It's a less safe choice. So it's someone that as a leader, you are in the hot seat and you can take accountability. So if some of these things don't pan out, it's on you and not on your team and give your team permission to fail and try things and de-risk those risky assumptions and get them to a point where they become low risk and they become predictable and you can just put them in the delivery column and execute them.

Lenny (00:55:18):
It reminds me of this piece of advice that people call eat the frog which is first thing in the morning eat the frog which essentially is do the hardest thing first and then there's the day becomes easier.

Camille Hearst (00:55:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:30):
I don't know why it's eat a frog, I don't know where that comes from.

Camille Hearst (00:55:34):
I don't know either. I like draw the owl. That's one of my favorite values, the Twilio ones.

Lenny (00:55:39):
Say more. I would say more. What is that?

Camille Hearst (00:55:44):
Companies have their values. One of them is draw the owl. It's really draw the effing owl and the meme is how do you draw an owl and you draw some circles and then you draw a fucking owl. So it's like just do it. At some point, you got to just figure it out and figure out how to do it.

(00:56:10):
Excuse my language, but it's funnier when you say what the value actually is which is sometimes you got to just go for it. You're not going to know the exact path to get there and maybe you won't have de-risked everything but you start with some circles and then you get it done.

Lenny (00:56:27):
I love it. Cursing is very loud on this podcast, so I'm glad you went there.

(00:56:32):
And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Camille Hearst (00:56:36):
I hope so. I didn't prepare this. I thought I'd figured out on the spot.

Lenny (00:56:40):
Great. Perfect.

(00:56:41):
What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Camille Hearst (00:56:46):
Three-Body Problem, A Wrinkle in Time, and Octavia Butler's Kindred.

Lenny (00:56:53):
Three-Body Problem's come up a number of times recently and there's a show coming out actually based on the book.

Camille Hearst (00:56:58):
I'm excited. Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:59):
I'm so excited. I've been watching Foundation which is also another series I've been excited to see, but it's like, I don't know what's going on. It's so complicated.

Camille Hearst (00:57:07):
How is it? I've been waiting...

Lenny (00:57:08):
Eh.

Camille Hearst (00:57:08):
So I'm a huge sci-fi head. I watched Battlestar Galactica. Classic. [inaudible 00:57:16] and so I've been waiting to see what happens with Foundation because I just don't have that kind of commitment in me these days.

Lenny (00:57:23):
Yeah. I don't know what to think of it. It's beautiful and there's a lot of interesting pieces but it just goes out... I think they're making a lot of stuff up. I don't know if you've read Silo. Have you read Silo?

Camille Hearst (00:57:33):
No. But I saw the preview for the show. Another one I'm going to [inaudible 00:57:36] season two.

Lenny (00:57:37):
That's a good one to read because in the show... They're just making up stories. I don't know what they're doing. There's... Ninety percent of it, they just totally invent for the show and then there's a little bit that's connected to the story so I don't know what's going on.

Camille Hearst (00:57:49):
Okay. Cool. I didn't even know it was a book. I'll read it.

Lenny (00:57:51):
Oh, yeah. It's really good. There's three of them, but the first one's the only good one, so I found.

Camille Hearst (00:57:54):
Okay.

Lenny (00:57:55):
Anyway, moving on. Speaking of this topic actually, any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you've really enjoyed?

Camille Hearst (00:58:02):
I've been watching Hijack over the last week with Idris Elba. So that's been fun. Got a couple episodes left there.

(00:58:10):
And then movies, I'm a huge Chris Nolan fan. So I haven't seen Oppenheimer yet, but can't wait to see it. Most of his movies I'm confused by, but the visuals are just so stunning if you let it go.

Lenny (00:58:24):
Yeah. I'm excited to see it too. I've not seen it either. Have a new child and it's harder to see movies [inaudible 00:58:30].

Camille Hearst (00:58:30):
Oh, another good one. Shadow and Bone on Netflix.

Lenny (00:58:34):
Shadow and Bone?

Camille Hearst (00:58:35):
Way better than the book I have to say. Well, I read one series, the Six of Crows. This is my young adult sci-fi fantasy streak. Again, coming to the forth. But the show is incredible. It is so good. So if you're into-

Lenny (00:58:35):
Really? Never heard that.

Camille Hearst (00:58:48):
... this kind of vibe, go for it.

Lenny (00:58:51):
Okay. I'm going to check that out.

(00:58:52):
What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?

Camille Hearst (00:58:58):
I like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished and take me through the process and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.

Lenny (00:59:23):
What is a favorite life motto that you just really like to share or often come back to either in work or in life?

Camille Hearst (00:59:31):
Yeah. So there's one which is actually a Japanese proverb. I took Japanese in high school and college but this phrase is a frog in a well cannot know the ocean. And so the idea is to push yourself to expand your limits and your horizons and get out of the well so that you can experience the ocean.

Lenny (00:59:31):
I love that.

Camille Hearst (00:59:55):
I got a better one, sorry.

Lenny (00:59:57):
Okay, great. Go.

Camille Hearst (00:59:58):
Another one.

Lenny (00:59:58):
Sure. Tell me.

Camille Hearst (01:00:00):
I learned this one from someone at Patreon because someone was posting this around the streets of San Francisco. It's become more known recently. Apparently, it's a Chinese proverb. I don't know if it's true or not but it is that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now. So this idea that don't delay, maybe you missed the prime opportunity but waiting any longer certainly isn't going to help.

Lenny (01:00:28):
I heard that one actually I was at the park in San Francisco and there was this piano thing, I think it was called, it's a botanical garden and people play piano all throughout once a year. And there's a guy that was just playing incredibly well and I left and he left around the same time and I was standing next to him. I'm like, "Man, I wish I studied piano when I was younger." And he's like, "The best time to have studied piano is 10 years ago. The second best time is to start now."

Camille Hearst (01:00:51):
Yep, he's right.

Lenny (01:00:53):
And I couldn't get off the hook there. He is like, "You're right. And you're still not going to do it I guess."

(01:00:59):
Final question, who's a favorite artist right now? Who are you liking?

Camille Hearst (01:01:05):
Ooh. So I've been for probably a good three years now really into Afrobeat and right now there's this artist called Rema, R-E-M-A, who I first heard a couple years ago, he's got this track called Dumebi. But he has a song out right now that is, my opinion, song of the summer called Calm Down. I think Ariana Grande, is it, came over and did a verse on it? But I've just been listening to Rema Radio, Calm Down radio on Spotify and tons of Afrobeats artists. So that's the vibe I'm on right now.

Lenny (01:01:42):
I love it. I actually... Once someone suggested some music at the end of a podcast and I was just like, "Hey, we're going to end the podcast with that tune." And it turned out we did that and then YouTube shut us down because it's copyrighted and so I'm not going to offer. Never going to do that again, so we're just ending with regular music but we'll link-

Camille Hearst (01:01:59):
[inaudible 01:01:59] it's hard.

Lenny (01:02:00):
I know. It's so tough. Come on. It's just like a few seconds. Give us a break.

Camille Hearst (01:02:06):
You should have 30 seconds for your play. Right?

Lenny (01:02:06):
I don't know. Maybe we'll-

Camille Hearst (01:02:07):
Don't ask me, I'm not a lawyer.

Lenny (01:02:10):
We'll send you the bill.

Camille Hearst (01:02:11):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:12):
Camille, this was amazing. I think we're living the creator economy here. I really appreciate you making time for this.

(01:02:17):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask any additional questions? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Camille Hearst (01:02:24):
I used to be real big on Twitter but that ship has sailed. I'm still on there. You can find me-

Lenny (01:02:30):
It's X now.

Camille Hearst (01:02:31):
Yes, on X. Camillionz is my handle, C-A-M-I-L-L-I-O-N-Z. Also on Threads these days, trying that out, seeing if that sticks. So probably LinkedIn. You could find me on LinkedIn. I don't think anyone ever promotes that.

Lenny (01:02:31):
They do. Most people actually.

Camille Hearst (01:02:48):
Do they? Yeah?

Lenny (01:02:48):
Yeah.

Camille Hearst (01:02:52):
Okay.

(01:02:52):
And how can listeners be useful to me? Hey, go support your favorite creator. Find out, go to the show, find out if they have a Patreon. I would love to see more and more people feeling like they are patrons of the arts.

Lenny (01:03:08):
Amazing. Maybe buy some merch.

Camille Hearst (01:03:09):
Buy some merch. Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:12):
Camille, thank you again for being here.

# How to achieve hypergrowth in your business and career | Carilu Dietrich (Atlassian)

## Transcript

Carilu Dietrich (00:00:00):
In order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company. The biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use, right? I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. 

(00:00:22):
And then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. Hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years, right? They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200. They're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth, because it's going to be here before you know it.

Lenny (00:00:55):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard work, experiences building and growing today's most successful products. 

(00:01:04):
Today my guest is Carilu Dietrich. Carilu is a former CMO and has advised the CEOs and CMOs of hypergrowth B2B companies like Segment, Miro, 1Password, Bill.com, Productboard, Sprout Social, Weights & Biases, and most notably was head of marketing at Atlassian through their IPO. 

(00:01:22):
In today's episode, we cover what hypergrowth companies have in common, how to make big changes to your growth strategy to unlock new channels of growth, why COs don't trust CMOs, and why most CMOs get fired. Also, why most CPOs get fired. Plus, the benefits of waiting a long time to hire your first salesperson, bundling strategy, and a ton of incredibly insightful career advice. A huge thank you to Elena Verna for suggesting Carilu for the podcast. And with that, I bring you Carilu Dietrich after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:56):
This episode is brought to you by Rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago, and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain.

(00:02:18):
Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools, and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter. Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce, or HubSpot directly into rows. And when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read, and embed charts, tables, and calculators into Notion, Confluence, or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:03:08):
This episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster. Let's be honest, it's a lot of work to build a company. And if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to be able to hire the right talent quickly and confidently. Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network where you can find, hire, and manage high quality contractors in engineering, design, and product, for a fraction of the cost of agencies.

(00:03:36):
Brain Trust charges a flat rate of only 10%, unlike agency fees of up to 70%. So you can make your budget go four times further. Plus, they're the only network that takes 0% of what the talent makes, so they're able to attract and retain the world's best tech talent. Take it from DoorDash, Airbnb, Plaid, and hundreds of other high growth startups that have shaved their hiring process for months to weeks at less than a quarter of the cost by hiring through Braintrust's network of 20,000 high quality vetted candidates ready to work. Whether you're looking to fill in gaps, upskill your staff, or build a team for that dream project that finally got funded, contact Braintrust and you'll get matched with three candidates in just 48 hours. Visit usebraintrust.com/lenny or find them in my show notes for today's episode. That's used usebraintrust.com/lenny, for when you need talent yesterday. 

(00:04:31):
Carilu, welcome to the podcast. 

Carilu Dietrich (00:04:33):
Thanks, Lenny. Happy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:35):
You've had this incredible career. You worked at all these incredible companies. I'd love to just dissect what you have found to be most important and effective in building a career long term, just broadly. And then specifically if you're trying to get to an executive role someday, what have you found to be some more important habits, behaviors, tactics, lessons?

Carilu Dietrich (00:04:55):
I'll start by saying that everyone has their own calculus about the trade-offs they want to make on pursuing their career and the sacrifices they might need to make versus the other things in their life, their family, their hobbies, their passions. And so I think the executive track isn't for everyone because there are a lot of trade-offs.

(00:05:14):
Because I think that some of the most important aspects of getting to the executive suite are working harder, learning more, pushing yourself, taking on more responsibilities and opportunities, maybe even in the white space, that aren't your job or aren't in your regular time. 

(00:05:34):
When I was young in my career, I decided I wanted to be a CMO. And at the job where I had decided I wanted to be the CMO, I worked two hours later than everyone else on the team. And I had this thought in my brain that two hours every day for five years would get me how many more years of experience than someone else? And I could do that when I was young, and I didn't have kids, and I was willing to make those sacrifices. 

(00:05:59):
But you look at a lot of the top CMOs and they have sacrificed a lot of things to read all of the books. And again, if I go back to that first job, I was a PR manager, and we went through a tough phase and we lost a ahead of product right before the major launch of a major product. So I volunteered to moonlight in the product department and run the beta, and do release engineering. And taking on other responsibilities gave me insights into other departments that made me more successful, early in my career and later on.

(00:06:33):
And the same thing happens as you're growing, right? If a department head leaves and you can spend extra time doing your own job and being the interim for this other function, you can really show the top executives that you have the appetite and the skill to take on more responsibility.

(00:06:50):
So I think learning as much as you can about your expertise, working really hard, and taking on more responsibilities, and having a great attitude and a strategic mind are probably what I think helps people get to the C-suite on the personal level. And then I have another set of five things that are what specific ways do you need to train your mind?

Lenny (00:07:15):
I know there's this backlash against working really hard that happened for a while, but I'm on the same boat as you have of success will come from working really hard. And sometimes that sucks, but that's usually how it goes.

Carilu Dietrich (00:07:27):
I think there's ebbs and flows in your life. You're going to have a baby here soon, congratulations. Thank you. And so maybe you take your foot off the gas for a little bit. But really, there's no shortcuts. There's no shortcuts to knowing a lot.

(00:07:43):
One of the people I admire most is Tomasz Tunguz, who was with Redpoint and now started his own VC firm. And I was talking to him about his blog and he was like, "I'd just wake up 5:00 or 6:00 AM every morning and write three to four blogs a week for 10 years." Damn. That is self-discipline and insight and drive. So yeah, no shortcuts. I think. You look at Denise Persson at Snowflake, and she's worked really hard to get there. 

(00:08:12):
So the five things I think you need to do to get to the C-suite that are not personal side are you need to think about how your responsibilities tie to revenue. You need to think and talk in the terms of the CEO and the board. And that can be tricky when you're junior because you don't have exposure to it. But getting a strong handle on finance, and how the finances of the business work, and how the revenue of the business works.

(00:08:38):
I went on a tour of the Tesla factory with my daughter's field trip a couple weeks ago. And the guy who was giving us the tour was like, "So I delivered and stocked all these different parts at the plant and then I would take a list. And after work every night, I'd go to each part of the plant and try to figure out what they were working on and what the challenges and opportunities were. And that's how I moved up."

(00:09:00):
So it's just understanding how the whole thing works together. Because if you want to be in the C-suite, it's a job about how the system works. So I really encourage tours of duty between different departments. I told you about my tour of duty and product. I thought CMOs had to do every function, so I took a tour of duty in every function in marketing, but really getting a sense for other departments.

(00:09:23):
The next thing is the relationships. So building really strong relationships with people by doing good work and helping them. And then the last thing I think is the quality of the companies you work for. So your career and your ability to transcend, which is really moving faster than other people to get bigger jobs, is fairly dependent on the momentum of your company. 

(00:09:49):
So I was a leader at Oracle for five years, and my team grew from five to seven over five years. And I was a leader at Atlassian for four years, and my team grew from 15 to 100. And so if you pick the right company with the right momentum, you have a better chance of getting higher level experiences and accelerated career growth.

(00:10:14):
And then I guess one little footnote. If you pick great companies, great people work for those companies, and go out and work at other companies and also give you opportunities. So I ended up at Atlassian kind of in a stroke of good luck because I had worked for Jay Simons, the president, at two companies before. So the quality of the first company, Plumtree, really helped propel my whole career.

Lenny (00:10:40):
There's so many things I want to double click on there. The last piece, it's the advice I always give people when they're early in their career is to go find a company that's going to do super well. That one experience is going to transform your entire career. Having the logo on your resume, the people you meet, the experience you get financially. But that begs the question, how do you find that? How do you pick a company? I think in your advising today, you join later where it's a little more obvious. "Okay, they're doing great." Do you have any advice or lessons about how to identify earlier where to go work and how to be lucky in that pick?

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:16):
Isn't that the billion-dollar question? So I worked for-

Lenny (00:11:20):
For investing too.

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:20):
Yeah. I worked at Atlassian, which was phenomenal. Then I worked for Classy, which was a company that helped nonprofits raise money. 

Lenny (00:11:29):
I've used that product.

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:31):
Thank you. And we were acquired by GoFundMe. And it was fine, but it was no Atlassian. And then I spent the next five years trying to figure out, how do you pick your next Atlassian? So my advice would be for people earlier in their careers, it's easy to pick the winners if you go work for a big company that's a winner. I would love to work for Tesla, or AWS. Or right this second, I would die kill for a job at OpenAI. You know some of the big companies that are successful... Salesforce has totally been a career maker to so many top executives.

(00:12:04):
So early in your career, working for big name high momentum companies. I think you can't wimp out. You've got to want it and go for it. And maybe you apply year after year, and you meet people, and you try for it early in your company.

(00:12:19):
Later in your career, I think what you just said, picking later stage versus earlier stage gives you a better view of their momentum. I actually have a Post-it note, got it here, about what I look for. 10 parts of what would evaluate to see-

Lenny (00:12:35):
You just have that Post-it note around?

Carilu Dietrich (00:12:37):
I do. It's one of five Post-it notes on my board.

Lenny (00:12:37):
I want to hear what the rest are too. But keep going.

Carilu Dietrich (00:12:44):
I have to look at it for advisory. I only take eight to 10 clients. I'm always full. And so it has to be a phenomenal company. So how do I know if it's a phenomenal company? Here's my list. Rule of 40, which is your profitability and your costs together. The quality of the investors. Are they really top tier investors? Are they mid tier or some you've never heard of? Investors do a lot of due diligence, but you also want to look at their most recent rounds, because they could have phenomenal early stage and have slowed down. I think the later the size, the more reliable, because they've just made it farther. 

(00:13:23):
Their Net Promoter Score or their customer satisfaction. Do people really rapidly love this product or is it like meh? Their net dollar retention, which is, how fast is their revenue growing? And I should have it on my Post-it note, but Snowflake was the benchmark. I think they were growing at 142%.

Lenny (00:13:44):
I think at one point it was 180, whatever.

Carilu Dietrich (00:13:46):
Yeah. That sounds right. 180, 165. Net dollar retention, if you have a customer and they just renew at the same dollar rate, it would be 100. So 180 is almost doubling just their customers. So they didn't even need new customers, almost doubled their business. A phenomenal net dollar retention means it's a really strong healthy business. 

(00:14:09):
I looked at their growth rate last year, their burn rate, are they going to run out of money? And then ideally, are they number one in their market? Do they have a Forrester or a Gartner Magic Quadrant? People tell you if they're number one. 

(00:14:22):
And then the last thing is I look at their Glassdoor. Is it just a bad place to work and where people unhappy? Because they don't actually survive as long as companies where people are happier.

Lenny (00:14:34):
I love this list. You should turn it into a blog post, and there's another idea for you. Can you share what the other Post-its are around you? Even broadly.

Carilu Dietrich (00:14:41):
I can. One says, "More Yoda, less Wonder Woman," which basically is ask better questions. The second one was-

Lenny (00:14:51):
Ask them backwards too.

Carilu Dietrich (00:14:52):
Yeah, right? Ask them backwards. Which is funny, because the other Yoda thing I have up Is... Here wait. "Do or do not. There is no try." Backwards. I have another one that says, "Hell yes or no." When opportunities come to you and you're like, "Should I do this or should I not do this?" You only have so much time in your life. And so if it's not something that really excites you and gives you energy, it's tough to be the best at it. And so hell yes or no.

(00:15:26):
And then the last one is, "Worrying is wasted energy," because I think we live in this economic pressure cooker, and there's a lot of fear and uncertainty. But we just need to take that fear and uncertainty and thank it for giving us urgency. And then make the list of what can we control now and what should we do next.

Lenny (00:15:50):
That's actually a perfect segue to my next question. And by the way, that was amazing. I'm glad that I asked about your Post-its. That's a whole life philosophy right there in Post-its.

Carilu Dietrich (00:15:59):
Yeah, I should do a BeReal. This is what is looks like at this side. These are all the Post-its.

Lenny (00:16:05):
Okay. So the question is around, I don't know if we're technically in a recession, but maybe we're on the verge of recession. The market's not great. And a lot of people are being laid off, or have been laid off, or are worried about being laid off, or just graduating college and looking for jobs. And I'm curious if you have advice for people trying to find a job in this market or just generally trying to accelerate their career. What is your advice for just how to deal with this environment while also trying to advance your career?

Carilu Dietrich (00:16:32):
I'd like to take in two parts. One is if you're unemployed and one is you're in a job. So if you're unemployed, it's tough. It's a tough time. There's a lot of supply. And so I think you just really need endurance and grit. And the sticker worrying is wasted energy, because you will get another job. It's just going to be a little bit more of a bumpy ride than some other years.

(00:16:55):
And the best executives I know have had down periods in their careers, where they were out of work for a while, where they were fired by a CEO, who this or that. And what they have in common is endurance. They're just back in the ring. So I think it's important to not lose endurance. 

(00:17:15):
It's also important not to settle on a crappy job or a crappy company. Each job you have prepares you for the next job, and each logo you have prepares you for the next job.

(00:17:27):
So I'd spent a lot of my career trying to also chase waves. My first job in college, I was in nonprofit, and then I wrote a book on the giving programs of the top 50 tech companies. And I realized that tech companies had a bunch of money in 1999, and were giving it away to charities. And I wanted to go into tech, because that's where the growth and money was. And I thought I could give it back to the world and good, but I could be inside the bubble. 

(00:17:55):
And then within tech, I moved my way to B2B. And within B2B, I moved my way to SaaS. And within SaaS, I've moved my way into dev tools, and collaboration, and now AI. 

(00:18:05):
There's this book called The Millionaire Next Door, which talks about how the very best antique store makes one or 2% profit. And the very worst oil and gas company makes 35% profit. And we know that some of the worst software companies make 65% profit. 

(00:18:25):
So picking your industry will propel your career, and picking the right company will propel your career, and then doing a good job will propel your career. So I think that there's no magic bullet to getting a job. But working your network, sticking with it, and continuing to grow your skills are the three most important things.

Lenny (00:18:43):
Big part of this conclusion is don't feel like your career needs to slow down in this period.

Carilu Dietrich (00:18:49):
And I think if you're in a job, some of my greatest career growth came in the economic downturns. In the 2000s, in the 2008. Because other people take their foot off the gas, and you can put your foot down. If you're willing to learn more, hit yourself into new roles or new responsibilities that no one's covering at your company. When they don't hire tons of people for everything, there's lots of open projects where you can raise your hand and grow. You just can't be as focused on title and salary right now. You're kind of building up value that you'll be able to monetize on the other end of this recession or downturn.

Lenny (00:19:26):
Let's segue to chatting about growth. And I thought it'd be fun to start with your story of running some very expensive ad campaigns. I know the founders are always kind of flirting with this idea of buying a bunch of billboards, running TV ads, maybe subway ads and bus ads. And you've done a lot of that and you've spent a lot of money doing that, and particularly non-digital advertising. And so I'm curious what you've learned from your experience and approach to this sort of marketing spend.

Carilu Dietrich (00:19:53):
Yes. I've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it actually. I ran global awareness advertising for Oracle, and did all of the airports, and the front page of the Wall Street Journal, on the back page of The Economist, and take over in the middle of Salesforce in downtown San Francisco. And we did the Ironman movie sponsorships, and the sports teams and arena sponsorships.

Lenny (00:20:16):
That sounds very expensive.

Carilu Dietrich (00:20:17):
Super expensive. And then Atlassian to a lesser degree, we spent several million dollars on different awareness campaigns to get chat noticed, or to associate Jira with the Atlassian brand. Advertising is sexy and super expensive for the benefits. It's a multi-year benefit of awareness. People have to see things many times, and it has to really resonate with them. 

(00:20:45):
So my advice to founders is that the most important thing is the quality of your product. Oracle spent a ton of money, and people still didn't like us in a lot of ways because they had poor experiences with the salespeople, or they didn't like Larry, or the product had kind of languished since it had been acquired by the company. So your product has to really be fantastic. And then also to do good brand advertising, it has to be sustained over a long period of time.

(00:21:14):
So Oracle had the front page of the Wall Street Journal, back page of The Economist, this boring advertising template with the red bar, but it made it memorable. We would do market tests, and two or three or 10 times more people would recognize the Oracle brand without the logo, because of the consistency versus SAP or or IBM. 

(00:21:35):
So you really need to be thoughtful about spending consistently over a longer period of time, and a smaller amount on a fewer number of things can be really effective. So Snowflake, for instance, has always gotten credit for doing a billboard on 101, and people think they do lots of advertising. But for many years, it was only the billboard on 101. It was just sustained and strategic.

Lenny (00:21:59):
So I guess two things that I take away from that is one, you can spend a lot of money, and if your product's not actually incredible, it's not really going to do much. And correct me if I'm wrong. And then two is sometimes, just one very targeted spend is worth a lot more than just blanketing a bunch of ads.

Carilu Dietrich (00:22:16):
Absolutely. I was telling you a story that at Atlassian, we did a big advertising campaign on our HipChat product, which was head-to-head with Slack, and it was an Office Space spoof with Bill Lumbergh. But the product had some uptime issues, and some feature issues, and Slack pulled ahead, and the advertising wasn't what would've made it or broken the product. It's really the product experience, and the advertising just amplifies.

Lenny (00:22:42):
I think you also shared with me this HipChat ad, that's maybe my favorite billboard ever. And I don't even know why looking back, but it made me laugh so hard. Back in the day, it was this meme of some early meme stick figure guy saying, "Why you no use HipChat?" Looking back I'm like, "Okay. I don't know how funny." But I think in the moment that was a really popular meme, and it really stuck with me.

Carilu Dietrich (00:23:04):
Well if you think about the best advertising, it's something that has a little twist of humor, or personality, or truth that sticks in your brain. So yes, that was a successful advertising. And kudos to my team, because of course I don't write it myself as the head of marketing. But yeah.

(00:23:22):
And some of my other favorite ads are also others that highlight the customer. So New Relic did an advertising campaign around data nerds. When data nerds were not really popular, they were still nerds. And they had these tattoos that said nerd life, and they featured customers on billboards talking about cool data nerds. And some of those campaigns that really stand out have something that's funny, unexpected, and then true to the product.

Lenny (00:23:54):
I remember those, one of the ads featured, our CTO at Airbnb, Mike Curtis, and everyone was very excited to see his face on the Billboards.

Carilu Dietrich (00:24:02):
Yeah, Salesforce has done a great job with those over the years too, really highlighting the customers.

Lenny (00:24:06):
So zooming out a little bit, you specialize working with companies that are going through hypergrowth. And you've worked with companies like Miro, Segment, Bill.com, which I don't know if people know is just a massive, massive business. And also 1Password. 

(00:24:21):
And on the topic of 1Password, interestingly I didn't realize how big and how fast 1Password has been growing. And just last week I saw this report from Okta where they have all this interesting data about which products people are using, and they put out this report showing which products you're getting the most new customers. And then on a different axis, which companies are getting the most users per new customer. 

(00:24:46):
And there's this six companies in this quadrant. Figma, Miro, Snowflake, Sentry, HubSpot, and 1Password, which blew my mind. And interestingly, you work with two of them. And so all that to say, what have you noticed about what is most in common with companies that are going through hypergrowth? What is most in common in terms of what has contributed to them being that successful?

Carilu Dietrich (00:25:08):
The biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use. I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. So Miro, whiteboards were the number one most uploaded asset in Jira forever. Because people all get together and they write their ideas on a whiteboard, and then they need to remember it and iterate on it. And that bringing that concept to life just hit a cord that people wanted to use. And when one person uses it, another person uses it.

(00:25:42):
1Password similarly, I've been a 1Password user for more than 10 years. We used it at Atlassian, as a corporate. And then they have the family plan. So I used it at home and then my dad got elderly, so I had a family that I was the administrator for, and then I go into different companies and you bring it with you.

(00:26:02):
And one of the other companies I advise is Productboard. And I became an advisor of Productboard because 1Password's CPO had it in another company, brought it into 1Password, rolled it out company-wide to get alignment and visibility on the product roadmap. 

(00:26:18):
So in order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company, especially in this economic efficiency market. So has to be an amazing product, has to have some viral activity. So we just talked about Miro or Atlassian. You could have an individual person use it and then they say, "Hey, I'm going to present at this meeting with Miro, come join me on my board. I've got these confluence pages we'd set up as a wiki about these engineering topics, and I want your team to collaborate on them." So those natural points where your users are selling to other people is way more efficient than having sales people that have to sell to other people. 

(00:27:12):
And then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. So hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years. They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200, they're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth. And then the people inside can be homegrown talent, but it's tricky to keep up. 

(00:27:46):
So my whole business is based on people who are trying to be homegrown leaders, but don't know what the next stage of growth looked like. And so a lot of hypergrowth companies hire ahead, hire advisors. Leaders need to really think about mentors and friendships of people who know what great looks like at the next scale, because it's going to be here before you know it. And so I would say those things. Amazing product, viral movement, and company that can ride the lightning.

Lenny (00:28:15):
I imagine founders listening to this that don't have insane virality or huge word of mouth are like, "Is there no path to being a really successful company?" And then I think about companies that did succeed with other channels, like say paid or SEO. And so I guess the question for you is, do you need to grow in this environment, I guess, primarily through word of mouth, organic reality, growth engines? Or do you still see opportunity for companies to grow other ways, say paid, or SEO, or sales eventually?

Carilu Dietrich (00:28:51):
For sure. All of the things are important. I think what I wanted to say first as you were talking was that it's easy to look at a company after they've been viral and be like, "That's amazing." I would like to start a newsletter. I have. It's carilu.com. Lenny has a newsletter. How can I ever grow like Lenny's virality? But Lenny started with one blog, and then another, and the consistency.

(00:29:14):
And when I look back at Atlassian, people would be like, "It must have been so easy to go from 100 to 500 million." And it never felt easy. It was a slog to do exactly what you're talking about. New features, listen to customers, strong SEO. Actually SEO was the number one marketing motion that we used, and SEM. We spent probably between 15 and 25% of our leads from paid search marketing at the time. Now I have a ton of customers that are pretty deep into account-based marketing.

(00:29:49):
Getting to virality and getting the hypergrowth is not a magic bullet. It's consistency, customer obsession, incremental improvements across all parts of the business. So I think founders just need to double down on having a product that's differentiated and does something that their customers really love. And each incremental step is a step forward.

Lenny (00:30:16):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcast, and to coordinate my sponsors. 

(00:30:35):
More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:30:53):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of the special limited time offer just for startups. Plan up today at Coda.io/lenny and get a $1,000 startup credit on your first statement. That's Coda.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.

(00:31:32):
Say that you as a company are seeing word of mouth in some virality, and you want to think about accelerating that, leaning into word of mouth. Obviously you want everyone to be talking about how awesome you are sharing with their friends. Is there anything that you've seen as a good way to lean into word of mouth and accelerate it?

Carilu Dietrich (00:31:49):
I think there's two or three things. One is really empowering the people in your company to be thought leaders. So early days, Atlassian's founders were on all the developer boards. And in fact, I remember, we were maybe 150 million or 200 million, and Scott Farquhar the CEO was still participating and going back and forth in different dev forums when I was like, "I don't know, should we elevate your status? Should we have evangelists and engineers that do this?"

(00:32:18):
And we did, right? And look, one of my clients now is Weights & Biases, the ML ops company helping lots of different AI companies with their ML models. And they have really thoughtful technical people who know more and write more on the blog and engage with their community. And that creates a word of mouth, because they're providing both a product and concepts and learning. That's one of the HubSpot secrets was all of their really thoughtful, helpful content, certifications for marketers.

(00:32:52):
So I think going back to summarize, word of mouth can be driven by thought leadership, which is hiring the right people to really be deeply engaged as super experts. Having a really strong content strategy that's either in communities that already exist, online communities, open source communities.

(00:33:13):
And then third I would say building your own community. So no one sells your product better than your own happy customers. And if I go way back to the very beginning of my career, I worked on a marketing team where I owned demand gen just for net new prospects, and a peer owned demand gen just for existing customer upsell. And we would have different field events.

(00:33:34):
And the existing customer ones were smaller than if we'd invited the prospects and had more buzz. And the prospect ones were very salesy. Whereas if we brought them together and you had customers talking to each other and prospects listening, everyone had a better time.

(00:33:48):
So Atlassian, one of our secrets was this amazing user group community where we just paid for beer and a pizza, and we'd facilitate local in-city leaders, and people would meet up and talk about our products, and talk about development generally, and grow their careers and grow their network. So I think those are the three. The right people, the right content, and the right communities.

Lenny (00:34:11):
As you were talking, I was reminded, I was just chatting with the founder of Gusto about their journey early on. And he said that for the first 200 customers, he sat there with them running payroll, watching how they react every step of the payroll process and how they feel at every moment. And that was a big part of what helped them build the product that people actually continue using, and love, and stick with. And if it wasn't in person, it was on a phone call. And it's like the epitome of doing things don't scale, just like for hundreds of new customers watching them use your product. Pretty wild.

Carilu Dietrich (00:34:44):
I mean that's the secret. That's the secret sauce. And I've heard some early stage startup advisors say that you should build processes that don't scale first. Because when you're in the super early stage seed A under 10 million, you've really got to go deep at that stage. 

(00:35:04):
And in fact, I see that that's one of the problems that companies experience as they get much bigger, when product managers can't meet with customers, or they get limited customers, or maybe they can only meet with a junior user, only the administrator, and not lots of the users. So that insight into the daily struggles and experience of your customers, it's harder to get as you get bigger I think.

Lenny (00:35:28):
I want to drill into Atlassian. You've brought them up a couple times. You were at Atlassian for a long time. You were there from early days of growth to IPO. And one of the most interesting elements of Atlassian and something that comes up a lot on this podcast is product led growth.

(00:35:44):
And Atlassian I think is one of the most classic examples of a product led growth company. And from what I understand, y'all waited a long time to hire your first salesperson. So my question is what did you learn from that experience about when is the right time to start leaning into sales and hiring sales, and what are the trade-offs of waiting longer or doing it earlier?

Carilu Dietrich (00:36:04):
Atlassian was a super unique company at a super unique point in time, because the founders never took outside money except for one late stage financing to buy out some early employees, to give some liquidity. So we never had VCs or private equity that had a voting share that was significant, that could overrule the founders.

(00:36:28):
So the founders were going through this experiment that turned out to be really successful, where they took all the money they would've spent on a sales org and plowed it into engineering and product. I'm going to pull up a slide here that tells the Atlassian story about the ratio of the sales and marketing to the product and engineering.

Lenny (00:36:46):
Amazing. And by the way, check this out on YouTube if you're listening to this and check out this slide.

Carilu Dietrich (00:36:53):
So this is a representative sample of what we did in Atlassian's history, and what ratios still exist today, even several years later. Where we spend way less on sales and marketing. Marketing spent less than other marketers. And also we had almost no sales org, or a sales org that was really focused on renewals, or now an assisting sales org that's focused more on enterprise. But relative to other companies, a much smaller, much more efficient sales org. And we took all that money and put it into product. So here we're spending two times, three times as many dollars in R&D as many other companies that we'd benchmark against to make a product that really sold itself.

Lenny (00:37:37):
It's interesting. So I'm looking at the slide. And again if you're listening, check this on YouTube because it's pretty crazy. This slide of bar chart of spend in sales and marketing and R&D, and Atlassian is the very lowest amount of spend in sales and marketing, and the highest spend in product. And it's interesting that it's from 2020, so it's not even in the early days. It's like still today basically.

Carilu Dietrich (00:37:59):
Right. I'm going to close this down and keep telling you a little bit more about it. There's some unique things that people can take now and incorporate. So the real strategy in sales, sales is the most expensive vehicle, right? Expensive people that spend a lot of time. So the Atlassian model was to sell only to people who were already customers really. If several people or a couple groups had purchased, we'd help them with their renewals. And now in the later incarnations of our sales orgs at Atlassian, it helps a lot more with larger enterprise companies who need enterprise deals, or does more cross-sell and upsell, but doesn't really do prospecting. Net new prospecting is a really expensive way to get new customers.

(00:38:51):
So we see different trends coming now with companies, because almost no one can do pure product led growth. Because your investors want to see accelerated growth, and most people believe that adding an SDR or adding an AE will add a predictable amount of revenue. And so it's difficult because product led growth and sales have to coexist.

(00:39:16):
But the whole transition in marketing that's happening to account-based marketing and intent-based signals is trying to do some of what we were doing at Atlassian, only to engage salespeople with customers that are actually likely to buy. And if you look at other hyper-growth companies, Airtable, Miro, both of those I know from the inside have had strategies where the salespeople really only engage after some threshold has been hit of number of users that have already been paying for the product on their credit card. But sometimes it's a high number of 20, 40 people at an account have to be engaged before a salesperson engages.

Lenny (00:39:54):
Based on that, what is it you recommend to founders these days that maybe are product led and just self-service [inaudible 00:40:00] oriented. Do you kind of take this experience and wait as long as you can to hire your first salesperson? I know it's very specific to the situation, but what kind of advice do you generally give?

Carilu Dietrich (00:40:12):
You and I are both like [inaudible 00:40:14] who was just on your podcast earlier this month. Product led growth depends so much on your product and your buying market. There's some buying markets that are less likely to use salespeople, and you need to go in from the beginning. HR might be one, right? Whereas a lot of the hyper-growth companies in the dev tool space can use product led growth because developers both hate failed people, and really love to research themselves. So you see [inaudible 00:40:47] taking off because people engage and kind of self sell.

(00:40:52):
So I would recommend, get closer to their customers and read the signals. If your product is good enough, the people can get time to value in a couple of days instead of weeks or months. You can have a product led growth motion. If your product needs to be put in context, and customized, and assisted, sales teams sometimes are expensive services arms to cover over product issues and help customers buy it until it's fixed. Or if you're in a market where your buyer just really doesn't buy online with research and a demo, then you need to have salespeople. But I would say try not to hire too fast and too far ahead in sales and inside sales, because it seems like it's going to add revenue, but it actually is a huge cost and a huge drain on the business if the product isn't getting that kind of resonance.

Lenny (00:41:47):
I just had a conversation with the founder of Retool for this series that I'm working on, and he basically found the same thing you found where they thought it could be a product led experience where you're building internal tools using their product, but it turned out nobody really understood how to do it themselves and it took a lot of handholding to make it work. So they became sales led from the beginning, even though it feels like a tool that has a lot of potential to be product led and self-service.

Carilu Dietrich (00:42:11):
I think the other hybrid I'm starting to see is people who turn their SDR, sales development reps, into sales engineers, researchers. So instead of having a salesperson who's like, "Would you like to have a meeting with another salesperson?" The first touch for customers that are maybe kicking the tires or trying a product led growth is a person who can help guide them on the path. And I like this hybrid nature because basically it extends product led growth, but helps people in this case where you're talking, where the product itself isn't so intuitive that you can get all the way to the buy itself.

Lenny (00:42:51):
It also sounds more fun to talk to a sales engineer than a salesperson.

Carilu Dietrich (00:42:56):
I know. I always wanted to be a sales engineer. I was a salesperson, and I crushed on the sales. Engineering team who knew everything and could draw all the architectures.

Lenny (00:43:03):
Oh wow, I didn't know that. A couple more questions around this stuff. So you've worked with a lot of different companies. And you kind of come in and help them figure out ways to grow faster, unlock growth opportunities. What do you find often gets most in the way of making big changes to the way they approach growth and approach different growth channels? And maybe on the flip side, what do you find is most essential to making big changes at a company around how they think about growth?

Carilu Dietrich (00:43:30):
The big growth levers are pretty consistent across companies. You start with one product, and you have a couple choices on how the go-to-market works. Product leg growth or sales assisted. You get a little bit bigger and you add an incremental product, or you start to add new segments. You're going to focus on a vertical like finance, or you're going to go global, or you're going to add new sales channels like a partner channel. 

(00:43:56):
And what I've seen with the big growth levers is that it can't ever be an individual department's goal without being a cross company strategy goal, if it's really going to make a difference. 

(00:44:07):
So you've talked about it in your newsletter and on your podcast, but growth isn't just like a person in the engineering team that hacks by themselves. It really has to be funded and thoughtfully constructed so that there's the right content and experience, and product features, and virality features a customer to continue to drive growth.

(00:44:29):
And similarly, lots of companies right now are trying to move upmarket because the economy has created so much pressure in S&B that they're going to try to move to enterprise, or they've trying not to sell as much just to tech companies because tech companies are under pressure and so they want to move to different parts.

(00:44:51):
Sometimes the marketers get blamed or sales gets blamed, we don't have enough leads. But really it's a company strategy problem where the company hasn't decided, "Hey, we're going to all move in this direction and if we're going to sell the enterprise, marketing's going to bring in leads, products going to have a roadmap, and some meaningful features to enterprise. The customer research is going to start thinking about them. We're going to hire some customer support people who know how enterprises work. We're going to hire some salespeople who sell differently to enterprises than S&B." The big growth levers are strategy problems, not individual departmental problems.

Lenny (00:45:26):
And what do you find needs to happen for that to change? Is that like CEO needs to be like, "Here's what we're doing, everyone get on board," or something else?

Carilu Dietrich (00:45:35):
I think it can come either way in the C-suite, right? So my job, I advise hypergrowth CEOs and CMOs of companies, 30 million to 500 million. Often if I'm advising a 30 to 100 million company, the more junior marketer with a CEO who's often a first time founder, who doesn't necessarily know if the marketer's good or not. Hasn't done run marketing before, doesn't know if they should trust what the marketers saying.

(00:46:04):
So often the marketer is saying," Hey, we're having problems because the company's not delivering on this promise you want us to sell." And sometimes the CEO doesn't know if they can trust it, a judgment. And so in that case, someone like me who's an advisor comes in and is like, "That's right, it's not a marketing problem, it's company strategy problem. Let's have an offsite and build some OKRs where we all go after enterprise and we win it together."

(00:46:30):
You'll see at bigger companies or when a new CMO comes in with more senior or seasoned, they'll have the social capital to push back into the executive suite. Or a new head of engineering who will say, "Look, I know you want to move ahead faster, but we actually have to catch up on this technical debt." And they'll push back and get that strategic space that they need. So it can either come from the CEO or it can come from the C-suite really coming together to solve those problems, instead of pushing them under the rug.

Lenny (00:47:01):
You touched on this nuance that a lot of times, there's not a lot of trust between the marketing head and the CEO. And I'm curious what you find helps build that trust.

Carilu Dietrich (00:47:13):
There's a couple things that are really critical for senior marketers, and I actually have a blog coming up based on a podcast I've recorded about why CMOs mostly get fired. And the issues are generally one, that the CMO isn't focused enough on the revenue. So some CMOs get focused more on the pipeline or the awareness, and the CEO doesn't feel like they really have a partner in driving the revenue. Or they don't feel like the CMO really has a handle on what will drive the revenue.

(00:47:46):
So marketing's tough because it's a big spend category, and lots of the spend doesn't convert in quarter. Some of it doesn't convert in year. Advertising campaigns, some take multiple quarters.

(00:47:57):
So it's really important for CMOs to have a handle on the metrics, a solid prediction of what growth levers they can use, and to be able to talk in the terms of the CEO and the board.

(00:48:11):
And I think that that's the biggest gap that I generally see. And then of course, there's a whole bunch of table stake stuff. They have to be running their business well. They have to be a good leader that people want to work for. They have to hire a great team that elevates them and the company, they have to be thoughtful and strategic about the market space that the company's in. They're not just working the levers in the factory. They're thinking, "What new markets should we enter? What new growth areas should we employ?" Like we just talked about. "What new companies should we acquire?" They also need to be thinking ahead. And I think being good on metrics, good on strategy, and good on market helps CMOs spar with CEOs in a way that builds trust.

Lenny (00:49:00):
It's interesting that you say, that blog post you titled Why Most CMOs Get Fired, and it connects with something. Casey Winters noted, that most CPOs also get fired chief product officers. I forget the quote, but it's something like, "The most you can help for is a couple swings at the bat before you get fired as a CPO." Why do you think this is so common for these chief C-suite roles to startups to not work out?

Carilu Dietrich (00:49:26):
They're incredibly hard jobs. The chief product officer and the chief marketing officer are both strategy jobs with difficult to measure results because some of them are direct and some of them are indirect. And I think both of them get swept up when a company's not performing well too. If company's not performing well, you can kind of swap out the head of product, and the next one will be more strategic and deliver faster.

(00:49:55):
And in fact, I've worked in one of the roles, the CFO was really after my chief product officer, and ultimately got him fired because he wanted to move everything offshore, and develop faster, and he didn't want to re-platform, and he didn't want to deal with the technical debt. And the CFO was sure that it was the CPO's fault, and then they got rid of the CPO, and the CFO tried his plan and it didn't work. And then you bring someone in who's like, "No, that guy had the right plane."

(00:50:21):
So both of them are tough jobs. And they require a high bar of excellence, a high connection of trust, and then I think just endurance to keep going and find the next role where you're really a fit and the company really has momentum.

Lenny (00:50:36):
It also reminds me, I was just talking to, I think it was Canva. Where their first engineering hire is now their CTO still, and their first marketing hire is their CMO still. So it does work out on occasion.

Carilu Dietrich (00:50:48):
It works out on occasion. And in fact, I've been playing around with a 10 part series about those CMOs in the CMO world, because there's about 10 to 15 CMOs who have started when it's really small and grown all the way. And they're the ones we really want to learn from. And I know a lot of them and really admire their work, and have learned so much.

Lenny (00:51:09):
You should absolutely do that. That sounds very cool. You talked about how you work with companies from 30 million to 500 million. What is it about that stage that's unique, and what happens after 500 million, and what's the difference before say 30 million? I know it's not an exact number, but how do you think about that range?

Carilu Dietrich (00:51:24):
No, it's not an exact number. My bottom number is because there's this early stage of product market fit where the founder and the company are trying to figure out who their real ideal customer profile is, and can they sell to them consistently?

(00:51:39):
So I've worked for some early stage startups where we've tried lots of different things, but they're not repeatable. You can't scale it. "This product works for this. This product works for this too and it works for this," but those are all kind of unique cases studies. And so my skill is in helping people scale. 

(00:52:00):
And so if they've already found product market fit and they've gotten some funding or they're bootstrapped, but have enough funding to really be trying to build out marketing in a marketing team, that's when I know what each stage looks like. So I know what $30 million great teams look like, and 50 million, and 100, and 150 million, 200 million. My ride at Atlassian was from about 100 to 500.

(00:52:26):
And then over 500, the act of going public, being an early stage public company, I know what that all looks like. And then beyond that, there's public company consultants I think more, that do more specific things. I more help the CMO and CEO structure for the next stage of growth, because they're going through it so fast, they haven't hired someone yet who's already seen.

Lenny (00:52:51):
Got it. One very nuanced question I want to ask you is about bundling. So there's HipChat and Slack kind of ate their lunch, not necessarily through bundling, but there's Slack. And then Slack, I don't know if it's true, but it feels like Microsoft Teams is eating their lunch with bundling. And I'm curious, what do you think of bundling as a strategy to win long-term? And also, how do you compete against say, a Microsoft that may one day bundle your product for free, and you might be in big trouble?

Carilu Dietrich (00:53:22):
I think it's two separate questions, so let me take them separately. The first is, what do I think about bundling? So small and medium-sized companies will go from being a single product company to a multi-product company in order to progress. Because you need a diversified financial model, because you need to be able to sell new products into your customer base who should already be friendly to you if they like your products. And because you need to really expand your total addressable market to get to be $1 billion or $2 billion company. But I believe in bundling is a growth strategy.

(00:53:57):
Specifically for product led growth companies, bundling is not a great land strategy. So at Atlassian, we had a number of products and experimented with different bundled lands. And it really slowed down the product led growth motion. So we ended up going back to land with a single product, high velocity, single person uses it quickly starts to get value, and then come in with other things.

(00:54:22):
So from that perspective, product led growth bundling is not very effective. Bundling for a sales led motion is pretty effective when you're at the right stage of growth. 

(00:54:33):
And then as far as the question of competing against Microsoft, there's these two parts of the philosophies. A best of breed and an all in one. An Oracle was an all in one, and Microsoft is an all in one. You can buy all the things and your CFO can get a discount by spending a whole bunch of money on a bunch of things. But in the all-in one, some of the pieces aren't as good as the best of breed.

(00:54:57):
And so Slack for a long time was the best of breed. People were willing to pay more because they thought it was markedly better than the other instant messaging options. 

(00:55:07):
But there's shifts between best of breed and all in one in economic wins. So right now, CFOs are putting the squeeze. Is Slack really that much better than Microsoft if the Microsoft one is free with all of our other purchases? It's tough. It's tough to go head-to-head with a powerful, big investing, all-in-one competitor. The only way to win is to be the best and have a product that's so much better, that it's worth the extra money.

Lenny (00:55:37):
Interesting. So essentially in a tough environment, bundling is most effective almost. And then this other interesting point about [inaudible 00:55:47], you want to stay focused on one specific pain point. What is it that Atlassian tried to do that they tried to pitch all your planning products in one suite? Is that kind of what we-

Carilu Dietrich (00:55:59):
Well, Jira was the issue tracking. And then we also had Confluence, which was the Wiki page. So let's say there was a business bundle that could have been HipChat, Confluence and Jira. Or there were developer combinations that could have been Jira, Bitbucket, and maybe Confluence too for an engineering team.

(00:56:19):
Basically, if you have to evaluate multiple products to purchase something, it's not a fast and easy online self-service buy. Because you're like, "Do I need all three products? Can I break them apart? Do they all work? Are each of them best of breed?" Whereas if you're like, "I need issue tracking, I'm going to buy Jira, this looks good. I've tried it out, I'm ready to go." That can happen in seven days. Whereas if you add in multiple products, it takes more days and just leads to fewer conversions.

Lenny (00:56:52):
That makes absolute sense. I can see someone thinking the complete opposite and then now realizing how we see. I see why this isn't working.

Carilu Dietrich (00:56:58):
You should always test it. Right? I mean, the secret to product led growth is can you test it? And so we tested everything. We tried bundles. We didn't try bundles. We tried different things in the bundles. We tried different days. Data led insights are better than anything any pundits would say on a podcast.

Lenny (00:57:17):
Amazing. Well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? 

Carilu Dietrich (00:57:22):
I'm ready.

Lenny (00:57:23):
Okay. What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Carilu Dietrich (00:57:28):
The number one book is a life book called Tao Te Ching, the Stephen Mitchell translation. And the Tao Te Ching is a philosophy about the flow of life. And I love it. I've carried the Pocket Guide with me for 25 years. 

(00:57:40):
The second one is business focused. Never Split the Difference, which is a great book about negotiating written by a former CIA hostage negotiator, which also helps me with negotiations at work and with my children. So that's a great book.

Lenny (00:57:58):
Actually, I've been trying to read that book on audio. What's something you've taken away from me? Because the stories are so interesting and I'm always like, "What should I actually do in my day-to-day life?" What stuck with you?

Carilu Dietrich (00:58:08):
It's kind of the obvious thing that I wasn't good at. It's that you just really want to put yourself so deeply in the shoes of the other person, that you can figure out what make the win for both of you, right? Basically he says, "You can't win the negotiation by strong arming what you want. You really get to get to a win-win," which is probably every negotiation book ever. But he texturizes it so much. So I just felt like I was really able to... In my last office, we moved last year. I actually had the CliffNotes of his book printed out and posted on my wall because he had a series of questions to help you get deeper and deeper into the mindset behind people. 

(00:58:49):
And connected, but not connected the book How To Win Friends and Influence People, that's the 1932 bestseller, is basically that. People don't want to hear about you. They want you to be thinking about them. And then you can make friends with them, or you can negotiate with them, or you can get your hostage back.

Lenny (00:59:08):
I read How to Win Friends and Influence People when I was very young. And specifically, the chapters about there's no better sound in the world to someone than their name. Carilu.

Carilu Dietrich (00:59:19):
It's true. Thank you. You said it correctly.

Lenny (00:59:22):
Okay, moving on. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Carilu Dietrich (00:59:26):
My favorite movie is Everything Everywhere All at Once. It's basically a sci-fi about all the different ways your life could turn out if you made different choices. And it was really a mind bender that made me think about all the different ways tiny decisions have changed my life, but then also an appreciation for the life that you have. At the end, it doesn't ruin the story, but she has this love of what she has, even though it's not as good or as different as some of the other options.

Lenny (00:59:26):
I love it.

Carilu Dietrich (00:59:58):
So I bought this poster. I don't think you can see it on the bath, but it says, "Gratitude turns what we have into enough."

Lenny (01:00:07):
Very Buddhist. 

Carilu Dietrich (01:00:08):
I like it. Read the Tao Te Ching.

Lenny (01:00:10):
Not a Post-it, but art. Another teaching from Carilu. I think this needs to be a second newsletter of yours. Life advice.

Carilu Dietrich (01:00:20):
Which is funny. I've been thinking about that one. It would be called The Tao of Hypergrowth.

Lenny (01:00:25):
Oh my God. I love that.

Carilu Dietrich (01:00:26):
And actually, I was thinking about doing it and taking actual clips from the Tao Te Ching, and doing textural analysis about how it applies to our. I've been thinking about this actual podcast for a while because I used to want to do the... I mean blog, the Tao of Parenthood. Because basically parenting, you try to control and fix all the things you didn't do right in your life. But actually, it's the act of providing freedom that lets them go out and explore and then come back to your way of being. So, I don't know. The Tao Te Ching, I love it.

Lenny (01:00:58):
I see so many opportunities. You got to stop what you're doing. Just write all these things.

Carilu Dietrich (01:01:02):
I know. But I love the hypergrowth customers, clients.

Lenny (01:01:06):
All right. Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Carilu Dietrich (01:01:11):
So this is a little heavy, but it actually is my favorite. It's, "How many people have you fired? And tell me about each of the experiences." So the reason I ask this question is because generally, I'm managing teams of managers. And generally, I need people who have managed many people for a longer period of time. Or even if they're junior managers, how long and how many people they've managed is indicated by how many people they've fired. Because if you've never fired anyone, then you haven't managed very many people for very long, unfortunately.

(01:01:39):
And firing people is the hardest part of a leader's career. So how they talk about it, their compassion, and their need to drive the business, and the circumstances, "Was it layoffs? How did that work? Did you have to performance manage someone out? How did it work? Did you just have to restructure the team because of business goals? How did it work?" Gives you a lot of insight into their experience and their humanity in a way that they're not prepared for. So you really get the real story, and get a sense for what they would be like as a leader under a lot of pressure and difficult situations.

Lenny (01:02:17):
I've never heard that one before and I love it. Reminds me of a episode with Matt Mochary where we talk about how to lay people off really successfully and elegantly.

Carilu Dietrich (01:02:26):
It's a hard.

Lenny (01:02:27):
Yeah. Next question. What's a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?

Carilu Dietrich (01:02:34):
So I follow my favorite products to the companies that I advise. I love 1Password. I've got my 85-year-old grandfather and all of my family and friends set up on it. I love the cross-platform nature.

(01:02:45):
I love Miro and whiteboards. I joined Productboard because of this cross-company alignment and views into what's coming up on the roadmap, which is really the most important thing for the company. Momentum, as we talked about, having a great product and a great product strategy. 

(01:03:02):
And then I'm dabbling in all the AI things. I want to be excellent in AI visualization and art. I'm experimenting with Midjourney, but still kind of flailing. I've hired my 13-year old as my strategic advisor. And yeah, I'd love to work for OpenAI and ChatGPT. It's really interesting.

Lenny (01:03:23):
What's something relatively minor that you've changed in the way a product is built or just the company operates, that has led to tremendous impact on their ability to execute?

Carilu Dietrich (01:03:33):
On the product side, one of the concepts that I really like is the Amazon concept around writing the press release at the beginning of a product ideation. So one of the issues between marketing and product is the product will work so hard on something, and there'll be lots of different features, that it won't really be a theme that the marketing team can talk about. And then someone hands it to marketing and says, "Make this marketable." One of my mentors had this comment, "It's a bag of doorknobs." What do I do with this bag of doorknobs? Who wants to buy a bag of doorknobs? They want to buy the door and the concept.

(01:04:13):
So I like this idea of writing a press release. Start with the end in mind, and then negotiate. Is this good enough? Will this really resonate? Or is this really what we're trying to build? Or is this really the outcome we're trying to get with the product? So I've heard about Amazon do it. We experimented with it at Classy. I haven't done it at mass scale, but I love the concept.

Lenny (01:04:31):
Final question. I know you're a meditator. We've talked a little bit about your Buddhist nature. What's one tip for people that have been trying to meditate and just can't make it happen? What's your one tip for helping people meditate more often?

Carilu Dietrich (01:04:44):
So I'm a cheater because I was groomed to meditate. I don't remember how early, but I remember that the first meditations my mom had me listen to was a rainbow butterfly as I fell asleep when I was in kindergarten.

(01:04:55):
So I've been meditating my whole life, with mixed success. And the real secret is just that there's no right way, that there's no wrong way. That it's just making the time to be present, and breathe, and sense, and be here now. 

(01:05:13):
And so I use guided meditations mostly, because I'm not the best at quieting my own mind. I'm thrifty. So I use some free meditations. I use Tara Brach, who's a great meditator, who has short and long concept meditations. 

(01:05:30):
And I like this old one called Meditation Oasis, which actually isn't in publishing anymore, but it's still a podcast. And I re-listen to all theirs over and over. So stick with it is the secret to meditation, and any benefits you get from being present in meditation, hopefully carry over to be being present in life.

Lenny (01:05:51):
My whole body just relaxed as you were talking through all that. So you have a skill. Carilu, this was amazing. We learned how to grow products, how to live better lives, how to become more mindful. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out? And/or how can listeners be useful to you?

Carilu Dietrich (01:06:09):
Follow me on LinkedIn, or I have a new blog carilu.com on Substack. Thanks to Lenny for the inspiration. And I still have one more advisory slot open, and I'd love to work with more AI companies. I just joined Weights & Biases in the ML op space. But if you know of other great scale up AI companies, I'd love to help junior marketing executives or first time founders see what the next stage of growth looks like and get there.

Lenny (01:06:39):
Amazing. And again, if they are interested in that, how do they reach out to you?

Carilu Dietrich (01:06:43):
On LinkedIn or through carilu.com.

Lenny (01:06:47):
Amazing. Carilu, thank you again so much for making time and for being here. 

Carilu Dietrich (01:06:50):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (01:06:51):

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00):
The goal of your Kindle strategies, these like non-scalable hacks, they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users.

Lenny (00:12):
Pinterest, Airbnb, Reddit, Canva, Hipcamp, Thumbtack, Fair, Tinder, Eventbrite. What do these companies have in common? Casey Winters, Casey has worked with and advised more consumer companies on their product and growth strategy than anyone in the world. He's also very generous with his time and often sets time aside to help founders and product leaders. I always learned so much talking to Casey, and I'm excited for you to hear this episode. In our chat we covered Casey's advice on making trade offs as a product leader, justifying non-sexy product investments, the spectrum of product people and how to level up your skills, new growth trends and tactics that he's seeing, when to focus on growth, and a bunch of advice on growth strategy, and so many other things. As a bonus, we're going to be doing a live AMA with Casey in my newsletter Slack community on August 5th at 10:00 AM Pacific time, so if you'd like to ask Casey any questions, make sure to get there. Until then enjoy this episode with Casey Winters. Hey Casey Winters, what do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (01:19):
Coda's a company that's actually near and dear to my heart because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create LKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it, so they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (01:56):
I actually use Coda myself every day, it's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, to organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners of this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement, just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

(02:22):

(03:26):
Casey, welcome to the pod. I feel like every time that we chat, I leave with at least one new perspective that kind of blew my mind on product, or growth, or even just the world. And so I'm really excited to have this conversation mostly to selfishly extract as much knowledge out of your head as I can in the hour that we have together. And so with that welcome.

Casey Winters (03:50):
Very kind, happy to be here.

Lenny (03:52):
You've worked at so many iconic companies and worked with so many iconic companies. It almost boggles the mind just looking at your LinkedIn, trying to scroll through LinkedIn and you have to click on, see additional experiences. And there's just so many places you've worked, so many companies you've worked with. Could you just give listeners maybe a 10,000 foot view of your career arc through product and growth?

Casey Winters (04:15):
Well, I started my career as an analyst at apartments.com on the marketing side, so it was my job to measure every channel for effectiveness in driving leads. These are things like SEO, AdWords, affiliate marketing email, so once I got good at measuring that I naturally started working on optimizing those channels directly. And then I started going to do user research and understand how the product could be better so that we could convert leads better. And it was at that point that I got the feedback from the company that I was this weird marketing and product hybrid, and they didn't really know what to do with that, because those were two totally separate departments. It wasn't until I got to GrubHub and I was the 15th employee and they were like, dude, we don't care.

(05:01):
As long as you grow how many people order food, I don't care if you work on marketing, I don't care if you change the product, do whatever we'll have results. And we now call these roles growth, but that term didn't exist at the time, so I basically worked on growing the demand side of that business from Series A to IPO. We ended up creating a product management function out of my team there, but for the first four years we didn't have product titles either. That was kind of a newer idea, also. It wasn't until I went to Pinterest that I was actually formally labeled a product person.

(05:37):
I ended up leading the growth product team there. We basically had to rebuild the growth model of the business to reignite growth, so I was there from 40 million MAU to 150 million MAU. And it was around that time that I started doing some more advising with Airbnb on the demand side, with Pocket. And then I went to a VC named Greylock Partners and worked with their companies on growth and scaling. And then I just independently started working as a full-time advisor with companies like Eventbrite, Tinder, Thumbtack, Canva. And after doing that for a couple years, Eventbrite opened this chief product officer role and they asked me to take it, so now I've been doing that for three years now.

Lenny (06:18):
That's an excellent segue to our next little segment that I want to get into, which is partly your CPO role and the work that you do there. And also touching a bit on a bit of the writing that you've done. You're currently a chief product officer at Eventbrite, which is a company that I love, I have so many friends there and they're all amazing, such a big fan of the company. And I know a lot of listeners are maybe thinking about becoming CPO someday as a goal.

Casey Winters (06:18):
Yep.

Lenny (06:43):
And so I thought it'd be cool to chat through some of the challenges that you're having and some of the things you've learned in the role.

Casey Winters (06:49):
Sure.

Lenny (06:50):
Cool.

Casey Winters (06:50):
Yeah.

Lenny (06:51):
I'll be more specific, so one of the things that you mentioned that you're working on is thinking about trade offs and being very explicit about trade offs you're making, communicating why you made certain trade offs and then just generally communicating that upward to executives and then across the company, so I'm curious just to hear what you've learned around how to communicate trade offs and internal communication?

Casey Winters (07:11):
Yeah, one of the things I found, especially during the pandemic at Eventbrite, where we weren't obviously hiring a lot of people and we had lots of various issues come up, is that a lot of managers and leaders would just try to deal with issues on their own and not raise them or escalate them with me in particular. And some of these were really tough situations, so then later on, I'd ask why something went wrong or why we didn't achieve a goal. And I get some feedback from my team of like, Hey, you don't understand the situation. This is really impossible. There's all these things going wrong. And then I respond. Yeah, of course I don't understand this situation because you haven't told me about it. How am I supposed to evaluate things fairly if you don't let me know what's really going on, so these people on my team thought that being a leader was handling it the best they could given the circumstances when in many cases the right way is to escalate the issue so that perhaps I could help them change the circumstances, so the circumstances aren't as dire.

(08:14):
And if I can't change the circumstances, I'm at least aware of the circumstances and the explicit trade off we've made to deal with that situation. And then I can help communicate that better to others across the company, and I can help evaluate the results with the proper context and do it more fairly. I find that in general people just way under communicate upward inside of companies. And then they'll complain that executives are out of touch when they aren't telling executives what the executives need to know. Then when people inside a company do try to communicate upward a lot of times they're so in the weeds that as an executive, I just don't understand what they're saying. And then when I ask questions it's like as an exec, I'm asking a question in another language. It's like I don't know if you've ever seen Ocean's Twelve, but as a joke, they invite Matt Damon to this business meeting and they just talk in code as a prank on him.

(09:14):
And that's what a lot of people on my team feel sometimes when they're talking to the executives of like, I don't even understand what these questions mean. It's like you're speaking another language. One of the ways I try to frame it to my team is if you're not an executive, whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one, which is what part of the company strategy are you working on? What metrics are you trying to improve? What assumptions are you making that are guiding what you're building? And I find that many times when non-executives are presenting to execs, they'll start on like chapter six, so even if that part of the story is right, it's like a good story. You haven't earned the right to tell that part of the story yet because you skipped the first five chapters. And I've definitely seen people with the opposite problem as well, which I call starting at the beginning of the time where you come into a meeting with the CEO or with the CFO or something.

(10:20):
And you basically spend the first 20 minutes, re-explaining the company strategy or who our customer is or something that everyone already knows. And then by the time you get to explaining new information, you've used up your allotted time, so I try to coach my team to be in the middle. Like don't start on chapter six of the story, but also don't start with a textbook on the English language either. You want to find the last point in your story, that would be completely obvious to the person you're telling the story to, and then go from there to things that would be less obvious, but that they can follow along with. And it's a lot of work to really dial that in across different types of people you're trying to communicate that story to because of course, upward communication isn't all that you're doing, right? You're trying to communicate that down to your team, to individual engineers and designers, and they're going to need to hear some very different things then say the CPO of the company, or the CEO of the company, so it's a challenge I see quite frequently.

Lenny (11:19):
Can you talk a bit about how you actually coach PMs on this? Is this like in one-on-ones you revisit a presentation they gave that could have been better? Is it after a presentation, you pull them aside and talk through what they could have done better. How do you approach that?

Casey Winters (11:33):
Well, I think the best way to coach is actually to do it before the meeting, so I think there's a tendency in product management and product design to want to do meetings where there's kind of this big reveal and an aha to the audience. And it's kind of the opposite of how you want to handle most of these situations. You want to de-risk that meeting not make it a big success or fail moment, so there's a few things that I do. One is if there is a big presentation coming up or something like that, I try to run through it with the team, pretending to be the other members of the audience that are going to be there, so I'll say, okay, well, what the CFO's going to ask about here is X. And you want to answer that question before it gets asked. What Julia, our CEO is going to ask about is why, so you want to weave that into the early story and not wait for her to ask.

(12:28):
You kind of role play the entire thing based on the different people that they're going to be communicating with. Something I commonly say is that executive communication is actually executives communication. You're communicating with individual executives that all have different styles and different concerns about the business or about the particular problem you're working on. And you want to anticipate that, and if you don't have enough experience say presenting to the CFO or the CEO, I as the chief product officer do, so I can impersonate them and help you understand what they're going to care most about. The other thing that I push a lot of my team to do is have pre-meetings with some of those key individuals, so that they're going to be less surprised in the meeting about what you're talking about, that you've gotten any major concerns brought to your attention before the big meeting.

(13:18):
And that helps de-risk how poorly a meeting like that can go, so definitely at the individual presentation level, doing that pre-meeting. What I'm working on a lot now is trying to have more of a scaled approach to training this type of upward communication. And what types of frameworks, what types of structure tend to work for Eventbrite and making sure that everyone on my team is just really well versed in that and comfortable in it because of course, confidence projection is a key part of these types of meetings as well.

Lenny (13:54):
This is such important advice that I think a lot of PMs don't recognize how important it is to prepare for important meetings like this. Just to give folks context, maybe that aren't doing this sort of thing when they're working at a larger company, how much time do you spend or an ICPM should spend on preparing for these things just to set a little bit of a reference point?

Casey Winters (14:13):
Well, it's an interesting question because I think different people have different styles on how they want to handle this. I'd say the way my brain works in these situations which I think is a little bit atypical, is I'm actually a little bit better if I am free forming a lot of elements and just speaking from confidence in areas I know versus specifically trying to lay out every exact bullet point I want to hit. I'm going to show up as more comfortable, I'm going to show up as more dynamic, and I'm going to be able to engage in a more thoughtful conversation, so for me, my approach to these sorts of things is I write a lot. I write a lot of notes. I write a lot of documents. And then in general, for any of these types of communications, I am just pulling from things I know deeply because I've written them down, I've thought a lot about them.

(15:10):
For a lot of other people they really just need to spend a lot of time on prep to make sure they nail the communication they want to nail. And I found it requires a different amount of investment for different people on my team, so the point is not as much how much time you spend, it's how well do you really know the material, and how well do you really know what your audience is going to care about with that material so that you are prepared for every question you might get. I'll give an example from my Pinterest days, the primary way with which you interfaced on any key strategic topic was product review, right? You'd go in and you talk to Ben, our CEO and Jack our head of product. And Ben and Jack had very different styles of communication. Jack in particular would very early on ask a few different data questions to get context on the problem. And if you, as a product leader or an individual PM or an individual designer didn't know the answers to any of those, it cast doubt on the entire rest of that meeting.

(16:17):
Because, the team wouldn't be confident that you had all the right context to understand the problem, so a lot of what I would coach my team on is, okay, I'm pretty confident Jack's going to ask this question, then this question, then this question. Based on the material I'm seeing from you, how well are you prepared to answer those questions? Different execs might be somewhat different in that regard, but if you haven't thought through all the questions that might be asked from the document that you're sharing or the presentation you're about to present, you're not prepared enough, right. You need to know the entire universe of how that meeting can go. And that may take you dozens of hours, it might take you three hours, but the most important thing is that you've asked what possible questions can be asked and am I prepared to answer all of those? Do I have all the data in front of me to answer all of those? But because if I don't the chances of the meeting you're having a negative outcome just increased dramatically.

Lenny (17:17):
I imagine some people are listening to this and they're like, holy shit, I need to spend this much time on preparing for meetings like this, but in my experience, that's exactly what you do need to do to be successful. And so this is real good, real talk about how long it takes to prepare for important meetings like the ones you're talking about.

Casey Winters (17:33):
Absolutely. I mean, for better or worse, the way that a lot of key decisions are made inside companies are through these types of forums and meetings. And it's an extremely high leverage piece of time for a product manager or a product designer in terms of how much impact they can have. And if you are under preparing for those sorts of things, the chances of you being able to have the type of impact you want, to have the type of career growth you want just go down dramatically. And I'm sure, you and I have definitely made mistakes in our career in important meetings in the past, but I think one of the things that I really try to do is learn from each one of those and make sure those types of issues wouldn't happen again. And now I feel like I have a pulse on, I know if I haven't done the work going into a meeting, that's going to make it have a more negative result.

(18:26):
And now I'm pretty accurate. And look sometimes you just didn't have enough time and it is what it is. But now I know, okay, I know I'm not quite prepared for this and it can go poorly as a result. And I know also when I've done the right prep and I'm ready for anything, whether it's a board meeting, or a meeting with the executive team, or a meeting with an external partner, right? And I think that's what you're trying to build as any sort of product leader, or PM, or product designer, or researcher, is that intuition of like I'm ready for this, I know everything that's going to come at me, I'm prepared for any eventual outcome. And if you're not, then probably the answer is spend more time to get ready.

Lenny (19:09):
Speaking of spending more time, another topic that you shared with me that you're thinking a lot about as a CPO is keeping the Eventbrite product simple while adding more and more functionality to make it more usable by more people and more use cases. And so I'd love to hear how you're approaching that because I know that's something every single product faces eventually assuming they keep growing, and survive, and keep adding more power.

Casey Winters (19:34):
Yeah, Scott Belsky who's the chief product officer of Adobe. He has this concept of the product life cycle you're probably familiar with, but I'll explain it to your listeners, which is users flock to a simple product. The product takes users for granted and adds more features for power users and then users flock to the next simple product as a result. And I've done a lot of research and work on this problem. And I found that there are a few different design hacks, essentially that companies use to try to avoid this cycle. One is okay if you build out more complex functionality, un-bundle it over time, like Facebook Messenger, Uber Eats have done, right? At Pinterest, we did a heavy investment in progressive disclosure, which is let's hide a lot of the more complex functionality until we make sure our users learn the really critical functionality. And then we can open up more of the full suite of the product.

(20:34):
Then there's just proactive training. You can get on a video call with your customers or a phone call, much more common in enterprise, obviously, or you might have a custom UI that goes away over time. That's giving you the training wheels. You can also segment experiences based on different user types, so certain users might get a very simple user experience and then some users might get the more complex one, and there's different packages and interfaces that cleanly separate the two, maybe that more complex experience also bundles in training. What I found is that just none of these really worked that well for the Eventbrite scenario, because we have different types of event creators across every possible level of complexity and sophistication. We have people that are putting on their first event and they expect five people to show up. We have people putting on a hundred events per year that really know what they're doing.

(21:32):
And then users also shift from one of those categories to another over time. They can get more sophisticated as they build up their business, so segmentation doesn't really work that well. Progressive disclosure doesn't work that well either because in many of these cases, we never want certain types of users to find the more advanced stuff, it's just going to confuse them. We strive for this concept of what we call perceived simplicity, which is there are advanced features in the product and they are easily discoverable when you look for them, but they're effectively hidden if you're not looking for them. And of course the majority of users aren't going to ever look for them, so the advanced more complex areas of the product don't make the product harder to use for the majority who will never need that level of complexity. And there are areas where we do this well and areas where we're still working on getting better, but that's really our aspiration.

(22:26):
The company that I feel like has always done the best job of this is WhatsApp, where at its core, it's a chat app and it's really good at being a chat app. But I remember when I went to Brazil, all of a sudden I started receiving voice messages and it was really easy to figure out how to use them and how to do them myself. When I needed to learn how to do video calls or phone calls, it would take less than a second to figure out how to use the more advanced stuff, but it's effectively kind of hidden if you're not looking for it. That's what we aspire to at Eventbrite. And in some cases we're doing well. And in some cases, we definitely have some work to do.

Lenny (22:59):
Is there an example of a win in that direction in the Eventbrite product that you're proud of using this model or even something that's like, oh man, this is really broken?

Casey Winters (23:08):
Yeah, we've definitely had some wins here on the marketing side of our products, so one of the bigger investments we've made recently is our creators do a lot of their own marketing to try to get people to come to their events and transact on Eventbrite in the process. But our event creators, they're not professional marketers, they try to figure these tools out, so we built a product that allows them to automate their Facebook advertising to get better results, supercharged by our data. And the product's working really well, but we found is that there are certain segments that, I want to geek out on this a little bit, right.

(23:47):
They want to figure out all the different target segments and optimize their creative, and then there are many creators who just want it done for them. We've been able to build some interfaces where the default is super simple, we'll handle the targeting for you, we'll handle the creative and then, Hey, here's an on-ramp if you want to get a little bit more sophisticated and do more of this yourself, so that's an area where I wouldn't say we've perfected it, but we've now really understood those different types of users and a have easy pass for both of them to be successful, so I'm really happy with that.

Lenny (24:22):
Awesome. Another topic that you wrote about that kind of touches on the stuff we were just talking about is justify non-sexy product improvements, things like stability, performance, developer velocity, things that as a PM leader, you're just like, no, no, no, let's just... The default is let's do that later, we got to hit our fricking metrics, we've got to drive growth. And you had some really interesting insights on how you think about justifying these sorts of things. And so I'd love to hear that from you?

Casey Winters (24:49):
The idea is that some of the most impactful projects that product teams can work on at scale, not early stage startups per se, but at scale are the hardest to measure. And because of that, they just get chronically underfunded. It's that old adage, what gets measured gets managed, right? For things like user experience, or performance, or developer velocity, or just a product area that's deemed un-sexy, like growth used to be back in the day, I walk through some examples of a few tactics that work to get around this problem, building custom metrics to show the value, being able to run small tests that prove the worthwhile-ness of the investment, creating some team principles that make sure you don't ever kind of forget about these important elements that can hurt you in the long run. And also just how to use experiments to build buy-in at the broader level.

(25:41):
And one of the main takeaways besides some of those tactics in being successful here is that you have to get a team to buy-in to this. You can't really do a lot of this work alone, right? If you're a PM, you want to be approaching this from a well, my engineering manager and my design leader also bought in that we need to work on performance or we've all aligned that the user experience is not going in quite the direction we want, and we want to head some problems off that may not improve metrics today, but could certainly decline metrics tomorrow. And if you can get a small team, what two, three people aligned on the importance of something that's deemed un-sexy. It's a lot easier to start to build this game plan around metrics or running small tests or structuring OKRs to not only prioritize this work, but to show some really massive impact. Which could then get the rest of the company much more excited to make investments themselves.

Lenny (26:48):
What I'm hearing is step one is just get your kind of peer leaders aligned behind something that may not obviously be something your leaders want you to do, is that right?

Casey Winters (26:59):
Absolutely, yep.

Lenny (27:01):
This episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I asked product managers and designers on Twitter, what software do they use most? Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, white boarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs. And that includes thousands of built in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer, visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up, that's whimsical.com/lenny.

(27:47):
Is there anything else that you think is really valuable, powerful, effective in just getting folks to getting your leaders to basically go along with some that maybe isn't going to move metrics or is that the core of it?

Casey Winters (27:57):
Well, yeah. I mean, definitely it's hard when you can't create a metric that they can understand. I think the other area to think about is when you're an early stage company, everything you're doing is trying to drive upside, like trying to drive growth in some way, it could be short term or long term, but you're trying to drive real growth for the business. But then when you've actually built a real business, a lot of times people are still in that same mode, which is everything is trying to add more growth on top of what we've already got. But when you're at scale, you can actually lose what you've built, so trying to help whether it's executives or just your manager, understand that this thing we've got, whether it's a high conversion rate or good engagement on this feature, it could go away if we don't do these other things.

(28:48):
And here's what it would look like if that goes away, that can be incredibly powerful. I think we were fortunate at Pinterest in this regard, in that we were a fast growing startup that stopped growing due to some changes in the market related to Facebook. And then actually once we had switched to growing primarily through SEO, there was an algorithm change that severely impacted our growth at one point in time, so that helped the company build more intuition of like we're not guaranteed the gains from all the things we've built in the past. We need to do things to protect them and protecting what we've got actually is increasingly important once you build scale, because now you've built something really valuable already. And yes, we want to make it more valuable of course, but it's hard to make it more valuable if you're eroding some of the gains you've already built, so that's another element that I think can be pretty impactful.

Lenny (29:41):
In your post on this topic you have an awesome chart of product market fit over time, illustrating the point you just made that it doesn't last and you have to keep iterating to keep your product market fit like you're by default falling behind if you're not continuing to push there, right?

Casey Winters (29:54):
Yeah. I think the concept is user expectations just continue to go up every day in terms of their expectations on user experience, on the value that they expect your product to provide, but also the competitive landscape in the market continues to get better. Yeah, if you're not continually pushing to make your product better, your user experience better, your latency better, then you're eventually not necessarily tomorrow, but maybe in a year, maybe in five years, you might find yourself fall out of product market fit entirely. And that's a really dangerous place to be, because then it's going to take a long time to figure that out and make adjustments. And then you probably have more technical debt to clean up, to be able to get back to where you need to be, where the market has reached in terms of expectations, so just doing work to make sure you never get in that situation is extremely valuable, in my opinion. It's something that I think a lot of teams forget about.

Lenny (30:54):
I think you're going to create nightmares for a lot of founders listening to this right now.

Casey Winters (30:59):
That's not the intention, but-

Lenny (31:02):
No, it's a kick in the butt. Another post that I definitely wanted to chat about. Maybe your SPST post, maybe I'm curious if there are others is around operations team, product ops and generally ops people.

Casey Winters (31:12):
Yep.

Lenny (31:13):
And this point that you made that ops is often a sign of inefficiency on a product team because in theory, a lot of the roles should be done by software, eventually. I'd love to unpack this and hear your take on this?

Casey Winters (31:26):
I think I originally got the idea for the post in that I had written another essay on MarTech. And how MarTech to be really successful, it's really got a target engineers more so than marketers. And that a lot of MarTech businesses just aren't very good businesses. And I think I got an invite to speak at a MarTech conference to a bunch of marketers about this post. And it's like, well, that sounds like a terrible idea. I'm basically telling a bunch of marketers that what they're investing in isn't that important, and that they're not the most important target customer. And I remember reading something about the conference that was like a conference for the growth of the marketing operations professional. And then I was like, oh no, that's not what I want in the industry at all. Like having marketing ops means you suck at marketing.

(32:18):
And obviously that's a bit of hyperbole. I'm not against the concept of a marketing ops role or a product ops role, we have a product ops team at Eventbrite, but as someone who ran a double digit million marketing budget at GrubHub without marketing ops, because we invested in automation and we invested in process, it scares me when the first tactic people go to is to add people to help scale. There's nothing wrong with people obviously, there's nothing wrong with operations people. The thing I have a problem with is normalizing ops as a distinct stable function where operations rules are amazing and how we utilize them at Eventbrite is their explicit job is to go find inefficiencies and build process or software to root out that inefficiency, so then they can go find other places to be more valuable. When you say, oh, their job is to do this manual process long term.

(33:16):
That's where I get super concerned because you're not rooting out efficiency in how you build your company. And that's where I feel like a lot of this can go if you're not careful, Intercom has a really good blog post on this from a while back around their business operations team. And they basically up front in that post say the goal of business operations is to not exist, and I definitely very much agree with that. I think in general functional ops roles, whether it's product ops or marketing ops or whatever, they're a hack to deal with some sort of functional issue on your team. And it's totally okay to have functional issues. Startups are going to have functional issues all over the place, but if the way they deal with that functional issue is by building larger and larger operations teams and roles. That's basically exacerbating an inefficiency issue, a functional issue, it's not fixing it. It's a form of empire building and in general empire building is something I don't have a lot of tolerance for.

(34:16):
You're making more of a function unable to operate without human intervention by saying the goal is to scale up marketing ops or product ops. Whereas what the goal should be is let's use our brains to run experiments, to make us more functional with less people. We're more efficient, we could add more value to the customer, and to the business. And if that means I don't actually need to have this product operations job in a year. That's awesome. And guess what, if you've shown you've done a really great job at rooting out inefficiencies. Every part of the company's going to want you to do some other job if that job is no longer valuable, because you've done such good job eliminating the need for it. There isn't this real concern that I'm going to lose my job by being too effective at it. It's like, no, you're going to show that you're just awesome at many types of jobs that product leaders or marketing leaders care about, so that's my perspective.

Lenny (35:09):
I love that. And this happened a lot at Airbnb, a lot of amazing office people ended up moving into other roles once the role was not necessary or they just wanted to do something else. And clearly people wanted them on their team because they were killing it.

Casey Winters (35:20):
Indeed.

Lenny (35:21):
One last question about the CPO role, and then I want to shift a bit to just product management and growth. What is the job of a CPO for folks that are just like, what the heck, what is this thing? What do you do all day?

Casey Winters (35:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (35:32):
And then what does it take to get there? Just like what should people work on most if they're trying to get to CPO someday?

Casey Winters (35:39):
First off, when you think about what's the job, the way I think about it is I'm responsible for leading and facilitating the development of products and features that deliver value for Eventbrite's customers that will translate into value for the business. And each of those words were chosen pretty carefully. Now in terms of the scope of the function, a CPO role can lead a few different sub-functions. In my case, I lead product management, product design, research, and growth marketing, but different roles have kind of some or not as many of those, it can be pretty custom depending on the size of the company and what the leader's skill sets are. To talk a little bit more depth about the role. I think it's my job to make sure Eventbrite chooses the best possible product strategy based on the information we have, that we can adjust that strategy as we learn and continue to build that feedback loop.

(36:35):
It's also my job to define and consistently improve the process through which we set our product strategy, how we prioritize projects, how we execute on them to make sure we're delivering that value to our customers, we're delivering those tangible business results. And to do that in a way where the rest of the company understands it and is able to participate in it as well, so this is things like identifying bottlenecks that prevent us from delivering value, or quality, or doing that at the detriment of speed, working with people across the company to remove those bottlenecks, making sure people outside of development are aware of what we're building, participating in the development and feedback of what we're building, as well as in helping deliver that for like a GTM perspective. And last but not least, and we've talked a little bit about this earlier, training the team on what it means to be an effective product manager, product designer, user research, et cetera, at Eventbrite.

(37:36):
And then of course hiring people who can augment our existing team on everything I just mentioned, so I'm accountable for what we build driving value for the business. And there's of course going to be many times where what we build doesn't end up driving value. It's hard to predict sometimes, but it's my job to improve that conversion rate and the magnitude of impact over time. It might not be that everything we build delivers value, but I want most of it to, and I want the impact of that value to be higher and higher over time. You also asked about what it takes to get to the CPO role. And I think my journey's been more irregular than most of the people you probably talk to. Product management when I started my career, it was all a waterfall. It was built around massive releases, it was a totally different job from what we do now. Marketing was a lot more agile in the lowercase sense of agile and it mapped to my mind better as someone who's really influenced by the book, The Goal.

(38:40):
I think the tangible pieces of advice to get to this level that may be helpful is I always focused on where I thought there was leverage. I wanted to learn everything I could and focus on the things that had a big impact regardless of the org structure or the career path that meant, I wanted to really have a deep understanding of the entire business so I knew just what was worth focusing on to help the business. I think one of the things that's different about being a chief product officer versus other product roles is how much of a company leadership role it is versus a functional leadership role. You're expected in this role to optimize for the entire company, even at the expense of what's good for your team, so you really have to learn how to optimize for company first. That's like a key thing to learn that I think new executives can struggle with. And what advantage I think I had is I've basically been working with executives since my first job at apartments.com, so I learned to speak their language and understood what they cared about pretty early in my career.

(39:47):
And this is a really important element, assume that questions from them are them trying to learn versus them assuming you don't know something and testing you about it. I find that a lot of people get intimidated by executive questions when the executive is just trying to understand things. And then that changes the interaction you can have. The other element that served me well was just refusing to specialize. I thought if I could learn all the skills that would allow me to combine them to work on the most important things versus only work on the thing I knew how to work on. And that definitely led to slower visible progress in terms of career growth or titles, but it was a much faster path to the true executive role because I could speak better with CEOs about more topics than most of my peers. Obviously this is all my individual experience there are many paths to get to this type of level, but those are some things that have worked for me.

Lenny (40:45):
That was such an incredible definition and so much good advice there. And this is a good segue to another area that you have a really interesting insight on around the spectrum of product people. When I think of you, I think of two by twos and this is I think just a spectrum, which is unusual for Casey framework.

Casey Winters (41:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (41:01):
I'd love to hear your take on how you think about the spectrum and around up-scaling PMs to move along that spectrum?

Casey Winters (41:06):
The idea is, and this is something I was inspired from talking with Omar who runs product at Cambly. He used to run core product at Pinterest. It's this idea of any product team is like a gang of misfits, they all come from different backgrounds. Most people didn't start as a product manager, their first job, they might have been in sales, or in marketing, or analytics, or engineering, right. Everyone's bringing these different skill sets to the table. But the main spectrum that I've observed in product teams of any decent size is that you have two extreme types of product managers per se, and on perhaps the left side of the spectrum you have the crazy innovator types, they have so many different ideas, they pay attention to every single change in the industry, they all know all about the latest Apple API or Snapchat's latest product feature.

(42:06):
Those people are going to have ideas all the time. Actually, probably most of those ideas are going to be bad, but one out of ten's going to be just a game changer and they're generally not super great at turning that idea into action. And then on the extreme right side of the spectrum will be your typical executional focused PM, and they can do a really good job of taking a strong strategy and turning it into action that creates value for the customer, but they generally don't know what's going on in the industry. They can't think of a totally new product idea themselves. They're going to need support from above to be able to push them in the right direction and then they got it from there. When you think about recruiting, what we all want as CPOs in terms of people we bring into our team is we want people in the middle. We want people who are strategic, they understand what's going on in the industry, they can generate some good ideas, but they can also turn it into something real that delivers value for the customer and the company.

(43:08):
And there just aren't a ton of those people in the world. Not as many as we would like to recruit, so as a product leader, if I'm airing on the side of which side of the spectrum I want people from, I generally will take people who are good at execution over people who are good at generating ideas, because of course there's always too many good ideas that a company need to focus and execute well on the best ones. Whereas if I were a VC, I would probably bias to the people on the left because I don't need every company to work. If I invest in 10 different entrepreneurs who have crazy ideas and one of them works and becomes the next Airbnb, turns out I've done incredibly well as a venture capitalist. The challenge you practically deal with as a product leader is you end up recruiting, and managing, and growing a lot of executional people who can get stuff done, but if they want to get to the director level or if they want to get to my level, they need to get more strategic.

(44:06):
And we don't have good ways to turn great executors into great strategists as in general, like a product function, so I've started investing in a lot of different things here. Obviously I've built some programs for Reforge around product strategy. A lot of my team goes to those to try to learn. I've also been doing a lot of mentorship with the team to try to teach them what it looks like to do that well. I've had people come in to speak with the team like you and many other great product folks to show my team what great looks like and how people like you developed your skills. And I'm trying lots of different things to try to move more of the team to the middle, where they can be that optimal strategist that still retains that ability to deliver great value on top of the strategy versus just have ideas that can't be executed on. And it's definitely a work in progress, it's a lot of different tactics to try to build that skill set inside the team and scale it. And definitely something I feel like I'm still working on.

Lenny (45:11):
What I'm hearing is a lot of kind of the biggest upside for PMs to develop is basically to become more strategic and all the things you've shared are just ways or a lot of ways to just become better at strategies. It's interesting that that's like what you found to be the most essential piece for PMs to often level up at.

Casey Winters (45:30):
Like you said, it depends on the level, right. Early on in your career as a PM, you're going to get the most value by showing that you can ship real things to customers and that the customers like them, like that's by far the most important thing. But if you want to start managing groups of PMs, if you want to start a running a business unit, or a pillar, or a theme. I as a chief product officer, I'm going to expect you to be able to write that strategy doc without me. And you know what I found, whether it's through the advising roles or through coming into Eventbrite is just a lot of people couldn't do that step.

(46:04):
And that means when you try to become a product leader at the company and the CEO expects that from you and you can't do it, you're going to set yourself up to really cap hard on how fast your career can grow. And you'll get stuck, whether it's at the senior product manager level or at the group PM level, because you can't show that you can drive decision making on your own and that you can push forward new ideas that are going to help the company, so that's definitely where I've seen the biggest bottleneck in terms of skill sets. Obviously there's lots of important skill sets you want to build as a PM, but that one to get to the top is the great filter.

Lenny (46:40):
That's awesome advice for folks listening that are trying to figure out what should I work on? It's kind of simple a lot of times just get better at strategy and it feels like it elevates you in so many other ways.

Casey Winters (46:49):
Yeah, and of course we could talk for hours about what it means to get better at strategy and some of the tactics there.

Lenny (46:54):
It could be a follow up.

Casey Winters (46:56):
Because I know some PMs who struggle with that.

Lenny (46:56):
Follow up.

Casey Winters (46:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (46:58):
Okay.

Casey Winters (46:59):
Podcast number two.

Lenny (46:59):
Podcast number two, let's book it. Okay, so I can't let you go without talking about growth. Everyone's always trying to figure out how do we grow our company?

Casey Winters (46:59):
Right.

Lenny (47:07):
What can we do to accelerate growth? I know you're modest, but I think you're one of the smartest people in the world on this stuff. And so I just want to touch on a couple things in the time that we have here. One is with paid growth becoming increasingly more expensive and difficult, especially with Apple's recent changes.

Casey Winters (47:24):
Yep.

Lenny (47:24):
SEO forever becoming more crowded, sales being always expensive. It's just tough out there for a lot of startups to grow. Are you seeing any interesting or new growth channels or tactics that folks can explore or consider that maybe work for companies that you're looking at?

Casey Winters (47:43):
It's not that there are new channels per se, unless you include tokens from like Web3, which I do not. It's more that there are ways to get leverage on your channels through better flows or lifetime value that companies are figuring out. For example, at Eventbrite, we unified what we're separate direct response and lead generation flows in our performance marketing to acquire creators. And now it just takes less effort, we're getting better CPAs and sales now has the opportunity to pick up any product qualified lead from a direct response customer who may need a little bit more help, and they have the data to now determine if there's high enough value to justify it.

(48:27):
This concept is being dubbed, product led sales. And it's this idea that you can unify self-service loops in a B2B business, which are typically driven by product and your sales loops into one more complex giant loop that operates more efficiently and breaks down the silos. And I think you're going to see an explosion in B2B companies that learn how to unlock that and get sales, and product, and marketing to be working as one larger cross-functional team and building an engine that optimizes all of their skill sets, so that's something I'm pretty excited about, but we're definitely in the early days there.

Lenny (49:02):
That's awesome. I was going to ask you if there's any trends you're seeing around growth and clearly that's one. Are there any other trends, just things happening in the growth world?

Casey Winters (49:12):
Yeah, sure. I think there was this conventional wisdom to just focus on building until you found product market fit and then you can worry about growth. And of course there's some truth in that statement, but now as I'm talking with more and more founders and I'm sure you're seeing this yourself, is we're seeing founders who are thinking about building growth loops into their product before they find product market fit. And it's not so that they can prematurely scale before they have product market fit. It's so that when they find product market fit, they have that built in distribution advantage to grow once they're ready. And founders are starting to intuit what I've written about a bit as well as you, which is that scalable acquisition or what we call an acquisition loop is a requirement for product market fit.

(49:59):
Like if you got a product that retains well and you can't find more users for it, I don't think that's product market fit, so it's really exciting to see that evolution and to see founders think about like it's not about getting a bunch of users before you have a product that works. It's about thinking strategically about how this product's going to grow itself when it's ready to do so. I'm really excited to see the next generation of founders build that muscle early on and also leverage it when they're ready instead of just like, oh, I'm going to throw a bunch of paid ads at it and it's going to work, so that's something I'm really excited about.

Lenny (50:31):
On that topic, when should companies focus on growth? And as a second question, when do you think they should hire a head of growth or someone full-time focused on growth?

Casey Winters (50:40):
Like I mentioned, well, you don't want to focus on growth before product worked fit. You want to be thinking about how your product can grow scalable pretty early on, so early growth definitely needs to be done by the founders. I tend to separate growth into two phases. I call the first phase kindle strategies, these are those non-scalable hacks to get your early users. And I think those are generally done by founders, maybe some early team members. Fire strategies are the ones that drive scale, that's what you were mentioning, content loops, sales loops, viral loops, paid acquisition. And to me, the goal of your kindle strategies, these like non scalable hacks they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users.

(51:24):
And it's once you unlock a fire strategy, that's when I think you think about hiring someone full time on growth to fully harness that new growth loop you've built. That could be a salesperson, if it's sales. It could be growth PM, if it's viral or you just see content. Or it could be a performance marketer if it's ads, but it's once it's like, okay, we've sequenced to a growth strategy that actually scales. Let's go find someone who's awesome at that who can make it 10X better. That's how I think about it.

Lenny (51:51):
Maybe a last question, is there is kind of an underappreciated or under invested in growth strategy, growth tactic, things that you're just like, oh wow, this seems to be working better than people may think.

Casey Winters (52:03):
Yeah. Well, I still think data network effects are underrated. I think a lot of people confuse the idea of data network effects with data as a product you can charge people for, especially like businesses. And I get it a lot of businesses like you can't charge them for data because they don't know how to use data super well, especially SMBs. But what data network effects are, is leveraging product usage data to make the product value stronger and stronger over time. That could be personalized results in the case of Pinterest or in the case of Eventbrite, better targeting data for advertising to find people who are more likely to be interested in your event. And I think especially with Facebook and Apple's platform changes your product being able to generate its own data, versus just relying on the big platforms to do all the work for you. That's a real edge that companies are starting to wake up to. And it's obviously something that's worked well for me in the past at Pinterest and certainly now at Eventbrite.

Lenny (53:02):
There's a couple questions that I had at the top that I skipped that I thought I'd come back to. I know that you're a big video game guy and I love that at the bottom of your post, you always share the music that you're listening to, so I was just going to ask what's the game you're playing these days. Anything you recommend and then what are you listening to?

Casey Winters (53:18):
Yeah, I'm currently playing Cyberpunk 2077 on the PS5, which is fun. But I recently finished Horizon Forbidden West and that was excellent, really great science fiction game. On the music side, one of my favorite bands is this band called Broadcast and they never really played live a whole lot and their singer died a few years ago, but they recently came out with a recording of a bunch of their live sessions that they recorded on the BBC. And it's like getting this time capsule from the past of some of their early live sessions. That's been really great, so I've been enjoining that record quite a lot lately.

Lenny (54:02):
Awesome. Casey's picks get them here, get them here now. Casey, I feel like I was successful in extracting many nuggets in our hour together, I really appreciate your time. Where can folks find you online and how can people that are listening be helpful to you?

Casey Winters (54:17):
Blog@caseyaccidental.com, I'm semi-active on Twitter @onecaseman, and always I focus on paying it forward, like help the next generation of companies, of PMs, of marketers, get better at their craft and build better businesses. And if you're searching for a cool event, check out the Eventbrite App of course, we always would appreciate that.

Lenny (54:43):
Love it. Amazing Casey, what a great way to end it. Thank you again for being here.

Casey Winters (54:48):
Thanks so much.

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00:00):
Every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

Lenny (00:00:41):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Casey Winters. Casey was one of the first ever guests on the podcast, and the first to make a return appearance. He's a legend in the growth and product community, having worked with or advised companies like Pinterest, Reddit, Canva, Airbnb, Tinder, Thumbtack, Grubhub, and many more. He recently led product at Eventbrite for just about three years, and recently returned to full-time advising, and he's exploring new opportunities.

(00:01:17):
In our chat, we cover something he calls the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager and how to avoid that, what he's found works best when interviewing product managers, what impact he expects from GPT-4 on the role of product management, when to trust your instincts versus your team's insights and instincts, what are all the different kinds of network effects, and how do you effectively leverage them? Plus a great story about what Grubhub missed that let DoorDash and Uber eat their lunch. I always learn so much from chatting with Casey, and I am 100% sure you will learn a lot from this episode. With that, I bring you Casey Winters, after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but if there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack, this leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. 

(00:02:52):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead use your North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. 

(00:03:37):
Casey, welcome back to the podcast.

Casey Winters (00:03:39):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:03:41):
You are the first ever return guest to my podcast. How does that feel?

Casey Winters (00:03:46):
I feel honored, perhaps a bit unworthy, but I'll go with it.

Lenny (00:03:52):
Well, you're both worthy and I'm honored as well. Thanks for joining me again. I have a lot of stuff that I want to chat about, but first of all, I'm just curious, what are you up to these days? I know you left Eventbrite as CPO, I know you're doing a few advisorships with startups, but how are you spending your days, and what do you think is next for Casey Winters?

Casey Winters (00:04:10):
I'm still spending some time with Whatnot and Eventbrite as  advisors. I stepped back from the CPO of Eventbrite in October, but still working on some long-term marketplace strategy stuff, some growth strategy stuff. I'm on the board of a company called Beek, which is like Netflix for audio in Latin America, and I'm doing some angel investing in marketplaces in what I call tech debt as a service, which is what are startups that are building out things that were hard for my teams in the past to build or maintain inside previous companies? The other thing I'm working on is revamping the product strategy program for Reforge. I got some things keeping me busy, but definitely not as busy as I was last year.

Lenny (00:04:53):
This is like a rare, free agent Case Winters time. Should people reach out if they're interested in maybe working with you? What's your advice for people listening?

Casey Winters (00:05:00):
Yeah. I always love seeing how I can help companies. Everyone should err on the side of reaching out and seeing if I have time to help, if there's something they think I can help with. I love talking to startups, so yeah, absolutely. I can't promise anything, but yeah, I just love talking to people about this stuff.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Awesome. We'll point people to how to get in touch with you at the end of the episode, and it'll be in the show notes too. Talking about the CPO role, you're at Eventbrite. You're a CPO. It reminds me of a post you wrote about how hard the CPO role is. There's some quotes that I recall in your post about how, one, if you ever ask a CPO, chief product officer how they're doing, no one's ever going to say, "I'm crushing it right now."

Casey Winters (00:05:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:05:41):
Then there's this other quote about how you basically, as a CPO, just try to put some points on the board before you inevitably get fired. Why is that? Why do you find that, and do you still believe that to be true after leaving that role? 

Casey Winters (00:05:53):
Yeah, I would say I still believe those things I said. It was funny. A product leader who will remain nameless emailed me when I hit year three at Eventbrite, and they said, "Congrats. You didn't get fired after two years. What's your secret?" I think it's very hard to keep product-market fit as a CPO within a company for a long time. The needs of the business shift over time, and of course, we all have different strengths and weaknesses in our game. No one's perfect at everything. In general, as an executive, it's just impossible to do everything perfectly, and any little misstep, mistake, or something you just missed can blow up in a major way. 

(00:06:33):
Frequently, CEOs have visions that can change and get misaligned with the product leader. Also, with leadership roles, you don't get put on a PIP. If a CEO loses confidence, it's over immediately. Nothing like that happened at Eventbrite. I started to see that the areas of leverage for a product leader were just less in my wheelhouse over time. I just talked to my boss about it, and we worked out something where I continue to advise on the things that I'm uniquely good at, and find other people who are better at some of these other things that were maybe more important at the time.

(00:07:09):
Yeah, I'd say it's a really hard role, or a really challenging role. It can be a lot of fun. I learned a lot from doing it, but yeah, I still believe, and I think I've still yet to hear someone say they've really crushed it. 

Lenny (00:07:26):
Is there anything that you learned from that experience to have survived in that role for three years? I imagine you have a lot of skills and you were very valuable to the company, but I don't know, for someone in that's role maybe right now, just like, "Here's something that I did that maybe you should do." 

Casey Winters (00:07:40):
The first one I can think of is a big change from being a product leader to a CPO or something equivalent is you're actually a company exec first and a product exec second. I think some mistakes I made early that I corrected successfully is you want to show that you are caring and paying attention to the overall business first before just taking care of your own product designers, product managers, researchers, whoever. That's advice I found myself doling out to other product leaders a lot more now that I've gone through it. You have to not only truly care, but create the perception that you care about sales, about marketing, about legal, et cetera. Because first and foremost, you're expected to lead the business at that level, so I think that's something that I think is really important.

(00:08:35):
I think something else is really trying to diagnose, without as much bias as possible, where are the strengths and weaknesses of your team? Where are the strengths and weaknesses of your product? Lay that out with your peers and say, "Here's where we are. Here's where I think we need to go. Here's the timeline on which I'm going to work to get us there." Because I think product's such a confusing discipline for people who aren't in it, like a sales leader, many CEOs, a marketing leader, that they don't necessarily know what great looks like. 

(00:09:14):
The things they know about great leadership, they don't know if you know those things, so you have to make it really clear, "Yeah, I know our OKRs are not as quantitative as they should be yet. That's because this team isn't ready for X, Y, and Z. This is where we're going to get them to, but it's going to take some time." One of the things we did at Eventbrite that I thought was really helpful is, when you go public, you tend to rotate over your executive team and get public company execs versus startup execs. A few of us were new, and it's just like, "Hey, let's do a deep dive on product. Let's do a deep dive on customer support. Where's it at right now? What do you feel like your job is? What do you feel like are the issues you're facing? Where do you want to take it over the next three to five years? Then, let's talk about it."

(00:09:57):
Just forcing you to write it all down is really helpful, but then it forces you to explain it. It helps the rest of the executive team get better company execs because now they really understand product a lot more deeply, or understand finance a lot more deeply, whatever the function is.  

Lenny (00:10:15):
Speaking of gaps and opportunities for people in the company to level up, you've been highlighting this trend that I thought was really interesting, something you call the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager. Can you talk about what that is and what you've been noticing?

Casey Winters (00:10:33):
Yeah, sure thing. This is something I started noticing while managing PMs and product designers at Eventbrite, and it's now coming up with Whatnot as I help them hire new PMs, is the environment in which a lot of product managers have come up is very distorted from when you and I started doing this kind of work. I think we used to always describe PMs as this gang of misfits. We all started in all different functions. We all had different strengths and weaknesses, and the PM team gained as a whole from that diversity of skills and previous experiences.

(00:11:12):
What I noticed is, when we started doing product reviews at Eventbrite, if there was any sort of uncertainty in a problem or a solution, the product manager, instead of shipping to learn, would talk about all this research they have to do to really learn the problems, really learn the solution. 

(00:11:30):
My feedback would be like, no, user research is a scarce resource. We have to reserve it for the areas that have extreme uncertainty and high leverage for getting to certain, so if you're redesigning the login page for Eventbrite, you don't need to use that resource to learn what to do. Just go see what FANG and the top unicorns did. They probably did a good job, and even if they didn't, all of our customers also use those products, so they're going to be familiar with us copying any approach that they've taken.

(00:12:05):
I think we sort of forgot in the industry that many times, the fastest way to learn is to ship, so that if you actually get them to skip research and just go look at competitors, another thing I was noticing is I'd get a list of options other companies have done, but there would be no analysis of why those companies chose different options and what's most applicable for us. 

(00:12:31):
It got me thinking, okay, every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

(00:13:10):
At one point, I got so fed up, I wrote an internal blog post, and I called it On Best Practices and Breakfast Rituals. I talked about how there were these articles about the morning habits of the most successful people, and if you try to do all those things, it'd take you like six hours every morning. There was this article, I think it was on Business Insider or something, about this futurist at Google. He talked about all the pills and food he eats for breakfast every morning to try to live longer. The reporter estimated that it cost him one million a year to have these habits, so I was like, "Hey, I want to make it clear. At Eventbrite, we don't have that much money. We don't have that much time. There's no framework that allows you to not use your brain at this company and just follow some sort of process for success in this profession."

(00:14:02):
I adopted this thing into a public blog post that's on my blog now, but now that I've had some time outside of Eventbrite, I feel like I at least partially missed the mark on what's really going on. I see this with Whatnot, because one of the things I'm helping them with is interviewing, I see PMs again, which I haven't done in a while. It's fascinating interviewing a PM or managers early in their career because Whatnot is a startup, and you know better than most of us as a former founder of one, startups typically require us to wear lots of hats. You have to write SQL. You have to talk directly to customers. You have to prep marketing and sales. Most importantly, you have to make a lot of decisions under uncertainty, which you wouldn't necessarily expect a PM to do at, say, a Google, but it all boils down to using your brain in different ways.

(00:14:54):
Lisa, who's on our legal team, she called Eventbrite a public startup because the pandemic basically erased her business and we had to build it back from scratch. Now that I'm doing these interviews, and whether they come from a small startup, a unicorn, or a public company, they all sort of look the same because there's been so much funding to all these companies. Every company's been acting like they're Google with Google margins, meaning a lot of engineering support, a lot of design support, a lot of research support, lots of analysts around them.

(00:15:22):
They actually seem pretty ill-prepared for a real startup, or even a public company with some uncertainty around it like Eventbrite, so you start getting these weird responses in the interview process. You ask them to solve a problem and they'd say things like, "I can't even begin to come up with solutions until I see all the data and talk to customers." I'm like, "Yeah, I get that's something you would normally do if you took the job, but you don't have the data. You can't talk to customers. Make a decision now. What would you do? I want to see how creative you are. I want to see how much you're intuiting about the real problem and solution," and they can't really answer. 

(00:15:56):
Then my follow-up, which I don't ask, but what I really want to ask is like, "When's the last time you used your brain versus followed a process someone else designed at your company?" Because I want the former, not the latter.

Lenny (00:16:09):
Wow. Amazing. There's a lot of things I want to dig into here. I was going to ask why you call it zero interest rate phenomenon, but I think what I'm hearing is it's when interest rates are zero, everyone's got a lot of money, things are going great. Everyone looks like they're killing it, successful. Everyone thinks they've got it all figured out, and then when that goes away, it's like, "Oh, shit. Maybe not so." 

Casey Winters (00:16:27):
Then also, I think zero interest rates allowed every startup to operate like it was a public company with billions of dollars. That's going to go away over the next five years, and it sort of takes us back to what product management used to be like, which was you didn't have all these resources around. You didn't have all this time to figure it out because if you don't figure it out now and make it work, you may run out of funding, right?

Lenny (00:16:51):
Yeah. Like a very concrete thing that's changed as a lot of research teams have been laid off because they grew really large and companies found, "Maybe we need don't need the ..." Like, "Of all the things we can cut, it's probably an area we can cut." 

Casey Winters (00:17:02):
Yeah, for sure. 

Lenny (00:17:04):
There's probably PMs listening to this wondering, "Shoot, am I one of these? Am I just following a bunch of frameworks?" What's your advice for someone that may fear that, "Oh, shoot. This is maybe who I am and I don't want to necessarily be this"? What could they maybe do?

Casey Winters (00:17:17):
I always advise going to companies where you can learn quickly and try things. I think it's certainly okay to learn a bunch of frameworks. There's a reason I've invested a ton of time in Reforge because I think it actually really does help people to see how other people build things in a way that they can scale it to their other companies, but you have to understand that the job is not to follow the process. The job is not to learn every framework possible. The job is to figure out how to add value to customers that translates into value to the business. Just reorient your North Star, if you've gotten away from that.

(00:17:53):
When I joined Eventbrite, there was this team that didn't ship anything in a quarter. I went to the designer who I knew, and I know that he likes to get stuff out there and likes to get feedback. I was like, "Dude, you didn't ship anything. How could you have gone the entire quarter, not shipped any of your designs and felt that that was okay? If you didn't feel it was okay, why did you censor yourself? Come to me. Tell me why this team is not letting you ship. There's just no way you can get better as a designer. There's no way you can have the impact on the company. There's no way you can have an impact on our users." Those are some things that come to mind to that question.

Lenny (00:18:36):
If you're a PM on a team that maybe isn't shipping, maybe is overusing research, do you have any advice of just like when it makes sense to invest in research? Say you have the resources, is there a rule of thumb you have of like, "Okay. Let's actually spend the time on this verse not"? 

Casey Winters (00:18:51):
I think about it a little bit, depending on the type of job you have and the types of customers you have. The more scale you have tends to be you have less sophisticated customers because you're generally like a consumer thing where the customers are rational. They're not experts. That's generally where you just try things. You measure the impact they have, and you only really bring in USEARCH, research when the impact seems confusing, but you can run experiments. You can get data really easily, so bias towards getting stuff out there and seeing what users respond to.

Lenny (00:19:30):
In consumer product.

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
Right. 

Lenny (00:19:31):
Interesting. 

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
If you're super enterprise, it's the opposite. Each customer, first off, is sophisticated and tend to be rational. They're paying you like six figures or more, and you could talk to the customers and sales, who knows the customers really well directly, and they tell you want they want. They tell you what they're willing to pay for. You build it. They pay you. Bing, bang, boom. It's not, obviously, as simple as that, but you're basically doing the research directly with the customer and with the sales team, and translating that into things that are strategic to the business.

(00:20:02):
I would say those are the two extremes probably most people are familiar with, but we now have a lot of companies in the middle, where they have more customers. Those customers are more sophisticated. They're consumers. They're maybe employees at companies, or they're small businesses. That's where you have to be more nuanced. This, of course, is where Eventbrite was on, "Hey, when do I really lean in on research? When do I lean in on data? When do I pay attention to internal feedback?

(00:20:29):
" For Eventbrite, we really tried to focus research on the B2B side of Eventbrite, where the problems seemed big, but not well-defined enough. Or that problem's well-defined, but we just really don't feel like we have the right solution yet. If research is going to be a scarce resource inside the company, which I think it will in most places, you have to figure out where it's a high-leverage area, which means either really big problem, we don't understand it well enough, or we know the problem's big. We understand it well, but we're just not sure if our solution's going to, in any way, hit the mark. 

Lenny (00:21:06):
Makes me think about some of the best researchers I've worked with, and they often tell me like, "We don't need to do research on this. We have enough information. We have other things we should be doing."

Casey Winters (00:21:13):
I love it when they say that. Yes.

Lenny (00:21:15):
Yeah. This would have been a really good segue to another topic I want to talk about, which is around gut instincts versus team expertise, which we're going to get to, but I have a couple more questions along these lines. 

Casey Winters (00:21:24):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:21:25):
You talked about interviewing PMs at Whatnot. Can you actually describe Whatnot? Just because you mentioned it a couple times, just so people know what we're talking about here.

Casey Winters (00:21:33):
Oh, sure. Whatnot's a livestreaming marketplace, mostly focused on the collectibles market. Sellers, whether it's like baseball cards, or women's handbags, or sneakers, they'll go live on video and show you the products they have that they're selling. People that are watching the stream can engage with the sellers and bid on different items, so kind of like Twitch meets eBay would be a good way to describe it. 

Lenny (00:21:54):
Awesome, awesome. I'll just mention, I'm a tiny angel investor in that company. 

Casey Winters (00:21:56):
Oh, that's why you brought it up. Okay, I get it.

Lenny (00:22:00):
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure people understood what this word was because it's like a fun word, Whatnot. What I wanted to actually get to is you said you were interviewing a lot of project managers for them.

Casey Winters (00:22:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:09):
What is your approach to interviewing PMs? What do you find is a really good signal for someone that's going to be successful?

Casey Winters (00:22:14):
I feel like the whole thing's gotten so performative. It's like interviewing is handing out Oscars based on who's prepared the best tell me about a time response, versus actually assessing who can do the job we're hiring for. It's like most PMs are better PM interviewers than PMs now. There's this quote from a movie called The Way of the Gun. I don't know if you've ever seen it.

Lenny (00:22:35):
No.

Casey Winters (00:22:36):
Benicio del Toro says in it, it's like, "These days, they want to be criminals more than they want to commit crime." I think about that quote a lot when it comes to interviewing. I would say I'm a bit contrarian here in my approach. I don't ask about your work history. I don't care about your perfectly practiced answers. I'm going to give you real scenarios that I expect from the role. I want to hear how you'd approach them. If you can't come up with a few reasonable ideas, figure out how to test them quickly without analyst support or research, I'm just not interested.

(00:23:10):
I'm not saying this is a perfect approach. Interviewing is a very lossy format, but the more I can see them do the job we're hiring for with questions, whether it's a presentation, a prompt, that gets me the most comfortable that they know the job they're signing up for, that they've shown in a practice scenario they can do it, and they actually enjoyed it in some way.

Lenny (00:23:29):
Are there red flags you look for in these interviews? One is maybe you said of like, "I can't even begin to answer this without research and data." Is there anything else?

Casey Winters (00:23:36):
Some things I pay attention to is if they're talking about solutions that are going to take a long time to get signal from, whether it's months and months of engineering time before you actually see the impact on users or the business, I think that's always great. If they're not factoring in the amount of time it will take, in general, is not a good sign, and not thinking a bit more holistically about the types of metrics they expect to improve versus track to make sure they haven't gone down. Those are some things that I pay a lot of attention to.

Lenny (00:24:11):
How much do you think they're intimidated by being interviewed by Casey Winters? How much do you think that factors in?

Casey Winters (00:24:16):
I think you overestimate my importance or awareness in the community. I think most people have no idea who I am when they start talking to me.

Lenny (00:24:25):
Mm-hmm. [inaudible 00:24:25] Another thought is there's this meme that GBT-4, or 5, or 6, or 10 is going to replace product managers, and anytime some new feature comes out, people will put out these videos of, "Oh, look. They're doing all the PM's jobs." What's your take on the future of PM in AI, if any?

Casey Winters (00:24:41):
Well, I think if you thought the PM job was just filling in the latest Reforge or Shreyas framework, and then getting that automatic FANG promotion every year and a half, then yeah, you're going to get replaced by AI. I think the real PM job is the least likely to get replaced over time because you need real subject matter expertise. You need to be trading off a lot of different types of things, and making good decisions for the company and for your customers. 

(00:25:10):
In terms of using AI now as a PM, I'd actually be cautious in the current iteration of the cycle for PMs. It's a tool that's trained on sounding smart rather than always necessarily being smart. I was at Eventbrite the other day, and someone was telling me how they were loving the new Notion AI integration. She asked me if I used it. I said, "No." She's like, "Ah, you totally need to. Hey, go ask it your bio. It's really cool." I said, "All right. Let's just do it on your screen," so she did and my bio said I started my career at Google, and worked on Google Trends, and a bunch of other products, none of which happened. It was just complete nonsense.

(00:25:52):
It did have some stuff that did happen. It knew I worked at Eventbrite, and it knew I worked at Pinterest and stuff, but half of it was just completely made up. It sounded plausible, but it wasn't actually true. I think where I'm more inclined for PMs to try to get leverage out of something like GPT-4 is a lot of the tedious work that's maybe not their specialty to begin with. If you're not great at Excel or Google Sheets and you need to model something, you can ask it to format something. That'll probably be perfect, or how to get some Zapier integration to work. It probably knows how to do that really well.

(00:26:28):
I think, at this point, it's a pretty good no-code to low-code tool. It's obviously going to become a lot more than that, but for a lot of these other use cases that people are touting, there's a decent chance, confidently tells you the wrong thing, and that would scare me as a PM. 

Lenny (00:26:45):
I've had the exact same experience. I had to describe what I've done, and it was like 70% mistaken. 

Casey Winters (00:26:52):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:26:53):
Is there anything you've found value in yet with GPT of any kind in your work, or is it still kind of just poking around and novelty for you?

Casey Winters (00:27:00):
Yeah. I've had a couple of those things where it's like, "Hey, how do I actually get this weird thing done?" It's been like clear bullet points, take these steps, and I'm like, "Oh, great. This was actually really hard to find on Google." Things like that, I actually quite like it for, so that's where my head goes to more confidently use it. Of course, I'll try it and if it's wrong-

Lenny (00:27:24):
Just throw it away. 

Casey Winters (00:27:25):
... I'll learn where it's wrong, so it's low-risk, but it's been right on some of those things and it's like, "Oh, cool. I couldn't figure out how to do that." There was something on Google Docs that I needed to figure out how to do that was kind of fancy. I asked ChatGPT. It told me how to do it, and I was like, "Oh, great." 

Lenny (00:27:39):
I had a similar experience where I just needed a formula in Google Sheets, and just told it like, "I need this thing," and it just gives me the actual formula. 

Casey Winters (00:27:45):
Yeah, that's so magical when it happens. 

Lenny (00:27:47):
Yeah. I don't know. I'm not that good with Sheets formulas. Shifting course a little bit, you also wrote this really interesting post on founder intuition versus team expertise. There's a lot to it, and I think it's a really interesting topic because it's this classic discussion that startups have. How much should a founder trust their gut, and how much should it be top-down, "Here's what we should be doing" versus the team, bottom-up, figure out what to build? I'd love to spend a little time here. Maybe just to start broadly, what is this? You came up with a framework of how to think about when founder intuition should overrule, say, team expertise, and how that change over time, so maybe just talk about that. 

Casey Winters (00:28:26):
Yeah. If founders are lucky/good enough to find product-market fit, they've usually built up all this intuition about their customers, about their product, and their business that are really hard to explain to others and may even be subconscious. When they start to hire people, these people will come in with a lot of excitement, ideas, maybe even really relevant experience, especially senior leaders. I've seen some founders are like, "Cool. I need to let these experts start to own these areas and get out of the geek house." I think that's actually the opposite of what you want, because none of these people know the business as well as you get it. You actually need to direct them until they show you they've really got it and are making better decisions than you would. 

(00:29:17):
This is not a founder example, but I remember when I hired Erika Warren to build out our loyalty program at Grubhub, and she now leads growth at Change.org. After a month or so, she was like, "Dude, you're in all my meetings. I got this." That let me know she was in a different part of the situational leadership framework than I had put her in, so I backed away, and she crushed it from there.

(00:29:40):
Founders will put a lot of new leaders in that delegate bucket too quickly. It's like, "Ah, they got it. They know more than me," when founders actually know the right answer and should just tell them. This can, of course, change like in the case of Erika. If you hire the right people, they do get smarter than you. You can and you should start delegating. Many founders don't notice the signals where their founder intuition has been usurped by team expertise, or maybe it's just ebbed in effectiveness over time. That, of course, makes sense. Founders have all these different things they're dealing with, and your employees can really dive deep in certain areas. I encourage employees to proactively signal both directions, like, "Hey, I need direction from you." Or, "Hey, I got it from here. Trust me on this one."

Lenny (00:30:27):
Interesting. You're saying, as a founder, the heuristic should be if you feel confident about a decision, generally, you should be clear, like, "Hey, I think I know what we need to be doing here," and don't just make people feel better, necessarily, by just saying, "Okay. You tell us what you want to do." Then on the flip side, as an employee at the company, if you feel really confident about something, make it clear to the founder like, "I really think this is the right move." Is there anything more you want to add there?

Casey Winters (00:30:55):
Yeah. Well, there's obviously the feedback loop of that, of what happens when you do either of those things. Depending on the founder's response to that or the employee's response to that, there's different approaches you can take.

Lenny (00:31:13):
Part of this, you have this cool chart of just over time, the founder expertise becomes less and less relevant. I guess, is that because they just don't spend as much time with the customers because they have other stuff going on or they hire people that are smarter, and then over time, the team expertise goes up?

Casey Winters (00:31:26):
If you're lucky enough to scale a company, there's just more and more things going on that all will reach the founder in some way, but it means more breadth and less depth on any particular issue, and the reverse is true for people you hire. They're able to get really deep into things that maybe you were really deep into two years ago but you just can't stay deep in anymore. I built this chart on, or I guess I should say table on the different phases of a startup. When you're finding product-market fit, everything goes through the founders. You cannot outsource that.

(00:32:08):
Then when you start scaling the company because you found product-market fit, it's the first time that founders run into this classic problem of what got you here won't get you there. What got you to product-market fit was iterating on product and doing things that don't scale. Guess what? You found a product that works. Don't do that anymore. Make it scale. Don't come up with new products. You found the one that works. The reason I came up with this framework originally is when I was at Grubhub, we were scaling pretty nicely and fairly organically. 

(00:32:39):
I think Mike and Matt, the founders, had intuited these phases of building a company pretty well, but we acquired a competitor and I saw how that company we acquired operated. Even though they were largely in the same phase as us, they still operated like they were founding the company. Everything was going through the founder. Intuitively, I was like, "Oh, this is why we're acquiring you, and not the other way around." 

(00:33:09):
I think it's really hard for founders to get those signals organically, and I think it's up to us as employees to help. The founders can listen to the signals or not listen to those signals, but that's part of why we're here, but we should also give those signals when we're confident we really get it. Not come in day one being, "I know what your sales strategy should be. You're doing it all wrong." Because chances are, the founders weren't doing it all wrong. They knew something you don't know about yet.

Lenny (00:33:34):
What is it that you think made it such that you won and they didn't? Is it because they didn't invest, they didn't shift to scaling and delegating to their employees as much as the founder just telling everyone to do it?

Casey Winters (00:33:43):
Correct, right. Everything was not moving as quickly because everything had to go through the same person to get done. It just allowed them to not launch as many markets, not sign up as many restaurants, to not figure out as many growth channels, yeah, as we had done.

Lenny (00:33:59):
Got it. They just bottlenecked themselves and they weren't able to move as fast because the founder thought they needed to make these decisions, and they were still the ones that knew everything.

Casey Winters (00:34:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:34:09):
That makes me think about most companies. Maybe not most, but many founders just believe they have the answers. They are confident they know what to do, and it's rare they get to a place of like, "Nah, I actually don't."

Casey Winters (00:34:22):
Well, I would say no one gets to it super intuitively.

Lenny (00:34:27):
Any advice for either as a employee at a company with a founder like that or leader, of just how to push back and help the founder understand, "Maybe you should let go and trust people to make decisions"?

Casey Winters (00:34:40):
I think the first thing is you have to understand that it's their company, not yours, and the founders have impossible jobs. They're not going to scale perfectly with the needs of the company. It's just something's going to be off. It may be because there's a whole lot of hubris by being the one of a thousand startups that made it, or they just have personal styles, but they can run the company any way they want.

(00:35:08):
I think it's sometimes surprising when founders actually want to run things suboptimally. I think we've seen examples where founders just want to build cool shit versus focusing on what customers want, or they're too obsessed with the design. They're always rebranding, redesigning things in ways that confuse customers. Of course, that's going to happen and those are some of the worst cases. I think if you do state your point, you've actually built up the expertise, you're confident and you are refuted for whatever reasons, you have to find ways to be contrarian and prove you're right. 

(00:35:43):
Different founders have different forms of feedback they listen to. It might be talking to other CEOs, or other operators, or trusted advisors, certain customers. Some might be very data-oriented, so you just run the experiment and ask for forgiveness after you proved it works, whatever. Everyone's got a different thing they respond to. You try to figure out what actually influences the CEO and build that case, whether it's through an experiment, the right customer intro, the right external advisor. If they rebuke that as well, then you got to disagree and commit, or find a new company to join, or start your own. Like I said, it's their company. They can make the call.

(00:36:25):
I remember when I joined Pinterest, I was just coming off 100X increase in user growth from Grubhub. I was ready to drive the same sort of impact at Pinterest, but no one knew who I was. I didn't come from Facebook or Google like most of the other people, or Pinterest. No one gave a shit about Chicago startups at the time, so when they didn't trust my proposals, I just went and talked to the heads of growth at all the startups they did respect. I talked to Dropbox, I talked to Facebook. When they said all the same things I was saying but I said that they said it, not me, that was, sadly, more convincing. I didn't care because I still got what I wanted out of it, which is to do the right thing to grow the company.

Lenny (00:37:09):
Now you're one of those people that people go to. If Casey says it, it's probably the right way to do it.

Casey Winters (00:37:13):
Whether I'm correct or not, it is a role I sometimes play in the ecosystem, I will admit.

Lenny (00:37:17):
Is there an example where you were convinced something was the right way to go and the founder at one of the companies you worked at had a different opinion and they had ended up being right.

Casey Winters (00:37:25):
When I was at Grubhub, one of the ideas one of the founders came up with was to build an app for delivery drivers. At the time, restaurants had their own delivery drivers. They did not work for us. We wanted to build an app for the delivery drivers so you could see where the food was along the way, so you could know if it's five minutes away, whatever. Domino's was the first to have done this at the time, and we thought that would make a bunch of sense.

(00:37:48):
I was just like, "How am I supposed to convince the delivery driver, who doesn't have a relationship with us, to download the app from Grubhub, to actually turn it on, to create anxiety for the consumer of they maybe didn't take the right turn or, whatever?" I was like, "I don't think this makes sense. No one's going to use it," and Mike and Matt overruled me and pushed us to do it. 

(00:38:10):
In the long run, it ended up being quite necessary because of the innovations around DoorDash, and Postmates, and later, Uber Eats having their own delivery network and us needing to counter that. That's, of course, a key piece of technology that needs to have parity with those new services. That was an area where perhaps, they were thinking a little bit more longer term than I was, and I was not able to get where they were going on the longer-term time horizon of how this would be actually ultimately adopted and useful.

Lenny (00:38:39):
This is an awesome segue to the next area, but real quick, how did they get drivers to start using this app? Was there anything really clever they did?

Casey Winters (00:38:45):
I think it was fairly low adoption for a while, and leveraging basically restaurant authority. If we're able to push on our restaurant customers effectively to say like, "Hey, if you use this, it'll get you more orders. We'll get you prominence in the UI," things like that to then push down to their direct relationships with the drivers to get them to adopt.

Lenny (00:39:10):

(00:40:00):
Okay. Shifting to our last topic that I was excited to chat about is around network effects, and marketplaces, and SaaS, and how those things connect. I feel like you have the clearest way of thinking about and explaining network effects, so maybe just to start, can you just simply explain what is a network effect and then the different types of network effects that exist?

Casey Winters (00:40:21):
Yeah. No pressure after you say that. Yeah, so at it's core, a network effect is when a product or a business gets better with more users or customers using it. There's three types that I tend to focus on. The first and probably the most well-known is called direct network effects. That's when every additional user makes the product better for all the existing users. When someone joins WhatsApp, other people can talk to them that wouldn't be able to talk to them before, and that makes WhatsApp valuable, more valuable for everyone.

(00:40:55):
Then there are cross-side network effects where there's two distinct types of users, and adding an additional user on one side of the network makes it more valuable for all the types of users on the other side of the network and vice-versa. When a restaurant joins Grubhub, it creates more selection for users to order food, and when more users start ordering more food, Grubhub becomes more attractive for restaurants to join so they can make more money from delivery orders.

(00:41:21):
The last network effect I focus on is data network effects. That's when the quality or cost of something improves as more data is collected through the product. When you say content to Pinterest, to a board, it gives Pinterest signal on the quality of that content, its relevance to other pieces of content, since they're shared to the same board, and more signal on your preferences. This allows Pinterest to better recommend more content to you as well as to other people who look like you and share similar interests.

(00:41:55):
One thing that's tricky about these network effects is most people talk about network effects in the context of social network, not marketplaces or SaaS like my background. The thing that's really tricky in understanding social networks is they're traditionally described as these direct network effect businesses, but all of them have to become either cross-side and/or data and network effect businesses over time. The only companies that stay direct network effect businesses are these pure communication tools like Messenger, iMessage, WhatsApp. There isn't a clear path to make money with those, but you want to sell ads, you're becoming a cross-side network effect business. Also, creators verse consumers creates a cross-side network effect business. If you want to get better at personalization, guess what? You're recommending content by leveraging data network effects.

Lenny (00:42:45):
I love that. You nailed it. I imagine marketplace founders listening to this may be wondering, "Hey, can I add on these additional network effects? Can I evolve towards one of these?" What you're saying is not only can you, you need to, eventually.

Casey Winters (00:42:58):
I agree. I think they're a great form of defensibility, first off. Do they make sense for every business? No, but in a lot of cases, in order for you to evolve properly and continue to grow, they can become a necessity.

Lenny (00:43:11):
Are there any other examples of marketplace companies that come to mind that did a great job evolving or adding one of these network effects or are just interesting?

Casey Winters (00:43:19):
Let's take some inventory. I think Zillow is really interesting in that a real estate listing site is not particularly an interesting product, but the ability of saying, very rarely do both sides of this network, people who are buying homes and selling homes need to connect, but I can find a way for the brand to connect with both of them by giving real time pricing information on the value of homes, and that creates a much stickier product for both sides. I think that was a pretty genuine innovation that other people have tried and rarely been as successful with. That's one that definitely sticks with me off the top of my head.

Lenny (00:44:04):
Great. We've been talking about Grubhub a lot. Grubhub had some pretty strong network effects, in large part, thanks to the work you did. One of the benefits of network effects is it creates a barrier to entry. It's hard to replicate and compete with a company where they already have all this network effect, but famously, Grubhub got disrupted by DoorDash and Uber Eats. Maybe you can talk about how that happened and why that happened. It'd be cool to hear just like, what do you think they could have done differently and what happened where their network effect got eaten for lunch? Pun intended.

Casey Winters (00:44:35):
Sure. It's a great question. I think people do mistake any form of network effect as this perfect form of defensibility. They're the best form of defensibility, but that doesn't mean they're immune to disruption. I think the main way this happens with cross-side network effects that we typically talk about for marketplaces is when a disruptor dramatically expands selection. I want to be clear, I left Grubhub at the end of 2013 before said lunch was eaten, so what I'm communicating is more like public knowledge of watching these amazing companies compete, rather than being inside the fire at the time.

Lenny (00:45:10):
Great. 

Casey Winters (00:45:11):
But one important thing to remember is Grubhub was an asset-light marketplace model. Restaurants did their own delivery through their own delivery drivers that they hired. I wrote this post for Andreessen Horowitz a few years ago about supply strategies and marketplaces, so in that you really need to be comprehensive or have exclusive inventory, and Grubhub strived to be comprehensive. We'd show every restaurant that delivered to you, even if we didn't work with them directly for online ordering. What happened about a year before I left Grubhub was that these competitors started to raise their seed rounds or series As to build delivery networks.

(00:45:51):
Postmates and DoorDash were the first two that rose to prominence. Uber Eats would come later, but they actually started with a pretty different business model, and this is an extremely different business. You're hiring drivers, you're managing logistics. We call this a heavily managed marketplace model, as you are now facilitating the transaction versus just connecting buyers and sellers and taking payments like Grubhub did. 

(00:46:18):
On the one hand, you have Grubhub, this extremely high-margin business, and these businesses coming up are actually negative-margin businesses. At least they were for a long time. In 2013, Grubhub acquired Seamless, its closest competitor at the time. Seamless still had a lead on Grubhub in New York, partially because it had this corporate program where law firms, and banks, and consultants got lunch stipends you had to redeem by ordering the food through Seamless. Grubhub operated in these dense cities and suburbs like in New York because those were really places that had restaurants that had delivery.

(00:46:58):
DoorDash, when it started, operated in less dense suburbs and worked with restaurants that had never done delivery before, and they would provide the delivery drivers themselves. This allowed DoorDash to grow without much competition in the early days. These companies also took some real gambles. One of the things they did is they delivered from restaurants they didn't have an agreement with, and that caused controversy and lawsuits. What it meant is when these companies did launch in the cities to go after Grubhub, it felt like DoorDash, and Postmates, and Uber had dramatically larger selection of restaurants to choose from, and Grubhub was definitely no longer near comprehensive. 

(00:47:40):
Back when we talked about cross-side network effects, the more selection of restaurants, the more attractive it is to users and vice-versa. At that point, Grubhub's put in a very peculiar position. It had gone public after raising $80 million in venture capital and raising a $100 million in an IPO, telling investors it's an extremely profitable, high-growth, asset-light marketplace, but now it's got disruption pressure from operationally intensive negative-margin delivery services that were raising $100 million every six months from the private markets.

(00:48:14):
What Grubhub assumed is that these businesses were just structurally unprofitable, and that VCs would stop subsidizing them eventually. Of course, that didn't happen. They kept raising more money. DoorDash eventually raised multiple billions of dollars in this market. Part of what they used that money for was to lock up agreements with national chains, which Grubhub never worked with. It was always like the local mom and pops, and promotions and discounts on the demand side. All of this is happening, and then the pandemic hits, and all of those negative margins turned positive for DoorDash for the first time, if I understand things correctly. 

(00:48:53):
On top of that, all this corporate ordering that we got from Seamless no longer mattered because no one goes to the office anymore, so this gambit really paid off and DoorDash just took the market. Grubhub then tried to copy the approaches of DoorDash and Postmates. They wrote this famous letter saying that they still thought the approaches were stupid, but their hand was forced, which is kind of funny to read in retrospect. A lot of armchair thinkers are like, "How could Grubhub have been so stupid to let DoorDash take the market that they built?" 

(00:49:24):
Look, I'll admit Grubhub made some mistakes, but I think it would have been extremely hard for Grubhub to come out on top here. Let's say in 2014 after you IPO, you do actually think what DoorDash, Postmates, and Uber are doing are smart. What do you do? Go to investors that you promised high growth and high profits and say you need to raise more money in debt to compete with negative-margin upstarts in a way that will destroy all that potential profit you mentioned? The stock would drop 90%. A lot of your employees would leave because their stock is now worthless. On top of that, building a delivery network is a heavy operations play that matches none of your core competencies, so to me, that feels like a death sentence.

(00:50:10):
I think the only play here was to buy DoorDash as early as possible, and let DoorDash and their operationally-heavy culture eat Grubhub from the inside out. I think Grubhub probably could have acquired them multiple times. For whatever reason, it never happened. It would have seemed pretty risky had Grubhub done that. Investors probably would have hated it, but it would have been their Netflix moment, where Netflix bet it all on streaming and they bet right. This is all incredibly easy to say in hindsight. 

(00:50:43):
I think what I've learned now that I'm more senior in my career is during existential threats, it's like when Nassim Taleb says, "The only rational reaction is overreaction." Unless you have a real viable reason to assume otherwise, you got to assume the disruptor is right and base your strategy on them playing an optimal game. Whereas, I think Grubhub assumed the disruptor was wrong and that it would all play out eventually in their favor, and it clearly didn't.

Lenny (00:51:14):
Wow. I have never heard that full story. That was amazing. Thank you for getting in so much detail there.

Casey Winters (00:51:19):
I don't know how much of it is right, but-

Lenny (00:51:22):
It seems right, from the outside. It's interesting that it's like a version of innovator's dilemma. Usually, innovator's dilemma is people come and do something cheaper at the low end of the market. In this case, it was more they were doing something that they didn't believe would scale. It was just much more inefficient-

Casey Winters (00:51:36):
Correct. 

Lenny (00:51:36):
... even though it was a better experience. Is that innovator's dilemma, or is that some other version of innovator's dilemma? Because to your point, they couldn't almost go after it.

Casey Winters (00:51:45):
I think it is in spirit, for sure.

Lenny (00:51:48):
The takeaway there that you've learned is don't underestimate someone that's trying to do something that's going to eat your lunch eventually, even though it feels like a terrible business model.

Casey Winters (00:52:00):
Right. If the market's rewarding it, the market will probably find a way to make it profitable. It's essentially, when everyone's find a more efficient network effect for demand on the marketplace side, you probably need to copy that as soon as possible, and if you can't copy it, own it, buy it. I think we've seen this a few times. Rover and Wag was another interesting example of this, where they found a more frequent use case that fit the same supply and demand, and Rover just copied it as soon as possible. That ended up working out for them in a way that it didn't as much for Grubhub.

Lenny (00:52:37):
I just did a talk recently on marketplace growth strategy, and someone asked me a really interesting question. "If you were trying to go up against a DoorDash or an Uber today, what would you do?" My answer is just like, money was so freely available at that point that they were able to ... A lot of this was spend. They had so much money raised. You said they were raising $100 million every six months. Is it even possible in today's climate, where you can't actually raise that much money, to have any sort of chance to beat a DoorDash or an Uber?

Casey Winters (00:53:05):
Yeah, clearly, they took advantage of the zero interest rate environments that we talked about earlier. That is not a replicable strategy in 2023. Any approach to compete with them has to be competing on a very different angle because, yeah, they can spend you into the dust. We'll see if anyone's able to build a way that creates new supply in market. I think you and I have seen a couple of earlier stage examples of that. We'll see if any of them scale, or something that feels cheaper or more fun on the demand side. That would be another way to potentially disrupt things. 

(00:53:40):
I think another thing that was working pretty well before the pandemic in building disrupters was focusing on the pickup use case, which DoorDash cannot do as easily. They've tried, but their whole value prop is the delivery network, which you don't need for pickup. Of course, the pandemic put a lot of those startups grinding to a halt as well. There's always angles, but you're going to need to be incredibly clever because just attacking with a war chest is not really going to work. 

Lenny (00:54:09):
Yeah. I noticed a lot of startups launching that are trying to do white label delivery for restaurants so they don't have to rely on DoorDash, but maybe that's a wedge to get in, and eventually they do the DoorDash sort of thing. 

Casey Winters (00:54:20):
Yeah, and I would say I'm pretty skeptical of those because they're just not really building the network effects on the demand side. They're just more like SaaS businesses. I think those struggle to be multi-$100 million in revenue businesses because the take rate is typically like a third or a fourth of what a DoorDash can charge.

Lenny (00:54:39):
Perfect segue to my next question, and I only have a couple more. There's this concept and I think pull from marketplace founders to add a SaaS tool, eventually, and have both business models. Then there's often the reverse, where a SaaS company wants to add a marketplace. I know this question is something you get a lot, and so just a question for you. Does this work? Are there examples where they've added this additional way of making money? Which direction do you find is most often successful and not successful? 

Casey Winters (00:55:11):
The canonical example that a lot of these founders use is OpenTable. That always felt really unfulfilling to me because it's very old at this point. Probably the younger people listening to the podcast are like, "What's OpenTable?" I think that business has incredibly underperformed the market it operated in. It had a good exit. It sold for $2.6 billion, I think, to Booking.com, but Booking subsequently wrote that value down below a billion, so that's not really the outcome I think we're looking for, traditionally, in marketplaces.

Lenny (00:55:43):
Maybe explain what it was initially, the SaaS tool versus a financial marketplace. 

Casey Winters (00:55:47):
Oh, sure. OpenTable promised both a SaaS tool that would help you understand what tables are open and where to seat people, so for the host in the front of the house in a restaurant, but also bring in additional reservations to fill up your restaurant. Because I think what people misunderstand about restaurants is they're, "Oh, these restaurants are these incredibly low-margin businesses." It's like, yeah, they are because they're paying the rent no matter what. 

(00:56:14):
Once you're already paying the rent no matter what happens, you're incentivized to pump as much food out the kitchen and to get as many people seated in-house as possible. People would say like, "Oh, Grubhub and DoorDash are charging too much." It's like, no, delivery orders and catering orders are basically pure margin to restaurants. The chefs are already there. The rent is already being paid. "The more things we pump out of the kitchen, the more money we make," which is why restaurants are willing to pay higher fees. These restaurants are not stupid. They're not being misinformed. OpenTable, well before there were any delivery startups, was like, "We're going to fill up your tables, and we're going to give you software that helps you manage your tables most effectively to make the most profit." 

Lenny (00:57:01):
Got it. Okay, great. If you've got-

Casey Winters (00:57:05):
That's OpenTable. Look, this is definitely the strategy we are working on with Eventbrite, where we started with something that was more SaaS-like, enabling easy payments and certain tools to make event creators' business more efficient, and we're layering in more of the traditional marketplace value prop of demand, driving more ticket sales for these event creators. I would say it's got a ways to go to be working really well. 

(00:57:29):
What does working really well look like? It's when the marketplace model unlocks those cross-side network effects that make it easier to grow. Event creators, when Eventbrite started, they would just go do their own marketing to bring people to Eventbrite to transact on their events that they had listed there. Now Eventbrite drives 25% of the ticket sales itself, and that percentage is growing faster than-

Lenny (00:57:52):
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

Casey Winters (00:57:52):
Yeah. It's growing faster than the rest of the business, which is great, but it probably needs to be closer to 50% to unlock those really cross-side network effects. That would mean that creators start selecting Eventbrite because of all the demand Eventbrite has versus the quality of the SaaS tools. That's obviously something we're working on. Faire is a company I advised more recently that I think has unlocked this model in the reverse, where Faire is a wholesale marketplace between independent retailers and brands so that you could sell products at these retailers, like a boutique in your local neighborhood. 

(00:58:29):
Faire built the marketplace first, and then it later built a SaaS tool that allowed the brands to onboard their current retailers into the platform and get better terms on payments and free returns. It didn't charge anything to use the SaaS tool for any rebookings that happened through that platform. What that did is it onboarded more independent retailers that they could cross-sell to other brands without needing to use a sales team. When they cross-sold, of course, Faire did take their percentage on those transactions. I think that model's worked out really well, and Faire has grown quite quickly. 

Lenny (00:59:06):
The examples you gave, Eventbrite was a SaaS tool trying to add a marketplace. 

Casey Winters (00:59:10):
Yep. 

Lenny (00:59:10):
Faire is an example of a marketplace adding a SaaS tool. Is the takeaway there that it's, in your experience, it's generally more ... You're going to have a better time if you're a marketplace adding a SaaS tool versus the other way around? 

Casey Winters (00:59:24):
Yeah. I think that's right. I think, I don't know when it was. Just maybe like 2015 or whatever. A bunch of investors started writing about SaaS to marketplace transitions, and that's the transition Eventbrite's going through. It's going to work, but it's hard. It's not replicable for a lot of other SaaS businesses. You need to have a direct relationship with your customers' customers, first off. Those customers need to have needs beyond that single supplier.

(00:59:50):
Usually, it's like a discovery value prop for other suppliers, and you need to build this totally new skill set to build tools for your customer's customer, who is very different from your current customer. Whereas, marketplace is that added SaaS component. It's a customer acquisition tool like Faire, or a workflow, or a retention tool to increase retention or reduce disintermediation. I think you'll see that be a lot more common approach and much more replicable. 

Lenny (01:00:20):
Is this just rooted in the fact that marketplaces are incredibly hard, no matter whether you start with them or whether you add them? Is that the root of the issue here?

Casey Winters (01:00:28):
I think that's a good way to frame it. If you're building a startup in 2023 and you're like, "Oh, I'm going to build a SaaS business, and then five years later, I'm going to build this marketplace business on top of that," it's kind of like it's going to take a long time for you to de-risk the hardest part of that strategy. Whereas, if you get the hard part done upfront, it opens up a lot of amazing adjacencies, different ways to grow. I think there's definitely truth in that statement. 

Lenny (01:00:54):
The takeaway here is that if you're trying to add a marketplace, it's going to be very hard. You shared a couple things, a couple attributes that tell you that maybe it might work. Maybe just share those again real quick.

Casey Winters (01:01:07):
Take Square, or Substack, or Patreon, or Eventbrite. All of these are examples of SaaS businesses that in providing a SaaS service, deal with the customer and the customer's customer. That makes it a lot easier because you already have a relationship. They already know your brand, whereas, Stripe, we buy things. We don't know if we're buying it through Stripe. It's just a SaaS tool that's white labeled on the backend. We have no idea. I think that's the first element. There's a lot of businesses that look like that, but it is a subset of SaaS businesses that look like that.

(01:01:38):
Then secondly, those customers that you're building a relationship with, they need to have a reason to transact with more than one of your current customers on the supply side, so if you're always going to use that same supplier, there's no need for me to show you the rest of the inventory.

(01:01:57):
Basically, all marketplaces win on, like we mentioned, selection and you needing selection. Then there's, of course, the marketplaces that win with standardization of like, I can get it at any time. It might be from different people, but I know that Uber car is going to be there in five minutes, or whatever. I don't care as much who the driver is. One of those has to be there. You just find in a lot of these examples, there isn't really that much of a discovery need for who the demand side would be in this theoretical marketplace when you dig into it. 

Lenny (01:02:31):
It might be helpful just to define what makes it a marketplace. In my eyes, it's you're driving demand through supply. That's like the nuance, right? Because otherwise, you're just a tool that they're using to do something they want to do. 

Casey Winters (01:02:42):
Yeah. Exactly, right. It's like the primary value prop of why supply signs up is that you're going to bring them extra business. If you have customer, buyers and sellers, but the primary reason supply signs up is for tooling or payments like how Eventbrite started, that's not really a marketplace. I call it a SaaS-like network. Some people might just call it a SaaS business, a payments business, whatever the case may be, but it doesn't really have those cross-side network effects that we associate with marketplaces.

Lenny (01:03:10):
What this makes me think about is Patreon and Substack. Interestingly, when I was looking at early Patreon days, what I understand is they wanted to be a marketplace. They wanted to be a place where artists come. They collect payment, and then people can discover artists to patronize. What they found is nobody needed ... That wasn't a problem anyone had. 

Casey Winters (01:03:29):
Exactly, exactly. 

Lenny (01:03:30):
I'm not looking for- [inaudible 01:03:31]

Casey Winters (01:03:30):
I'm not looking for other people to donate money to. Same with GoFundMe, right?

Lenny (01:03:33):
With that story in mind, when I was chatting with the Substack people early on, it was like this is exactly what you're going to run into. No one's sitting around looking for more newsletters to subscribe to, but shockingly, they've actually pulled it off. 

Casey Winters (01:03:47):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:03:47):
They have a really wild network effect going now and marketplace. 

Casey Winters (01:03:50):
I've been very impressed with what they've built. I don't know if I'd call it a marketplace yet, but I think they were able to abstract a way, the version of what you just said to something that was actually useful, which is, yes, I don't want more emails to subscribe to, but I do ... I am fundamentally interested in more articles relevant to my interests. No one has really solved that super well. 

(01:04:15):
Twitter was a very hacky form of that, where I follow you and then I see you when you post a new blog because you tell everyone on Twitter you posted a new blog, but it isn't built for that. Whereas the Substack reader will now allow me to be like, "Ah, yeah. Sure, I'll subscribe," so I really like what they've done. It'll be interesting to see how big a business that is and how it all plays out. I think their execution has been really solid. 

Lenny (01:04:39):
Awesome. I feel the same way. I also wasn't sure whether it makes ... it's worth calling a marketplace, but for whatever it's worth, 80% of my new signups are coming from Substack's network, the recommendations feature and their onboarding, things like that. Like-

Casey Winters (01:04:52):
Do you think that's unique to you because you're already a top one percenter Substacker? Or is that a meaningful number for new-ish players? If I finally switch my email list to Substack, which has been on my list for a long time, that probably won't be the same percentage for me, right? 

Lenny (01:05:11):
Absolutely not. Yeah, no, I think there's definitely, if you're there first and people know of you, more people will recommend you. I think, over time, more and more people start to recommend you. I think they released a stat that something like 40% of their new users are coming from a recommendation, or new signups or something like that. It's pretty widely happening, but I don't know how much-

Casey Winters (01:05:31):
That's excellent. 

Lenny (01:05:32):
... of that is just the top 10, so it's pretty incredible. It was a really innovative feature and good job, Substack. We had a product on this podcast talking about that exact feature for a whole hour, if you're interested. 

Casey Winters (01:05:43):
Awesome. 

Lenny (01:05:43):
Okay. Final question, and then we have our very exciting lightening round. This is around consumer companies and consumer subscription companies. I know you work with a lot of founders that are building consumer subscription companies, and just consumer startups in general. 

Casey Winters (01:05:57):
Yep.

Lenny (01:05:58):
You often tell me how they're incredibly hard to build into thriving businesses. Can you just talk about why consumer subscription startups are so hard and products are so hard? 

Casey Winters (01:06:07):
I feel like we're making this quite a downer podcast, Lenny, but-

Lenny (01:06:10):
This is, people need to hear the truth. There's a lot of happy talk out there, and a lot of posts, "Here's how you do this."

Casey Winters (01:06:16):
Sure. 

Lenny (01:06:17):
Sometimes, you can't.

Casey Winters (01:06:18):
I think in order to understand these businesses, you have to start with, why do investors like B2B SaaS? Why do they like B2B subscription? I think the way most people respond to that question, they say like, "Oh, predictable revenue, right?" It's like, ah, sure. That's cool and all, but I think that's actually not the most important. I'd argue there's two great attributes of B2B SaaS. One is that businesses are more predictable in how well they're routine. They're rational. You can understand who are good versus bad businesses for your product, as well as which ones are going to grow versus go out of business. 

(01:06:53):
More importantly, the second thing that's great about B2B SaaS is net dollar retention. What is net dollar retention if you don't work at SaaS? Well, as a SaaS company, some of your customers are going to churn. Some of your customers are going to stay. Normally, normally outside of potentially current macroeconomic conditions with all the layoffs, when customers do stick around, they tend to spend more. Either they buy more seats if you're a seat-based model, or they use the product more if you're a usage model. The SaaS company just makes more money in year two, year three, et cetera. 

(01:07:27):
Consumer subscription just doesn't have any of these benefits. Consumers are way less predictable. They tend to retain worse than businesses, and they also don't have net dollar retention characteristics. If the user retains paying you in year two, you probably making the same amount that you made from them in year one, not more. What that means is you need higher user-based retention than B2B SaaS businesses with more unpredictable users, and it's a lot higher than, I think, founders tend to think. We're talking annual retention that needs to be north of 60, perhaps even 70%.

(01:08:04):
You look at who's actually been able to do that at scale, and it's a really small list. Netflix in the U.S., Amazon Prime, Spotify, Duolingo, I think, is emerging as one of these players that's making it work. When you look at how they do it, they're either doing it with massive OPEX and economies of scale, or through a network effect, or some other bespoke growth loop that's not that easy to replicate. Duolingo has a strong data network effect. The lessons get better the more people use it. Beek, the company I'm on the board of has a cross-side network effect between creators who create the content and the listeners, and the creators bring a lot of distribution from their existing social networks to bring new people in the app to listen. Netflix and Amazon, they spend billions of dollars on content. 

(01:08:58):
I think the default path of like, "I'm going to spend money on paid acquisition. I'm going to retain half of my audience year-over-year." That's just a path to go on eventually. I think what's interesting about these businesses is you can model it so you can learn when it's going to happen. You can learn when the retention dips, and when you can no longer profitably acquire users. If you want to look at a model in real time, just look at Blue Apron. The company raised $300 million in an IPO that valued it at $2 billion. It's worth $50 million today on the New York Stock Exchange. 

(01:09:35):
I think people understand now, if they didn't before, that paid acquisition tends to get worse as you scale. You target the best customers first. They have great conversion, great retention, and then as you expand your targeting of new customers, every one of those metrics gets worse until it's no longer profitable. Maybe two years from now, it may be be five years from now, but eventually, it'll be no longer profitable. What network effects allow you to do is they allow your product to get better faster than the customers you target get worse, normally, through increased selection, like some of the examples we gave with DoorDash and others.

Lenny (01:10:11):
This is such a cool topic. I actually have a post about this that I recalled now as you're talking about it. Just to double-click on the retention point and it's like, freaks you out when you really get into it. That say your retention is like 70% cohort retention for a year. I forget the math, but every three or four years, you basically have to rebuild your entire user base because it just, it keeps trickling out, so your growth just has to continue-

Casey Winters (01:10:34):
It's mind-boggling. You run out of humans. Yeah, it's really hard. If you can retain people incredibly well, meaning those people just never churn, yeah, you've got a great business, but look at the effort the companies that have done that are doing to do that. Spotify doesn't make profit. Netflix, Amazon just spend so much money to try to do that. How replicable is that for a startup? I'd rather say like, "Let's try and get some network effects involved here. Let's get our customer acquisition cost to zero. Let's think about other ways to monetize because this alone feels like [inaudible 01:11:07]." 

Lenny (01:11:08):
This is also why a lot of these companies pivot to B2B. They realize they're not going to get anywhere with B2C. The other lesson I took away ... Because I interviewed a lot of these early B2C subscription app founders and employees, and I think about companies like Grammarly, Duolingo, Noom. Forget. There are a few more. One of the other trends across them all is they're all very efficient and very small for a long time because they needed time to figure out how to make anything work and then just continue to stay small and super scrappy.

Casey Winters (01:11:37):
I think that's a great point. It was an interesting case study between Calm and Headspace. Because Calm remained like 10 people forever.

Lenny (01:11:44):
Wow. 

Casey Winters (01:11:45):
Headspace had gone into like hundreds of people. Calm basically never lost money, and that allowed them to pivot easier during massive changes, like app tracking transparency threw a wrench into all paid acquisition. If you're not losing money, cool. You have time to figure out how to grow again, but if that increases your burn by like $100 million, you have a lot more of a panic on your hands. 

Lenny (01:12:12):
Maybe just to tie the loop, tie the knot, close the thread on this topic, if you're a B2C subscription founder, what would be some takeaways that you would want to put in their head to think about how to maybe survive? 

Casey Winters (01:12:26):
Yeah, so if what your plan is is to use paid acquisition on top of a freemium model to get a percentage of people to convert, and hopefully, stick around forever, I'd pivot right now. It's like, I just cannot see it working. How do you pivot? Well, how do you make it social so that people are bringing in other people? How do you get a supply side to the content, or education, or whatever you're building and make it in the supply side's interest to refer people?

(01:12:55):
You have to do something that's either building some more organic growth loops into the business, or building network effects into the business, or else we could go spend two hours and model out exactly when you're going to run out of money. It's just that predictable. A lot of founders don't like to hear it when I tell them that, but I'd rather them hear it now than learn it three years from now.

Lenny (01:13:15):
Well, we've reached our very exciting lightening round. I'm just going to dive right in. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people? 

Casey Winters (01:13:23):
Definitely The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt, which explains how my brain works, pretty well. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Danny Kahneman. I took a lot of the behavioral economics classes in my MBA program, and then his book came out the year after, so I just absorbed it as quick as possible. 

Lenny (01:13:48):
Was he your professor, or that was just the topic?

Casey Winters (01:13:51):
Some of his pupils were professors of mine, yeah. 

Lenny (01:13:54):
Amazing. Very cool.

Casey Winters (01:13:57):
Then the third is a book called Profit from the Core by Chris Zook.

Lenny (01:14:02):
Amazing. That's a new one. I love when there's new books being added to the collection. 

Casey Winters (01:14:05):
There you go.

Lenny (01:14:06):
Okay. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Casey Winters (01:14:11):
Well, Party Down just came back and that's like-

Lenny (01:14:14):
I've been watching that.

Casey Winters (01:14:15):
That's one of my favorite-

Lenny (01:14:16):
I'd never heard of it. 

Casey Winters (01:14:16):
It's one of my favorite comedies of all time. Yeah, go back-

Lenny (01:14:18):
Cool.

Casey Winters (01:14:19):
Go back and watch the first couple seasons if you haven't. 

Lenny (01:14:20):
That's what I've been doing. That's what I've been doing. 

Casey Winters (01:14:21):
Okay. Great, great. Other things like The Last of Us is great. I really enjoyed the video games. Severance is great. Station Eleven is great. I loved the book too, but I thought that was really good. Movies, there haven't really been a lot of great movies lately, but I did rewatch Kicking and Screaming from the '90s. I think it really holds up well. I don't know how many of you have heard it, but it's about a group of college kids who graduate, but they just decide not to leave campus and start their lives, and they just stick around campus. I really enjoyed that one.  

Lenny (01:14:58):
Amazing. We have a drinking game any time someone mentions Last of Us, so if you're driving to work listening to your podcast on your commute, take some coffee or whatever you got. 

(01:15:09):
Two more questions. What's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process, or maybe that you've recommended people change that has had a tremendous impact on people's ability to execute?

Casey Winters (01:15:21):
I preach cross-functional teams and alignment pretty aggressively, so how to get people from all the different functions aligned on the same OKRs and working together. I used to say like, "Look, if someone in that cross-functional team is pulling rank, it means something's fucked up on the team." 

(01:15:39):
Something we started doing more recently at both Eventbrite and Whatnot is just designating the person on the cross-functional team who drives the project. At Eventbrite, we call it the driver. At Whatnot, we call it the DRI, directly responsible individual. Once that person makes the call, it's disagree and commit time. There's no escalation path. If you're not the DRI and you're on the team and they made the call, all right. It's time to sign up and go forward on that decision. If they made the wrong decision later, okay, we'll learn once we ship.

Lenny (01:16:11):
Final question. Something I love that you do in your own newsletter and blog is you share what you're listening to. What are you listening to these days?

Casey Winters (01:16:19):
Sure. Kelela recently came out with her second album, Raven, which is really great. I've been listening to that. Orbital came out with a new album called Optimal Delusion that's been pretty good. Then an oldie but goodie is De La Soul's music finally came out on Spotify, and the Stakes Is High is one of my favorite hip hop albums ever, so I've been jamming to that. 

Lenny (01:16:45):
Amazing. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Casey Winters (01:16:50):
I blog not near as frequently as you at caseyaccidental.com. You can find me on Twitter @onecaseman. Yeah, just pay it forward. Help your companies build better products and better businesses. That's all I care about.

Lenny (01:17:06):
Casey, thank you so much for being here. I feel like we're building some kind of network effect, you and I, doing these podcasts. Hopefully, you'll be back for a third time someday. Thank you again. Really appreciate it. 

Casey Winters (01:17:15):
Yeah. Thanks for having me. Hopefully, they don't get sick of me by then. 

Lenny (01:17:17):
Bye, everyone.

# An operator’s guide to product strategy | Chandra Janakiraman (CPO at VRChat, ex-Meta, Headspace)

## Transcript

Chandra Janakiraman (00:00:00):
I started noticing that there was a certain mystique and aura about product strategy. There was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. It was almost as if there was a strategy gene you needed to be born with to be good at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
Say someone's sitting down, okay, I'm going to start developing a strategy for our product. Where do you begin? What does this process look like?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:00:23):
In terms of what product strategy is? There is a smallest flavor of it which focuses on solving problems, they're called present forward, and it typically operates in a two-year horizon. We use a five-stage process to get there and it takes about eight to 12 weeks. The reason I think this process works is there is a ton of alignment built in. It goes back to human psychology of just something that comes from you, feels a lot more familiar and easy to accept.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Let's talk about big S strategy. When should you approach strategy this way?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:00:53):
There's this interesting quote by Elon Musk, which is-

Elon Musk (00:00:56):
"Life's got to be about more than just solving problems."

Chandra Janakiraman (00:00:58):
I think this is true of every sort of company. There needs to be an aspirational and cool component to strategy. What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
Today my guest is Chandra Janakiraman. Chandra is chief product officer and executive vice president at VRChat. He was a product leader at Meta, chief product officer at Headspace, a GM at Zynga, and a senior PM at Amazon. And the way this podcast episode happened was an avid podcast listener, Karthik Suresh, told me about Chandra at a community meetup. And when I connected with Chandra, it was clear that I needed to get him on the podcast.

(00:01:40):
Chandra is a student of strategy and has spent his career developing what he calls an operator's guide to strategy, which essentially pulls together the best ideas from Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, Playing to Win, Michael Porter and others to create a very clear, reliable and easy-to-follow five-step process to develop a great strategy and a set of next steps for your product and company. After hearing Chandra walk through this in our conversation, I'm basically going to now point everyone who wants to get better at strategy to this episode and Chandra's method. Strategy is at the heart of every great product and team and business, and it's also the source of so much pain if you do it badly. This episode is meant to help you avoid that. A big thank you to Karthik for making this connection. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Chandra Janakiraman.

(00:02:39):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation A-B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams, companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.

(00:03:09):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments, easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more With advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A-B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10 x your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.

(00:03:57):
This episode is brought to you by Airtable ProductCentral, the unified system that brings your entire product org together in one place. No more scattered tools, no more misaligned teams. If you're like most product leaders, you're tired of constant context switching between tools. That's why Airtable built Product Central after decades of working with world-class product companies. Think of it as mission control for your entire product organization. Unlike rigid point solutions, product central powers everything from resourcing to voice of customer to roadmapping to launch execution. And because it's built on Airtable's no-code platform, you can customize every workflow to match exactly how your team works. No limitations, no compromises.

(00:04:51):
Chandra, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:04:55):
Pleasure to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
I want to share actually the context and how this conversation happened. I was at a meetup of my readership, of my community and someone came up to me and they're like, "Lenny, you need to get this guy Chandra on your podcast. He's the most amazing playbook for developing a strategy." He's gone through it with you at a company he worked at with you once, and he's just like, "People need to learn this because it's so good." And to me, if someone can get better at strategy, it feels like it just makes so much of the way the company operates and the way that people work better. So we chatted, we met, I was like, "I completely agree. We definitely need to get you on this podcast to share your approach to the strategy." So we made this happen, and so we're here. So again, thank you for doing this and sharing.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:05:37):
Thank you. Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:39):
First of all, I wanted to ask just you're very passionate about strategy and developing a way to consistently create great strategies. What got you so interested in this stuff in the first place? What kind of sparked your interest in this area?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:05:53):
Yeah, yeah, it's a very interesting story. It goes back all the way 10 years ago, but I remember it vividly like it happened yesterday. And I was a relatively new VP of product at Headspace, and we had this amazing company vision and mission that the founders had laid out, and I had come in and established goals for the team in terms of our key metrics, and we had a very buttoned up roadmap in my mind that fed into that company mission and vision. And I was feeling pretty good about how things were shaping up.

(00:06:37):
And on a particular Monday, the founder, CEO pulled me aside, and in his usual disarming style, he sort of made a short but profound statement. He said that, "Hey, CJ, I'm hearing that a lot of people don't really understand why we are working on what we are working on," and that was it. That was really the extent of what he shared. And it was a little bit of a bubble bursting moment for me because we obviously had spent a lot of time building the plan and I was feeling relatively good about the plan.

(00:07:21):
And so I spoke to a few people. I sort of wanted to understand it a little bit deeper, like, "Hey, what's happening?" And he was right. He was right. A lot of people didn't really understand why we were working on the things we were working on, and it led to some soul-searching. And basically I was lucky because there was actually a board member of Headspace who had a product background, kind of knew what good looked like, and I came to the conclusion, "Hey, we needed a strategy for Headspace."

(00:07:56):
So with extensive work with her, with the board person, we built the first written product strategy for Headspace. And that, and the subsequent actions on the product led to a complete re-imagination of the product. And basically we were able to create a new product, we call it the Next Generation Headspace, which on one hand it could support a comprehensive library of content, not just meditation, but non-meditation content as well. It had the sort of home experience where everything was incredibly personalized for the individuals, and there were several motivational elements built into the whole product experience. And it was very transformational for the company and the product because it changed the product from being a meditation app to a broader health and wellness service and really put the company on a different trajectory. It led to my promotion to the first CPO at Headspace.

(00:09:07):
And most interestingly, I had a chance to, while going through it almost in a sort of out of body way, observed the process of like, okay, how did we put this thing together? And what actually went into it? What really started as almost a personal crisis moment of finding this need to create a strategy for a product and a company led to a bigger sort of quest for me, which is I started noticing that there was a certain mystique and aura about product strategy, and there was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. And it was almost as if there was a strategy gene that you needed to be born with to be good at it. And that bothered me a lot, and I sort of wanted to ask myself, is it possible to break that divide between the haves and the have-nots and make this capability widely accessible through a procedural approach. And I have news for you. The answer is yes, anybody can build product strategy through a clear understanding of what it is and through a friendly and repeatable playbook.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:29):
Amazing. That's exactly what I want to do here. The point you made about the why, I think everyone listening to this that's been in product for long enough has heard that of just, "Your team doesn't understand why we're doing this." I've heard that a number of times, as much as you think you're killing it, there's always that, you forget sometimes to do that or you aren't doing it great. And I love that basically the solution to that is the strategy solves that problem of helping people connect the dots and understand why this is the roadmap, why this is the strategy. Okay, so before we get into it, just one more context question, what's just the best way to think about what you're about to share and also who's it for? Who needs to hear this briefly?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:11:11):
So the way to think about this, the substance is that this is not a new framework or theory that I'm going to be talking about. There are plenty of excellent materials on strategy from ancient texts like The Art of War from Sun Tzu, all of Michael Porter's work, Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt, who's been on your podcast, Playing to Win Lafley and Roger Martin. So there's a ton of extensively researched and well-founded materials out there. So the way I would think about this is, it's more of an operator's interpretation of all the stuff that's out there and are able to package it into something that's friendly and repeatable, particularly for product people who think they are weak at strategy or perhaps have received such feedback.

(00:12:05):
And just in terms of the battle-tested nature of it, I personally use this playbook about five to six times tweaking and optimizing it each time based on what I thought worked, what people thought worked and didn't work, including several times at Meta and usually leading to strong results, both for me achieving senior leadership alignment as well as driving business results for the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:36):
Okay, I'm getting more and more excited. Let's get into it, let's get into this playbook. People hear this word strategy a lot. They're told be more strategic, build a better strategy. What's the simplest way to understand what is a strategy?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:12:49):
Yeah, let's start with some basic definitions, which is as you asked, what is product strategy? And if you think back to the Headspace example, this sort of comes to life as well. So product strategy, strategy sits between the mission and vision and the plan. It could be at the company level or at the team level, but it's usually sitting between the mission and vision and the plan. And the plan, you can call the plan the roadmap, which is basically an ordered list of things that you want to get done and the mission and vision is basically sort of the purpose of existence, what does it look like when you achieve your purpose of existence? So it sits between the two and it forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact.

(00:13:40):
And I want to borrow an analogy from the world of physics. There is this concept called resonance, and the concept of resonance is really interesting, and it's actually very close to the concept of strategy. So the concept of resonance works as follows, when you apply a certain frequency to an object and you get pretty close to its natural frequency, you see a disproportionate increase in the amplitude of how that object vibrates. And so it's very interesting, if you apply any other frequency, there's very little effect on the object, but if you get close to its natural frequency, there's this exponential increase in the vibration of the product. So this concept of resonance is interesting.

(00:14:27):
So the way to think about it in the context of strategy is, it is selecting that frequency to achieve resonance between the product and the market. And so when you get close to that frequency, you should see tremendous impact in terms of the product landing well in the market. And so that's how I would think about it. It sits between mission, vision and the plan. It forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact, so using resonance as a sort of an example, and it ideally includes three components. The first is a handful of areas to focus on and I call these strategic pillars and then a whole bunch of areas that are explicitly not the focus. And the third component is why. So why are the focus areas, A, B and C? Why are these whole bunch of areas not the focus? And that's the three components. That's really it in terms of product strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:32):
I love it. And I love the things we aren't doing as a core part of this, that comes up a lot on this podcast of being clear is what we're not going to do. We know these could be things we could do, but we're deciding we're not doing these things.

(00:15:42):
Okay, so let's just talk through how you go about developing a strategy using this method. Say someone's sitting down, "Okay, I'm going to start developing a strategy for our product." Where do you begin? What does this process look like? Let's start talking through it.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:15:59):
So I sort of want to first explain this concept called smallest strategy, and I'll sort of talk about what that is and how it's different from another kind. But the basic sort of strategic process I would say takes about eight to 12 weeks long. It's something that I think people often underestimate how long it takes and eventually end up taking a lot more time. But when they start off, they think, "Oh, I could probably stand this up in a couple of weeks," but usually through iteration it actually ends up taking 8 to 12 weeks anyway. So it's good to start with setting clear expectations that it takes about eight to 12 weeks. And the way to justify the ROI on that is typically a strategy like this can be leveraged for about a couple of years. So relative to that sort of payback period, I think the investment is relatively small. So it's pretty healthy from that sense to manage expectations and say that that's how long it's going to take.

(00:17:00):
So within that period, there are five phases. There's the preparation phase, there's a strategy sprint, the design sprint, the document writing and the rollout. And those are the five phases, which I'll explain how one would go through. And basically each of them has a certain sort of time recommendation. For example, the preparation phase I would say is probably about four weeks. The strategy sprint is up to about one week. The design sprint is another one week, document writing maybe one to two weeks, and the rollout is maybe two to three weeks. So that's how you get to that range of eight to 12 weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:40):
Essentially it's like a quarter of work to get to a final great strategy. And of these five phases, the biggest bucket is preparation, which to me sounds like it's not like a full-time team thing. It's starting to gather data and user research-

Chandra Janakiraman (00:17:56):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:57):
As you talk through this, I'm curious just how much of the team is involved in each of these steps. But I think it's an important point, if you want a really good winning strategy, you need to give a time. You can't just say, "In a month or a week, we need to develop a strategy, go figure it out, write this document." Great. Cool. So let's talk about step one preparation.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:18:14):
That's correct, Lenny. And I think you, if I forget, remind me that sometimes there is pressure. There's just business pressure, like the CEO might still want a strategy in two weeks, how do you respond to that? And I think we can find some clever shortcuts there, but I think to the extent possible, the leader should push for [inaudible 00:18:39] to make something really great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:40):
And I think part of it is that as a leader, you can start on this before... you know this is coming, so you should get started before it's even asked for.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:18:48):
That's correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):
Yeah, awesome. Okay, let's get into it.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:18:51):
So I think you sort of touched on this in terms of the preparation phase being the longest phase, but also not being sort of like a full-time thing. So that's absolutely right. So the preparation phase is really... The way to start this, which is a little different from other approaches I've seen from people is to actually form a strategy working group. This is an important concept. So the strategy working group is sort of a small team. It typically consists of engineering, product design and data at a minimum. And in certain cases, there's a luxury to have other functions like product marketing, user research, that's also part of the strategy working group. But the minimum quorum, I would recommend is engineering, product design and data because design in some ways represents both sort of product design and user research. So you do get the voice of the user from that perspective. And typically the PM is driving the strategy working group and the process, but that working group is actually the team that's going to collaboratively create the strategy doc.

(00:19:59):
And so in the preparation phase, there's usually a kickoff meeting where the PM pulls the team together, talks about the purpose of the process, lays out the different phases, and gives everybody a feel for what's going to happen in the next 8 to 12 weeks. And basically then creates a list of very discrete action items and deliverables for each of the stakeholders in the working group. So specifically, there's an action item around aggregating all the behavioral insights that the team might have around the product. And usually this is a combination of previous analysis that the team has run on the data side and potentially also feature launches and how they have done. So all kind of analytical analysis.

(00:20:50):
The ask is really to create a meta analysis of all of the analysis. So the data person on the strategy working group has to scan the historical archives at the company and sort of synthesize and condense that into a very sort of digestible macro themes and learnings about users. So that's sort of one preparation phase item.

(00:21:16):
The second is UXR insight. So again, there's probably a lot of soft hard signals about users, not just based on research that's run by user researchers, but also potentially from the customer service team, social channels, and basically a meta analysis of all of that into one very actionable and synthesized deck on all the insights on users. That's usually led by the design person and with support from their research team. And that's sort of the second action item.

(00:21:53):
The third action item is leadership interviews. So I sort of have this fun story of the fruit with leadership strategy reviews, which I want to share. So imagine, this is sort of how sometimes strategy reviews go, which is you bring a fruit to the reviewer and say, "Hey, here's a mango, what do you think?" And the reviewer says, "I actually don't like mangoes." And you're like, "Oh," you're sort of sad. You take it back, you bring an apple and you show, "Hey, what do you think of an apple?" And then the leader says, "I actually stopped eating apples last year." And so you're disappointed again. You go back, you bring a banana. "I hated bananas since I was a kid." And so it's a bit of a silly caricature of reviews, but there's a bit of grain of truth there, which is, imagine how frustrating that is for both the reviewer and the person who's reviewing.

(00:22:54):
And so it could be made so much better if you just engage with your leaders before you actually build a strategy. It's amazing how few people actually do that. And so the fruit story tells you, hey, imagine if you just asked the reviewer, "Do you even like fruits?" How much better the experience would've been for both parties. And so leadership interviews are a very important part of a strategy formulation process. So you can divide and conquer, there's several leaders, like you assign different leaders to different people on the strategy working group and each of them sort talks to that leader. And there are a few questions that I would recommend asking, and it's basically, what does success feel like for the leader? What does failure look like? What is the measure of success? What are principles to keep in mind while going through this process?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:51):
And these are centered around the product that you're working on?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:23:55):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:55):
For Headspace, it'd be like, what do you think success looks like for Headspace or the specific feature of Headspace? [inaudible 00:24:03].

Chandra Janakiraman (00:24:02):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):
Okay, cool.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:24:04):
That's right, yeah. And also I think ask them for their favorite or better ideas. It's actually what I've found through this process is a lot of leaders have these better ideas, they just feel shy to share it because they don't want their teams to think of them as micromanage-y. They want their teams to figure out the answer themselves, but then when you ask them, they actually have a pet idea always.

(00:24:29):
And so asking them just takes the mystery out of it. And it also gives them a creative avenue. So some people feel nervous about engaging senior leaders in these conversations in the sense that, hey, is it a waste of their time? What I've found is the exact opposite, senior leaders are, they welcome this because one, it's actually a more fun conversation for them than the other meetings that they have in their day because they're getting a little bit of their creative juices going, and they actually feel happy that somebody actually asked them what they're feeling and thinking about. And so it's actually very, very positive energy when you ask leaders just what they want. And it's also not a sign of weakness. It's actually a sign of strength and humility to ask your leaders what you want. And so keeping that fruit story in mind, I want to just say that this is a very, very positive thing, a very powerful thing.

(00:25:26):
The next area is competitive analysis. So if there is a product marketing person, they can do it for you. If there isn't, the PM should do it themselves. And basically the idea is you try to understand who are the comparables or the competitors in the space, and you sort of build a little bit of a head-to-head and sort a stack chart of where's everybody going and what are of the angles of investment for different people based on the explicit signals, which is what are they releasing?

(00:25:59):
You don't really know what their strategies are, but you can kind of tell when you look at the features they're putting out that, oh, they seem to be focusing on this particular area. And so that's sort of competitive analysis. And bigger companies, there's also another important input, which is adjacent roadmaps. Are the teams adjacent to you and what are they investing in? Because oftentimes that can have a rub-off effect on your team, and if you're not aligning with other key teams, it's going to be important. So adjacent roadmaps and a summary of that.

(00:26:33):
And last but not least, is what I call user observation. So I like the strategy working group to actually either interview a user or watch a video and report key learnings. And the idea is not to action those insights, it's really to build empathy. When you get somebody in the room with a user, it just changes their mind, it softens them a little bit. It gets them out of their own preconceived notions of what to build, what the strategy should be and...

Chandra Janakiraman (00:27:00):
... their own preconceived notions of what to build, what the strategy should be, and it humanizes the whole process. That I think is the purpose, but you still give them the homework of writing down what they learned because it's a little bit of a forcing function.

(00:27:16):
The output of all of this is what I call the comprehensive preparation readout. It is a single master deck where you sort of have the behavioral insights meta analysis, you have the UXR insights meta analysis, you have a download of the leadership interviews, you have the competitive stack charts, you have the adjacent roadmaps, and you have a section on user observations. It's a lot of work, but to your point, it can be done in parallel with your day jobs. You can multitask, and that's why you take about four weeks to do that. That sort of concludes the preparation phase. You get the deck, and that rolls into the strategy sprint, which is the next phase. I want to pause and see if you have any questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):
Yeah, I have a million questions, but I'm going to keep myself contained. Just to quickly summarize. Basically you kick off, we're going to start developing strategy for this product, and you were going to touch on this, but it may help just to talk about this right now. I know you have big S Strategy, small S strategy. This process, what's an example of the level of product scale that this process is for? Because I know you have another approach for a larger scale of a product, basically for a company. What's the best way to think about small S strategy, which is what we're going through?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:28:37):
Yeah, I think it's a good question, Lenny. I would say that the process works well at sort of a growth stage company or in a vertical within sort of a larger company. I think it scales pretty well. The main difference between this small S and big S is the time horizon aspect and the aspirational component, which we'll get to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:02):
Okay, so this is a process you can use for entire company strategy of not a large company, not a massively, and then also just a product within a company?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:29:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:11):
Okay, perfect. Okay. Hey, we're kicking off strategy for this thing. Let's say VR Chat 2.0. You have this kickoff meeting with your working group. You assign action items and there's six things you ask everyone to do. Gather all the behavioral insights, all the user research insights that you've had, leadership interviews, interview people, ask what they want and see what they're hoping for, what success looks like, competitive analysis, adjacent roadmaps across other teams and user observations, just like watch users, see what's happening. You assign each of these tasks to different people in this working group. You set a deadline. We have to present this in say, four weeks. People go work on it. You meet ongoing as it's coming together, and then the output is a deck that you share. Do you share this deck with just that working group, or who do you share this deck with and read it out to?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:30:02):
Yeah. The deck is an output of the first phase, and then it flows into the second phase, which is a strategy sprint. You don't share the deck with anybody yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):
Got it. This is our secret.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:30:11):
In the strategy sprint, it's like a key thing. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):
Awesome. Okay. I love how very concrete and actionable this is with time boxes and action items and the exact output you're looking for. I love this. Okay, cool. Basically what you're trying to do here is gather all of the input that will inform the strategy.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:30:27):
That's correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:28):
It's giving yourself time to do this, because if you think about it, the output is determined by the quality of your input. I love, it feels like a core component of this method is spend time creating, gathering all the input, all the best input, actually spend time there. Don't just make it a half-assed last minute thing. Okay. Amazing. Okay, let's talk about step two, which is the strategy sprint.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:30:52):
Yeah, so the strategy sprint is the heart of the process. This is sort of where you make the decision. If you recall, the definition of strategy is it forces choice to deploy resources into a few areas for maximum impact. The core of strategy is really picking those areas and the areas you're not going invest in. That happens in the strategy sprint, so really it's the heart of the process.

(00:31:22):
Typically, it's like a three to five day process. The first day is the share out date. Everybody has done some great work. They go in, they share what they've collected, what they've sort of learned. It brings everybody in the working group to the same state of understanding, the same state of consciousness on the state of the union. That's a great process where what I encourage people to do is write down things that you are, as you're listening, write down things that you find are problems for our users, things that are coming in the way of our growth and things that are sort of suboptimal for the business.

(00:32:05):
People take a lot of notes during that time and the people who are presenting are sharing everything they've learned. That's really day one. It's just absorbing a ton of information and writing down a ton of notes so people can kind of understand where all the problems are. It's a very problems focused process, and that's an important point. I'll get back to it when we talk about big S, which is different. Once people have that common awareness, shared knowledge of all the problems, day two is literally the most important day in the entire 8 to 12 weeks because that's where you actually make the choice. The way to flow through it, it's actually really important to flow through it correctly. The first step is really generating a whole bunch of problems, because people have been taking notes the previous day.

(00:32:59):
You start the day with, "Hey, let's collect everybody's thoughts on what the problems are that are holding us back." It's a free flowing session. Everybody throws out their observations on what's holding us back, and you just capture all of that in a Google Sheets, for example. Over even an hour, you start to see these patterns emerging of like, there's these clusters of problems that are really holding us back. The next step is you do a joint clustering of related problems and you create these potentially, typically in my experience, I've seen about 10 to 15 clusters form of very related problems. The beauty of it is each of those bigger cluster, you actually know what the sub problems are within that cluster because you sort of generated it very organically.

(00:33:55):
Then you have, let's say 10 to 15 clusters. What you then do is you, because remember, because it started as a problem generation exercise, each of the clusters also has a name that is a problem, and so the next step is to flip it into an opportunity framing. Let me give you a couple of examples.

(00:34:16):
Let's say there's a bunch of problems around people don't really know where to find different things in our product, and they don't really know where to go, where to find a certain feature or a certain experience. There's let's say a lot of problems in that area, so difficulty finding things becomes the cluster, the problem cluster and discovery becomes the opportunity sort of framing of it. It's sort of the more positive framing of it.

(00:34:46):
Another example could be that people get a lot of content that they don't like. They see a lot of stuff that they don't like, and so they disengage with the product. The opportunity framing of that would be relevance. It's basically stuff that really matters to me. Maybe if it's a social product, then maybe people are finding it difficult to find friends and they are lonely because of that. The opportunity framing would be social connection.

(00:35:20):
Flipping all of those problem clusters into positive framing and opportunity framing is the next step. Then you're in a great spot because now all you have to do is you have to down select from those 10 to 15 opportunity areas into ideally three, maybe five, but I would recommend three because it creates more clarity and focus. The way to do that is really sort of ranking them on, I would say four or five key dimensions or criteria, and the first is expected impact.

(00:35:56):
Let's say you actually tackle that area. What is the expected impact to whatever matters to you as a company, as a business, as a product? The second dimension is certainty of impact. Certainty of impact is basically how concrete is the evidence that this is a problem? Sometimes you have really hard data, sometimes you have more anecdotal evidence, and so the confidence really depends on how big the problem's sizing and frequency is. Expected impact, certainty of impact. The third one is also very important, which is clarity of levers.

(00:36:34):
Do you actually have an idea of how you would solve it? If you don't, it's going to be really difficult to move the needle on it because you should kind of know that, okay, I can imagine these solutions could actually move the needle. I can actually launch this sort of nudge system that can help people find things. I can recommend people. I can recommend friends so that people can form friends quicker on the platform. You should have a sense of how you would solve that particular space. Is there clarity on levers? That's the third dimension.

(00:37:08):
The fourth dimension is super important, which is are the levers unique and differentiated to that particular team or company? Which is that if another team or company could build it better than this particular team or company, then it's probably not that differentiated. It's probably going to be pretty generic once you launch it. It's a combination of sort of like, is there a lot of impact here? How confident are we of the problem? Do we have a sense of the solutions? And basically, are we the team or company that has the capabilities and the skills to uniquely build it where other teams cannot?

(00:37:52):
Once you have that, and sometimes what happens is you don't have too much data, and so it's okay to have qualitative scores on this like high, medium, low, T-shirt scores, whatever that is. The key is you're doing it together as a strategy working group, and you're debating the scores and you're reasoning why it should be higher versus lower. There's a ton of alignment and collision that's happening when you're doing that, which is very healthy for the eventual outcome.

(00:38:22):
Once you do that, basically you can do a simple sort of addition of the scores and a sort, and what you have is basically the top three and you have the remaining 7 or 12 that are basically not the focus. That's the core of the process, is getting those opportunity areas and getting to a shared sense of how do we prioritize them and why?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):
Okay, and this is all done in a week. I know there's more to it. There's a couple more items that help you move from what you just said to the next step, but I love that this is the core of the biggest element of the process, and you do it in a week and you're only able to do it in a week because of the work you did ahead of time. Again, highlighting the importance of that prep step.

(00:39:13):
Just to share what you've shared so far, and then we'll finish the strategy sprint step. It's basically do the share out so everyone's on the same page about all the information that, all the inputs essentially. Enumerate all the problems, like individual small problems and then cluster them into 10 to 15 problem clusters. Flip it from here's the problem to here's an opportunity we have. Rank them based on, basically there's these four attributes you shared, which I'll actually, I wrote these down. Impact potential, confidence that it will have the impact, clarity of levers and are they differentiated unique levers? Is there something different from what other folks are doing? Those are ways to rank these ideas and problem clusters. You essentially come up with, here's three bets basically we potentially should take. Okay, and then I think that's where you stopped. Is that right?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:40:03):
That's totally right, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:06):
Okay, cool.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:40:06):
Those three that are at the top of that pile are basically our strategic pillars. We've sort of gotten our strategic pillars and they basically hold up the strategy. That's why they're called strategic pillars. The idea is once you have the strategic pillars, we basically translate that into a few how might we's? Let's say it's a relevance thing. How might we find the best content for a particular user? How might we surface it in the right place? There's a few how might we's, and the how might we's are basically intended to help the next phase of the process, which is the design sprint.

(00:40:43):
You generate these areas, these strategic pillars, you generate the how might we's. How might we's are typically pretty straightforward. Once you have the strategic pillars, it takes probably an hour to generate some how might we's for each of them, maybe two or three for each strategic pillar, and then you're done with that stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):
I just want to highlight real quick, this phrasing is really important. I used exactly the same phrasing. I had a PM that I worked with and his name was Andrew Chen, but not the Andrew Chen people know about, that's an investor, who had this concept of fertile questions that create ideas and spark ideas and solutions. This phrase, "How might we", is actually really powerful as a way to come up with ideas to solve problems. It's just like, how might we increase discoverability in our app? How might we improve relevance? There's something magical about that phrasing that it opens up your mind to, how might we? Let's think about it. Versus like, how do we improve discovery? That's a different, your brain works differently hearing this. That is a really powerful phrasing. Just wanted to highlight that.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:41:47):
Yeah, that's awesome. It's also something that designers are familiar with, Lenny, so it flows really well into sort of a design sprint.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):
Okay, so you have these how might we'd. You have three pillars, maybe three or four or five how might we's to solve these opportunities/problems, and then what happens after that?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:42:06):
Exactly. Then the third day is it's good to start fresh. The team's accomplished a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):
This was all the first two days.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:42:14):
This is the first two days, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):
Wow. Okay. So much done in two days.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:42:18):
Yeah, exactly. The second day is particularly intense on the team, so it's good to give them a break, because it's a lot of really mental sort of wrestling, and so give the team a bit of a break. Then the third day is when people are a little bit refreshed, we get to winning aspiration. Winning aspiration is super interesting because it's a very creative exercise. You basically imagine in two years, because that's the typical time horizon of a smaller strategy, is like 18 months to 24 months. This is what I tell the team. Imagine two years there's a newspaper, there's a journalist that covers this work, and there's a newspaper article that comes out. I want you to imagine the progress on all these strategic pillars and what the headline of that newspaper article looks like. It's called a newspaper headline approach.

(00:43:09):
Basically, everybody generates a newspaper headline in parallel. It's interesting because you often see there's these common themes that sort of form when people generate these headlines. The forcing function with the headline is also that it has to be somewhat simple and plain speak. It's not too technical. You have to get to a more simple layperson's language and you have to get to the key benefit that ultimately, the impact it has on the world. Those kinds of themes come up often.

(00:43:44):
Then you do a little bit, you put them all into a blender, you put all of those headlines from the team into a blender, and you mash them together and create the winning aspiration, which is ultimately what does progress on the strategy look like in a couple of years time? That comes from the working group, it's not like one person writing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):
What's an example of an aspiration that you've come up with on a project you worked on, a winning aspiration?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:44:14):
We did this process for the privacy team when I was at Meta. Really the strategic pillars were around a lot of features that we would build, but the winning aspiration was really like, could we move consumer trust? The newspaper headline is something like, "Facebook has moved the needle on consumer trust by investing in these areas." That's how you create the bigger impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:47):
That's a great example. Obviously this is similar to the PR Amazon method and what I love about your approach, as you said early on, is you're just pulling together all of these awesome ideas from all these different methods of strategy work to a very methodical step-by-step process. Taking all the best ideas into, and as you described, an operator's playbook for doing this. I love that. Okay. When you say blender, by the way, I was thinking as you were talking, put them into a blender, what I'm inferring is you just take everyone's headlines and you come up with one that kind of covers the gamut of all three pillars being successful.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:45:20):
That's exactly right. More tactically what I typically do is I put them all on a slide and start, it's almost like a word cloud, and then you start to see these common words. Then you converge those words as the key elements of the final winning aspiration. Then you try to create a nice statement out of that. It also symbolically, everybody sees their own statement on the deck, and that's how you get to the final model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:46):
Awesome. I feel like AI could help with that now.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:45:46):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:48):
Just put in all your headline ideas and it comes up with some suggestions. Okay, cool. Is that the end of the sprint or is there more to the sprint?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:45:55):
That's it for the sprint.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:57):
Okay. At the end of the sprint, what do you have? What are the outputs?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:46:00):
Yeah, this is a great progress on strategy because now we have the three strategic pillars. We have the how might we associate it with the strategic pillars. You also have the why. Why did you get to those three strategic pillars and what are you not focused on and what are the reasons for it? You also have the winning aspiration. It's great progress. The team's done a great job. I think now we sort of move on to the design sprint.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:30):
In your experience, how often are these three the correct three that you end up going with versus you learn something over the course of the rest of the sprint and adjust?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:46:38):
It's a very good question. We'll speak about an example that I had in Meta where typically during the strategy sprint, you don't change it once you go through the strategy sprint, but eventually there are a lot of signals you get through execution where you sort of have to course correct. We'll talk about one very interesting example of how that sort of changed things here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:01):
Awesome. Okay. Basically, you've developed your strategy at this point, and in your experience it ends up being... Until you hit the market and test, you don't really know what's going on.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:47:01):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:10):
But there's kind of an implication that in your experience doing this, I think you said five or six times, it has been correct and as good as doing it any other approach.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:47:21):
I would say it's not sort of an empirical study, obviously because of the small sample size, but I would say that it's really opened people's eyes and it's led to really good alignment and eventually good results. Even when it has not, it has led to good organizational buy-in on why and how we are approaching things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:42):
This reminds me of, Tomer Cohen was on the podcast, he's CPO of LinkedIn and he has this phrase that always says he says, which is, "We may be wrong, but we're not confused." I love that a core part of this is everyone is completely on the same page, not from the beginning, but once you start this process of here's all the inputs, here's step by step we are working together on narrowing down, so at least everyone understands the why. Which is what sparked your interest in this in the first place, everyone understanding. I know there's a whole rollout at the end too to solve that.

(00:48:14):
Okay, cool, so we have the sprint. We have basically the three pillars that you're going to invest in, this headline of what it might look like if you're to launch and some solution ideas with how might we's. What comes next?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:48:26):
Yeah. The next phase is the design sprint, and the design sprint can be led by the design person who's in the strategy working group. If you remember, there's engineering, product design and data, so the design person can lead it and the PM can sort of take a bit of a backseat during this process. The input to the design sprint is sort of the three strategic pillars and the how might we's associated with it.

(00:48:50):
The goal of the design sprint is not to sort of come up with these are the features we should build. That's not the purpose of the design sprint. The design sprint is to generate a lot of illustrative concepts that bring the strategy to life because a picture is worth a thousand words. Oftentimes, even though you might have the right words in your strategy doc, people might still scratch their head like, "What do you exactly mean? What are you going to build?" The illustrative concepts really sort of give people something to latch onto, "Oh, okay, I get it. This is what you're going to build at the end of the day with this strategy."

(00:49:25):
The more generative, the better. Then there's the ability to, sometimes if you do the Google Ventures design sprint, you can even test some of it with users and get a little bit of sharpening of things. The goal here is not to build feature-ready designs, it's more to generate concepts. Once you have that, basically the design sprint, and there's different flavors of design sprints, which I won't go into. You can lean on your design lead to decide what's the appropriate way, but the input and the output is what needs to be very emphasized. The input needs to be the strategic pillars. The output needs to be a ton of illustrative concepts to explain each strategic pillar. You could almost have a section where you talk about each strategic pillar and insert those concepts in that section. That's the idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:16):
We're going to go through a couple examples to make this very real. You mentioned the design sprint method, which we had the authors on the podcast. They actually didn't go through the design sprint method. They have another book called Make Time that's about productivity. We also had their colleague from Google Ventures that designed a bullseye sprint, which is also an interesting sprint. It's a new thing that helps you figure out your ICP and who to focus your product on and how that informs your product.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:50:40):
Oh, that's right. Interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:41):
It's another type of sprint you could use here. The input is here's the three things we're going to invest in, say discovery, relevance, privacy. The output is here's concepts of what this could look like to get people's minds going. Is it just a bunch of mocks basically in a deck at this point?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:51:00):
That's correct. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):
Okay, cool. Okay, amazing. That's a week. That's another sprint. PM could maybe take a little bit of a break.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:51:06):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):
And designers take the lead.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:51:09):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:09):
The engineers are kind of inputs and thought partners in this, I imagine.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:51:13):
They're optional. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:15):
Optional, but yeah, ideally they're involved because you want all the best ideas in there.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:51:19):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):
Okay, cool. What comes next?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:51:21):
Then the next step is the document writing. This is sort of a solo activity that the PM should take on, but the great news is the PM is not starting from scratch. There's so much great stuff to write. If you remember, there's a ton of user insights, a ton of behavioral insights, a ton of competitive analysis. There's the three strategic pillars, how might we's, winning aspiration. There's a whole bunch of illustrative concepts.

(00:51:48):
Oftentimes, product leads have this sort of creator's block. That is solved here completely because you have a ton of great material. I have to tell you, it doesn't make the job easier. You still have to weave together a good story. That's why I think it takes a week or two. I think it's really about combining, connecting and editing at this point and telling a cohesive story from all those components, but I think the building blocks are really solid and defensible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:17):
Is there a template or kind of sections you like to include in your strategy doc? As someone sits down and is trying to write this out, what do you want to see there as headings?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:52:26):
I think you could almost take the building blocks as a little bit of a steer for the template. You start with the broader context where you talk about what the leaders kind of want from this overall effort. Then you get into key insights and analysis where you have user insights, behavioral insights, competitive analysis. Then you get into the strategic pillars and you explain them. You also explain why. In the appendix, you include the full table that you generated on day two of your strategy sprint. You include the full table in the appendix, including the criteria. That's going to be really important because most people are going to ask, "Why did you pick these?" That's basically sort of the defensibility.

(00:53:17):
Then you have the winning aspiration that's very bold. It's a big part of the heart of the deck, and you sort of embed the illustrative concepts into the actual each of the strategic pillars so that it flows well. Then finally, you end with some kind of alignment questions like, "Hey, do these feel right? Are there things we are missing?" So that it creates that framework for alignment in the subsequent meetings.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:53:52):
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):
... and to scale and watershed, I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina (00:54:09):
Yes, so we just launched one scheme of file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder.

(00:54:18):
We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:31):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap, and instead use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever?

Christina (00:54:43):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations.

(00:54:55):
We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:02):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us, and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:55:17):
I pulled up Playing to Win, which I know you also pull ideas from, and actually Roger Martin was on the podcast talking about this stuff. And one way I think about it as you're describing a way to break up your strategy doc, is he has these five questions that you ask.

(00:55:31):
The first is actually what's your winning aspiration? So I love that you're pulling that in. This is one approach your doc would be. What's your winning aspiration? Where will you play? What market are you going after? How will you win? What capabilities must be in place for you to win? And then what management systems are required?

(00:55:46):
We'll link to this framework just in case people want that as a crutch in their thinking strategy, but is there anything that we could link folks to that describe how you like to think about this doc? And if not, it'd be cool if you make a template that folks could borrow.

Chandra Janakiraman (00:56:00):
I'm happy to share of the flowchart of the process and the template as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):
Awesome. Okay. So this is how long of a process, this writing of the document?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:56:10):
It's about one to two weeks, and I think it's mostly solo work and hopefully by the end of it there's a very tight doc, and that's what we use to roll out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:21):
And by solo work, I imagine you're looping in this working team to get their feedback as you're pulling it together, or is it just you sit there in a room and then...

Chandra Janakiraman (00:56:27):
I would minimize pulling them in, because they've all contributed so much to the process already. So, I would say that at the end of it, obviously, once you have a draft, it's good to share with them, but I wouldn't tap their cycles too much at this point, because they've given a lot already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:47):
I see. Okay.

(00:56:48):
And how many pages do you see this doc being, roughly? What's a heuristic?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:56:52):
It's not too long. I would say probably three or four pages and then an appendix has a lot of additional... Like, the table I spoke about and a lot of additional maybe illustrative concepts. Maybe you can only use a few illustrative concepts in the main section so that there could be others there.

(00:57:09):
I think usually there's a desire from leaders to say, "Okay, what are we building next?" And it's important not to include a roadmap as part of a strategy doc, because a strategy doc is meant to be separate from the roadmap. It's meant to be a companion to your roadmap. And even though there's interest, maybe sometimes you can include a illustrative roadmap in the appendix, but I would try to keep it clean and try to keep it focused on just the strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:40):
So at this point you basically developed your strategy, the next step, I think you call rollout, where you just start actually rolling this out, so let's talk about that. But it's important to note how many weeks in this is. This is like six-ish weeks of work and you've got a strategy for your company/product?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:57:58):
That's exactly right. So I think you're probably in the last two to three weeks of the process, and pretty important final step is the rollout, and I would start with what I call gatekeepers. And these are people who are absolutely... You have to get their one-on-one alignment and blessing on this before it moves forward. And it's probably not too many, probably two or three people. So I would pre-flight it with them and get their alignment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:28):
So these are one-on-one meetings with these gatekeepers?

Chandra Janakiraman (00:58:29):
These are one-on-one meetings. Exactly.

(00:58:31):
And then there's a larger group of what I call key stakeholders, people who are impacted by it, different functional leaders, et cetera. And that can be done either async or through a group review. And then there's probably a rolling of list of team roadshows. There's different ways to do this, but the one that I feel is most effective is the roadshow where you have about eight to 10 people in each session, so people feel more comfortable to ask questions and it's more conversational.

(00:59:06):
So the purpose of this stage is to land it. It's not to seek too much feedback, so it's a delicate balance. At the same time, you don't want to appear just being too inflexible. So it's a very delicate balance. When people ask questions, you can clarify it, and you can add clarifications to the doc, but I wouldn't change... The most important thing, three strategic pillars, I wouldn't change that. I would defend it using the framework, but if people are like, "there's really good arguments about the criteria that led to your ranking," then it's okay to reconsider it. I've not seeing it happen in my five to six attempts, but it's possible, theoretically possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):
The core of this approach it sounds like, is you've done a lot of the pre-work where you land in a generally correct place.

(00:59:55):
Okay, so this is the rollout. So what I'm thinking as you talk, say you're like a PM on a team, say you're working on privacy, it's like an IC, your ICPM, working on strategy. How do you think about including, say, your manager because through this process, when do you start to like, "Hey, here's what we're planning, here's what we're thinking," making sure they're on board? Because I could see this working team off to the side working, working, working. "Okay, we're ready to roll it out." Oftentimes there's like, "No, wait. There's all this other stuff happening at the company, we don't have resources." Where do you loop them in? How do you think about that kind of stakeholder?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:00:29):
The the more attuned PMs who understand organizational dynamics, probably keep the manager pretty in sync through the process. I think, definitely, the manager becomes a person who you interview as part of the leadership interviews, so you know what the manager's looking for from the effort.

(01:00:49):
And then once you get to the strategic pillars on day two of the strategy sprint, you probably want to just quickly pre-flight it with the manager and say, "Hey, look, this is how it's trending, and these are the things we are probably not going to do" and any issues with that. And then eventually you actually want your manager to support you in some of these bigger meetings, so you enlist their help. So I would say that it's probably each individual style, but I would keep them pretty aligned through the process. But you don't have to be too heavy [inaudible 01:01:23], just be super light.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:24):
Great. Makes a lot of sense to me. There's like a...

(01:01:26):
We're not going to solve everyone's problems with this one framework, maybe just quickly touch on resourcing. As you think about this. Like a part of a strategy includes like, oh, we also need these resources. Just any thoughts on how to include that? And then I want to get into some examples of how you've actually implemented this.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:01:42):
So I actually don't recommend thinking about resources in the strategy phase, because what you're saying is, "these are the areas of focus" and the resourcing question becomes more relevant from a road mapping standpoint.

(01:01:55):
Because then you say, "Okay, what percentage of our engineering do we put on strategic pillar A, versus B, versus C? And what are the specific things we build?" So it becomes a road-mapping question as opposed to a strategy question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:08):
And so by the end of this, the rollout, the part of the rollout is developing the actual roadmap. We're not going to get deep into that. That could be part two, solve every PM's problems, teach them all the steps of the process, but we're going to cut it off at, here's you have a strategy that is starting to be rolled out.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:02:24):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:25):
Cool.

(01:02:25):
Let's go through a couple examples where you actually move into this to make this even more real. I know there's a couple companies you were thinking about sharing, strategies you worked on.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:02:35):
I think there's just three quick notes to close off this process and I'll share two examples, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:44):
Perfect.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:02:46):
So the reason I think this process works, the first is because there is a ton of alignment built in within team alignment and leadership alignment built in. And it's not seen as, "Oh, this PM went off and wrote this strategy doc and I don't agree with most of it." And part of this is actually very...

(01:03:09):
It goes back to human psychology of just something that comes from you, feels a lot more familiar and easy to accept. So this doc is actually not from the PM, the PM is facilitating it, but it's actually from the strategy working group. And the strategy working group are the leads of the team. And so it's actually... And the leadership inputs have been baked in, so it's actually very team representative. And so hopefully there isn't too much misalignment when you roll it out. And I have seen that, I've seen that work out.

(01:03:43):
The second is there's just better results. You get to better problem articulation, you get a better strategic pillar, because there's just more minds on it than if it was just a product lead.

(01:03:55):
And the third thing is you have clearly defensible criteria and outputs, and if you want to change it, like I said, you have to go back to the criteria and the scoring and then say, "Okay, why do we believe this has to be changed?" And even a change is easy to justify once you do that. So it creates a lot of benefits, but ultimately, and we'll get to this a little bit more, it has to be tested with execution, and that's the most important thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):
I think it's important to highlight, no framework playbook [inaudible 01:04:26] method is going to guarantee you have the correct strategy that will win and your company will thrive. It's always just the best effort at plan.

(01:04:35):
As the quote, "no good plan survives first contact with the customer."

Chandra Janakiraman (01:04:41):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:42):
Cool. Let's talk through some examples.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:04:45):
so the first example I wanted to talk about is at Zynga. I was at Zynga a very long time ago, and this was the heyday of social gaming on Facebook. The thing that I was extremely impressed about Zynga was the strategic clarity and strategic encoding at the company. And this was not attributable to me, by the way, this was already there when I got there as a entry-level PM, but the kind of strategic clarity there was really, really impressive and it was very evident and observable from all the games.

(01:05:22):
So if you look at all the games, there were three elements that were very common across all the games. The first was viral game loops. There's these game loops that just required you to have a social and active social network to be successful and play, and it was very tightly and fictionally integrated into the core of the gameplay. That was the first one.

(01:05:47):
The second one was there was this idea of paying to complete things. So you're not paying to skip a whole experience, what you're paying is just to complete it. So what happens then is different people, depending on how much time they have, complete different percentages of a progression task, or a part of the gameplay, and you only had to pay the rest to get through the experience. And it was this interesting experience where people put a lot of investment into it, and they didn't mind paying for the last 20% or 30%, which was very interesting, because it created this market for different elasticity of spend, different times that people had in their lives. And it was very, very clever. So that was again, very common across all the games.

(01:06:38):
And then the third was network. So all of Zynga games had this cross-promotional component at the top of the game and they would promote other games, and it's like the Zynga network was the most important thing, and not an individual game. And those were the three in our parlance now strategic pillars, and there were non-focus areas. It wasn't like...

(01:07:05):
The focus wasn't on high-fidelity graphics, it wasn't on complex game mechanics, and this was extremely clear and hard-coded into the company culture and operations. And it was perfectly tuned to the environment at the time. Facebook platform afforded strong support with social graph, and channels, and basically the game studios contributed through different games in a very network accretive way.

(01:07:31):
So for example, I was at Zynga San Diego, and we took the company into net new game genres like action strategy, match three puzzle games, but we stayed true to the strategic pillars of the company, and we had to invent new mechanics so that the strategic pillars would work in the new genres that we introduced to the company. And what was fascinating is the company actually had systems to reinforce these strategic pillars.

(01:07:57):
And, for example, the data infrastructure was very incredible at the time, and really reinforced these strategic pillars. There was this function called Central Product Management, which basically propagated best practices, made sure that games were network accretive and all these things worked in harmony to enhance those strategic pillars and reinforce it, and it worked really well. The company, if I remember right, got to a billion dollars, it was the fastest to get to a billion dollars in the history of companies at the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):
In revenue.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:08:33):
In revenue.

(01:08:35):
And it worked really well until the environment changed and there was a shift to mobile. And temporarily... Basically, if you go back to that resonance concept, that deep resonance between the product and the market was temporarily lost once that shift happened to mobile.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):
So there's a lot here. I think one interesting note here is, as you said, the strategy work you're doing, which sounds like a lot of time, eight to 12 weeks potentially, this lasted a long time for Zynga. And so I think it's important to remember the work you're doing here, even though...

(01:09:06):
On the one hand it feels like a long time, on the other hand, it feels like very little time to come up with the things that will most help your business grow. In this case, these three elements for Zynga. And by the way, these three pillars, they didn't emerge from this method, but it helped you see the power of being very clear...

Chandra Janakiraman (01:09:24):
Clear, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:25):
And having everything centered around, we all agree, these are the three ways we win. Okay, cool. And then I think the number three, again, I just want to highlight the power of just very few bets in investments. So it's always three. I've always suggested three as well. Some people are like, "three to five," but I think it's... You just find, in general, three is the right number as much? Try very, very hard to make it three?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:09:46):
I agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):
Okay, cool.

(01:09:48):
And then I think there's also this element of differentiation being really important. So these three elements you shared for Zynga are just like they're unique and differentiated for Zynga. Network, powers of apps driving other apps, paying to complete, these are things Zynga has figured out, "this is how we" win versus other products in the market.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:10:08):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:09):
Sweet. Anything else along those lines with Zynga?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:10:13):
That was in hindsight reflection, Lenny, I was pretty naive when I was there, and I realized how... And this was, in fact, what led to my blind spot when I joined Headspace from Zynga, that you even need a strategy. That's the story I said at the beginning.

(01:10:33):
The reason is because Zynga had it figured out so well that I didn't actually have a need to exercise that muscle at Zynga, and we just had to come up with new games that applied that strategy. And so it was a net new muscle I had to develop when I got to Headspace.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):
It's like that parable of the fish swimming in the water where the older fish swims by and he's like, "How's the water?" And they're like, "Hmm?" And then he leaves and he's like, "What's water?" You just don't realize what you're in. You don't realize what you're surrounded by until it's gone.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:11:06):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:07):
Maybe one other thing I just want to highlight while we're on this topic is just the power of focus. In the case of Zynga, just this focus on everything we do needs to get these things, these three things, everything we do, we need to do in order to win. And I think that's a recurring theme in what you're talking about, is just focus. The steps of the process are focus on this one part for now. So I think that's a really interesting thread is just the power of focus.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:11:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):
Okay, cool.

(01:11:35):
And now you have another example of your time at Meta.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:11:37):
At Meta there's this fascinating example, which I think illustrates a different point, which is...

(01:11:46):
Basically I was standing up the product strategy for a couple of product growth teams in Reality Labs, Oculus, which was coming up with the Quest II at the time. This is a standalone headset, and then Portal, which was our video conferencing product. And we stood up these teams to go after product growth, which is basically driving hardware sales through software features. And we went through this process that I just described. We stood up strategic pillars, and the strategic pillars were fairly similar for both Portal, which is our video conferencing product, and Oculus.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):
I love Portal by the way. I was a big fan of... Sad that it's no longer around.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:12:31):
And that led to features that are known to everybody, like the Oculus Referrals Program, the Portal Memories Integration, where you see one of your Facebook memories on the Portal, sponsored ad in your Facebook feed. And also we had this section on the Facebook app, which is also from Facebook at the time, and then eventually also from Meta, which is these other products from the Facebook ecosystem. And all those came out of that effort.

(01:13:01):
And about 18 months into it, they actually had very different outcomes. So on one hand the Oculus effort was incredibly successful, and we graduated it into the VR division at Meta, and till today it continues to be an incredibly successful effort. The Portal effort actually didn't move the needle as much as we wanted to, and we sunset it, and we basically redeployed that team to other initiatives. And that's super interesting. Basically it was like the same strategy process. We got the nearly identical strategic pillars, but eventually completely different outcomes.

(01:13:49):
And I think that that illustrates the most important point about strategy, which is intrinsically strategy has no business value. It's basically a document with a few words. And I think it starts accumulating value as you generate business impact and results. And that happens when you actually test strategy with execution.

(01:14:15):
And so ultimately any strategy is only as good as the results it produces. And so one has to have the intellectual honesty, and the humility, and the courage to say when it's working and when it's not. And sometimes what happens is parts of your strategy might work, parts might not, and you have to pivot away from some and double down on some. But I do think there's that evaluation that's really critical and testing strategy with execution.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):
Such a great point. Just a strategy sitting there in a doc is worthless, where the worth comes from, is it actually having impact and being successful. Makes me think about a product manager also, just a PM is not worth anything until they help you drive impact.

(01:15:02):
I think an important, to trickle down from that point, is that you don't want to spend too long just thinking about strategy, you want to spend as little time as possible to get to a strong hypothesis, basically to start learning if this is the right path. And so I love that your approach is like this middle ground between give it real time, but don't spend three, four or five months working on this one document that just maybe one day you'll use.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:15:31):
Exactly.

(01:15:31):
And there is room for a six-month process, which we'll get to in a moment. But for small S I wouldn't recommend more than two or three months.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:39):
And again, small S strategy is for a couple of years out, not like Exactly. It's like a timeframe. Okay, cool.

(01:15:47):
Okay. Anything else along those lines of the examples of Meta or Zynga?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:15:53):
Those are pretty good lessons I would say.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:55):
Okay, sweet.

(01:15:56):
So, let's talk about big-S strategy. When should you approach strategy this way and what are just the steps of it?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:16:06):
So everything we've spoken about so far is what I would call small S, and it's very problem focused. It's basically what I call present forward.

(01:16:17):
It's like you have something, you have a product out there, it has a bunch of problems. How do we make it better for... What are the areas we tackle for maximum impact? Typically led by product managers. And there's this interesting quote by Elon Musk, which is, "Life has to be about more than just solving problems." And he says it in the context of the aspiration to become a multi-planetary species, but I think this is true of every company, big or small. And there needs to be an aspirational and cool component to strategy. And I call this big-S strategy.

(01:16:56):
I'll run through this at a higher level because I think this is a little bit more fluid in how you build the big-S strategy. And it typically takes longer, potentially up to about six months. The approach is a bit different from small S. And you start with the company mission and vision, and there is a little bit of groundwork that is done on long-term cultural trends, social trends, competitive trends, technological trends, and those are all the backdrop to trigger ideas. And what you do with that backdrop is you, again, do these leadership interviews, but with a different goal of generating long-term futures.

(01:17:41):
And some of the questions you can ask during these interviews are "What does a day in the life of a user look like in five years? What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?" And basically take all of that input and cluster it into I would say, three cohesive holes.

(01:18:05):
And what I mean by that is three, at least fairly distinct, descriptions of the future. So to give you almost a very simple example, imagine you doing big S for the future of travel. You could have a future that is talking all about fully autonomous travel, where there's very little human involvement in going from A to B. You could talk about another future where there's extreme speed, where you can get from A to B really fast across the world that is really fast. You could talk about a third where there is no travel, it's virtual travel, and you still have the feeling of travel, and you accomplish the same goals.

(01:18:45):
But those are different futures, they have different properties, like different elements to them. And once you generate those distinct futures, you actually generate prototypes with learning goals. And think of these prototypes as concept cars. And the automobile industry uses this notion of concept cars. Concept cars, the interesting thing about concept cars is they're never commercialized. They're often produced for inspiration, and to potentially take some part of them, like maybe a technology or a feature, and that is brought into mainstream production.

(01:19:23):
So think of these prototypes as these concept cars that really drive inspiration and potentially give you some small nuggets that you can run with. And then you start doing research with them with potential users, you answer key questions, and you uncover certain elements that resonate with people. So you eliminate a whole bunch of stuff, you combine a whole bunch of stuff, and you establish some winning components that are interesting.

(01:19:48):
And then what you do is you push stuff that is winning into the product, live product, testing. So this is actually something that you actually want to start testing your way into and understanding if it works from a scalable standpoint. And this whole thing is typically led not by the PM team, but by design and UXR. And intentionally it's a little bit more open-ended and green field. And it actually is a very different mind space that people have when they approach big. So the roadmap is really built through a combination of small-S and big-S work. And, for example, at VRChat, we are doing both small-S and big-S work, Lenny. And they are run as parallel work streams. The product management team is leading the charge of the small-S work, and the design team is leading the charge on the big-S work. And it's really exciting stuff. What's coming out of both work streams is really exciting and really different. And so we are building the bridge from both sides and both work streams ultimately flow into one roadmap. It's almost like two tributaries that ultimately merge into one river. That's how I would think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):
There's so many things here that are so...

Chandra Janakiraman (01:21:01):
That's how I would think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):
There's so many things here that are so interesting. One is we've had this conversation on the podcast a couple of times, this point that people think and see the world differently. Some people are very open-minded and creative, and think big, blue sky people. Some people, me, just like, "What are we doing next? How do we move this metric? Let's talk about concrete things that we can do?" For this big S approach, I think what I'm hearing is make sure the people leading it are very open-minded, creative, blue sky type people. If you're the person that's like, "How will this move our metric?" Maybe you shouldn't be leading it and give someone else the reins.

(01:21:40):
Cool. And then with these timelines of doing both at once, it's probably hard to align them fully. So what I'm hearing is it's like these are kind of ongoing sometimes.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:21:49):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):
And they'll both inform what you're doing. You don't need to have this perfect timeline of-

Chandra Janakiraman (01:21:54):
I agree to this. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Sweet. And the big thinking I love, because sometimes, you may experience this, designers often are like, "Oh, we just work on all this boring, incremental optimization stuff. I want to think bigger." Which is great, and this is a really good lever to allow for that in a contained environment. Cool. Let's just go crazy. Let's think about what this could be in the future. Still, let's make sure we're moving some metrics short-term, but let's give us opportunity to think big. And oftentimes the biggest ideas come out of that. So I love it's giving space for both types of thinking, thinking bigger and thinking long term.

(01:22:30):
Anything else about these two methods that might be interesting to share? Otherwise, I want to talk about AI a little bit, just how that impacts things and a couple other things.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:22:39):
Yeah, yeah. I'll end on one short sort of note on how this all feels when you do it, and then we can segue into AI-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:47):
Great, great.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:22:48):
... Lenny. So I think that whether it's big S or small S, these are incredibly satisfying processes to go through in the end. So once you get to the end, they're incredibly deeply satisfying. But with anything in life that is very deeply satisfying at the end, they have a ton of challenge, frustration, and dead ends while you go through it where you kind of get a lot of self-doubt like, "Hey, will you ever reach the end?" And I just want to sort of normalize that. That's actually normal and I want people to expect that as they go through it. And I think that's what makes it even more rewarding when you get to that sort of point where you start to see things connecting.

(01:23:33):
The second thing is I would say that the person who's leading the charge on these efforts has to be really good at connecting diverse viewpoints and keeping them all moving forward. And it's not easy, it's very hard because sometimes you have people who take you in different directions and you have to keep it all hanging together.

(01:23:57):
So in terms of picking people who have that skill, who are good integrators, who are good connect the dots, I think it's critical for these to be successful. And in some ways low ego because it's not like... They do get to introduce their own ideas, but truly, it's about bringing the team together. So that's the skill that you should look for for these leads.

(01:24:22):
And then the third piece is I would say that I would just approach these with a little bit of a lighter touch and more playful sort of approach, because it's an intensive process, it's a long process. And people can get tired, they can find it grindy. So just having a little bit of playfulness along the way goes a long way in making it feel more tolerable for the people going through it. So those are some thoughts about either of these processes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):
That was really important context, especially this will be frustrating throughout. It sounds really beautiful and great and smooth as you describe it. In reality, there's a lot of pain that goes into... Because you're making hard decisions. A lot of people have opinions, they have perspectives, there's data that's... Rarely is there clear answer from the beginning, so I think that's really important context.

(01:25:08):
I wanted to actually come back to your point you made about how Elon made this point about life shouldn't just be about solving problems. I think part of that quote is just like we should work on things that are awesome and exciting and inspiring, that aren't just immediately pain solvers. And he's very good at that, just inspiring people to what could be, and we should be thinking much bigger than we are.

(01:25:32):
I was actually at an interview with Zuck where he said the same thing. He's probably inspired by Elon. He's like, "I've just gotten to a point in my career where I want to work on awesome stuff, stuff that is just awe inspiring, not just-

Chandra Janakiraman (01:25:43):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:44):
... another social feature." so I think that's a really important point. And there's a lot of power in that. People get really excited about holy moly, I did not imagine this is what Headspace could become, what VRChat could become, what Meta could become. It's just really powerful, getting people really inspired. And I love this process they shared of how to do that.

(01:26:03):
And I didn't actually summarize it, so I have it right here in front of me. I'll just share the five steps of the biggest process. So it's preparation, mission, you figure [inaudible 01:26:10] mission, vision, trends, interview people about where they think things are going. Then you come up with three distinct futures of what the future might look like if you were to do the things you're thinking. Then you build prototypes of what might this look like? And then you actually test these in your product, which I love, to start de-risking these ideas. That helps you converge to here's actual plan we want to execute, and then you turn that into roadmap.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:26:36):
Yeah, yeah. And the first testing of the prototypes is with UXR, so it's more sort of concept testing or prototype testing with a handful of users. And then you use that as synthesizing to a live product test.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:50):
Great. Basically, it's like big ideas and then de-risking, validating them along the way-

Chandra Janakiraman (01:26:51):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:55):
... in various ways to like, "Okay, maybe this could actually work. Let's try." Sweet. Okay, so just two more things. One is I want to talk about AI briefly, of how that impacts this work. And then two, just maybe a recap of the framework for people that are listening, you're like, "Oh my god, I have so much. I wrote all these notes." Let's give them a summary so they could remember to use it.

(01:27:14):
Okay, cool. So let's talk about AI briefly. How has AI tooling helped you evolve this process? How can people use AI to make this easier?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:27:24):
So the first disclaimer is I'm not sort of an AI futurist, but I read all the emerging stuff that's coming out, most of the emerging stuff that's coming out and use some of the tools. And it's fascinating what's happening. And I think it will definitely have an impact on strategy formulation. So what I'll share is what resonates for me in the context of strategy formulation with AI.

(01:27:52):
So right away, I think the basic idea is everybody should be using assistance in the strategy formulation process with the basic tools that we have. And there are two ways to get AI to assist you in the strategy formulation process. The first is to support the preparation phase in terms of research. And this could be competitive analysis and, for example, you could do trend analysis from a vast library of competitors' release notes. And you can sort of say, "Okay, what are the themes of investment of a competitor's release notes?" Or you could do a reviews analysis of a competitor product and sort of understand what's resonating for users, what's not. And you could also ask a tool like ChatGPT to do a head-to-head comparison between a few players on a certain dimension and really give you a heat map of how they all stack up. And you could also ask an open-ended question like, "Hey, why is this new product so successful? Why is it getting so many users?" And there's some good hypothesis that you usually get. So really leverage in sort of the preparation phase from a competitive analysis standpoint.

(01:29:12):
The second one is in this idea called generating mock strategies. And I know Claire Rowe at your summit spoke about this, and I think this is absolutely right and should be a critical input into the strategy process, which is asking these tools for a mock strategy. And I call this a mock strategy because it's kind of almost the answer but not quite the answer. So what I've found is that these mock strategies, like let's say I support VRChat now and I ask it like, "Hey, what should VRChat do? How should we grow?" And it generates a mock strategy.

(01:29:49):
What I've found is that it's, one, surprisingly good. It's incredibly well-informed and well-articulated. I've also found that its biggest strength is also somewhat its weakness, which is these mock strategies tend to be pretty comprehensive and extensive, and there's an investment recommendation in a vast number of areas. So basically, if you remember, the core of strategy is really to be very targeted and to be very focused. So these mock strategies become an interesting input and the burden is still on the team to down-select into the most important areas for investment. So forcing that choice still, I think, is a human element and needs that layer of additional judgment, which is very context specific to the company. So this is sort of right away, I think people should be doing this.

(01:30:44):
I think more medium term and probably not too distant future and likely sooner than we all think, there's probably going to be, sort of the model that resonates with me is sort of the multi-agent model, which is you probably have different components of the strategy workflow automated. So you probably have a strategy agent, you probably have a roadmap or feature agent, you have maybe a engineering agent, and these can communicate amongst each other to cycle through results and iterate. And I think Armand Ruiz from IBM has some good definitional frameworks on some of the stuff. He shares it often on LinkedIn.

(01:31:27):
But let's take a simple example. I can easily imagine something like this for a topic like onboarding. So every company and product team obsesses about their onboarding experience. And today, there are advanced experimentation frameworks. So imagine you're expecting a large surge in traffic. There's these sort of experimental frameworks like multi-armed bandits that can really help you get to the optimal sort of variation very quickly in real time. And there are variations of that, like contextual multi-armed bandits, there's combinatorial bandits.

(01:32:04):
But the interesting thing is they still rely on human design of the variations, the different variations that you test. Even though the experimentation framework is very sophisticated, the variations are still human generated. Now imagine if those variations could actually be generated through generative AI and could be plugged into the advanced experimentation frameworks. The possibilities become infinite. And really, you might be surprised by what you find is the winning onboarding experience that you couldn't even have humanly imagined. And it might be different for every user, different for every sort of territory, etc.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:44):
That is such a cool idea, I just want to say. This agent that's just running, thinking about ways to optimize your onboarding, coming up with concepts that you probably review, like, "Cool, let's try it." And then it does it, ships an experiment to run it and just is constantly optimizing your onboarding. Holy shit, that's an awesome idea. I think everyone will have this.

(01:33:06):
And then what that makes me think there's going to be some company that's built the best onboarding agent. That's what you're going to be paying for.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:33:14):
Totally. Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:14):
Oh my god, that's so good. Okay. Great. Great idea.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:33:16):
Yeah, yeah. So then the question becomes, hey, what is our job? Our job becomes architecting bigger and bigger pieces of the product to take advantage of these agents. And there will be a sequential increase in the complexity of workloads that get automated over time. Onboarding is probably relatively on the easier side in terms of complexity of workload. And you get into deeper experiences, eventually AI will get there.

(01:33:44):
So funnily enough, when that happens, some of the manual processes I describe about will seem archaic. But I think the fundamentals will still have a long shelf life, and as you think about these automated frameworks as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):
Man, this could be its own podcast. I have this whole post about how AI, how PMs are the best position, role in tech to thrive in a world of AI, which I'll link to that makes people, I find, feel better when they hear you talk about how much might get done through agents in AI.

(01:34:14):
The other quick thought I had, and I want to get to the wrap up, is I have this ongoing debate with a friend about strategy in AI. My feeling is in theory, an AI tool will be incredibly good at coming up with your strategy for you because it's just, here's all the data, here's everything you need to know, how do we win? And to me, that feels like the ultimate way AI is good, is just here's data, here's what I found as a path to a winning. But my friend's also arguing that's the one thing that AI will be least good at because that's where we need people and context and discussion, all these things.

(01:34:53):
I don't know, it's like one or the other. Either AI will be incredibly good at helping you figure out your strategy or the worst.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:34:58):
Interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:00):
I'm curious. I'm curious, I guess, do you have any quick thoughts on that? Where do you side?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:35:05):
I think there is a crossover point where the human judgment will be inferior to something that's able to process multiple signals simultaneously. There's an element of lateral thinking as well here, and I'll sort of share a simple example.

(01:35:24):
For those who drive Tesla cars with the fully self-driving capabilities, when you make a turn, humans have this fairly narrow field of vision. So you have to look both ways and you have to make a decision combining both those signals, right? Whereas the car has six cameras, which is simultaneously processing and it can make a decision not in sequence, but in parallel. And it moves with confidence at turnings because of that. So there is this crossover point where some of these, the ability to hold multiple signals in the head, it's going to be more... It's going to be stronger.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:09):
That makes total sense. What it makes me think about, there's going to be a strategy agent just sitting around always looking for ways to improve your strategy and point you all in a different direction. Oh my god, future is wild, as I've said before.

(01:36:21):
Okay, let's do a quick wrap up of the process for folks that are taking notes and they're like, "Cool, here's the overview." So let's just do that and then let's go to get to the exciting lightning round.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:36:31):
I think the quick recap of everything we've covered is that product strategy definitionally sits between mission vision at the top and plan at the bottom. So it sits between those two either at the company level or at the team level. What it does is it forces choice to deploy scarce resources towards maximum impact. And think about the frequency selection and resonance as an analogy, and it ideally includes three components. A handful of areas to focus on, which we call strategic pillars, and several areas that are explicitly not the focus and why. That's really it in terms of what product strategy is.

(01:37:12):
There is a smallest flavor of it which focuses on solving problems. It's what I call present forward, and it typically operates in a two-year horizon. We use a five-stage process to get there, and it takes about eight to 12 weeks. There is a biggest process that focuses on an aspirational future, is future backward and typically has a three, five, 10-year horizon, also a five-stage process, and can be ongoing up to a six-month period to give it enough space to generate something exciting.

(01:37:47):
And the roadmap for the company or the team is built from a combination of smallest and biggest work, which is like building a bridge from both sides of a river. And ultimately, any strategy is only as good as the results it can produce. So test and iterate through execution and double down on what's working and pivot away from what's not.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:10):
Incredible. I'm glad we did that. Anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:38:18):
Just all the best with strategy work and ultimately individual and business success.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:26):
Amazing. And when I asked you at the beginning, before we started recording, what your goal was for this conversation, your answer was just to create a ripple of success across companies and teams, and I feel like we've done that.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:38:36):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:37):
Okay. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning ground. Chandra, are you ready?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:38:41):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:43):
Let's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:38:47):
Yeah, I love books on creativity and innovation, Lenny, and some of my classic favorites are Walt Disney's biography. And there's several out there, but I think the one that I like the most is the Triumph of the American Imagination. And what's interesting is it talks about how Walt Disney actually loved the theme parks more than the movies. And the reason for that was he could actually tinker with the theme parks. He could make changes to where the rides were, he could change rides in and out, and then he could observe real sort of changes to reactions of people flowing into the theme parks, which he couldn't do with the movies because once it was produced, it was done, it was out of his control. And it was interesting, he was basically A-B testing long before the term was coined. And it's just a fascinating look into how his brain worked, way ahead of its time.

(01:39:46):
The other classic is Ed Catmull's Creativity Inc, and it talks about all the negative forces that eat away at creativity in an organization. How do you, as the leader, have to keep them at bay and make sure the team can innovate?

(01:40:01):
And then there's this probably less popular book, but really good one from Tom Kelly of IDEO, which is The Ten Faces of Innovation. It talks about different archetypes that you need on the team that are essential for creating something special. And you actually need, I think there's the devil's advocate, you need the researcher, you need the ethnographer, you need the stage setter. There's all these interesting personalities that you need to actually make something successful. So I would say those are some of the ones that I usually recommend, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:37):
That's a really cool... That third book is really interesting, I haven't heard of that. And Creativity Inc, something I want to highlight real quick is to your point, that a lot of it is how to avoid killing good ideas. And my favorite metaphor from that book is the ugly baby metaphor where every new idea is an ugly baby that people just want to get rid of. Get rid of this ugly baby, we don't want this around here. And just every new idea is ugly when it starts, and you need to protect the ugly baby, basically. Although I don't know who's hurting ugly babies, that's not-

Chandra Janakiraman (01:41:06):
Yeah, yeah, it feels a bit... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:08):
Feels aggressive.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:41:08):
Harsh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):
Yeah, harsh. Yeah. But it's memorable because I've never forgotten that.

(01:41:14):
Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:41:19):
Yeah, yeah. We watch a lot of animated films with the kids. But were a couple of good movies this year. We really liked If, Imaginary Friend, it's about growing up and forgetting these memories of your younger days, is was a really nice movie. And then of course, we enjoyed Dune II as well. It was a fun watch. But most of our time is dominated by the kids sort of animated folks at home or the cinema.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:53):
There's a new Dune TV show, I don't know if you've been watching it. It just started recently on HBO. It's not the best thing in the world, but it gets you a little Dune fix-

Chandra Janakiraman (01:42:01):
Interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:02):
... in between movies. I think there's a third movie coming out.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:42:04):
I see.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:06):
Third question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:42:10):
Yeah, yeah. I've been playing this cute little game for the last few days. It's called Capybara Go! It's a tab-based strategy RPG game. It's got really humorous writing and this cute capybara that goes off on an adventure. It's very well-paced and it's a very well-produced game. It's one game I've been playing recently.

(01:42:37):
I've also been poking around Bluesky. Bluesky is interesting. I haven't gotten into a habit yet, but it's super interesting concept of empowering the community with these community-generated feeds. It's very different experience. But it's also interesting, there's a trade-off with the simplicity of the product and what you get with the additional complexity. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out, how it scales.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:05):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:43:10):
So there was this 1995 interview of Steve Jobs where he talks about this idea of there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product, and it sort of stuck with me over the years. And the simple way to think about that is it takes a lot of effort to make something special. And conversely, if it's easy, it's probably not that special or not that great. And it's something that I sort of think about when we build product, is there sufficient pain here where it's sort of a proxy for, are we creating something great, is interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:53):
Wow. It makes me think about founder mode a little bit. Like people talk about founder mode. The reason founder mode I think is important is the people that are most committed and passionate and driven to go through that pain and continue to make it... To take it from just an ugly baby idea to an awesome winning product oftentimes needs to be the founder. And that's why I think it's kind of emerged as a trend is it's important to have that drive, to just-

Chandra Janakiraman (01:43:54):
Surely. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:22):
... continue to refine it and not just like, "I had the idea, go build it now."

(01:44:27):
Okay, final question. You have an amazing background behind you. [inaudible 01:44:31] if people are on YouTube, it's just a beautiful book background, a bunch of objects and books. I'm curious if there's an object on there or a book on there that might be fun to highlight that you're especially into or proud of. And feel free to turn around if you want to look around. Curious if there's one thing that stands out, like, "Oh, here's this thing, [inaudible 01:44:48]."

Chandra Janakiraman (01:44:48):
Oh, well, it's the picture of my kids right in the center, which is without doubt the most important and memorable thing there. It's also caught it a unique time when they were incredibly... They were sort of super embracing each other and it's a phase where they've grown out of it. Now there's a lot more, I think rivalry and then sibling tussles. But that moment is my favorite.

(01:45:18):
I also have a bunch of fun stuff, like a big sort of Snoopy fan, and so it is... Also a big Beetles fan, so that picture is actually an interesting blend between Snoopy walking, crossing the road and then the Beetles crossing the other way. And then a bunch of books that are more memorable over the years. You'll see Creativity Inc there, you'll see The Ten Phases of Innovation, all of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:45):
Amazing. Thank you for sharing... Your kids' photo's blocked when you're in the center, so it's like a little Easter egg. Thank you for sharing that. Chandra, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. I think we're going to create that ripple that you were hoping for.

(01:45:57):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Chandra Janakiraman (01:46:02):
A reasonable choice would be LinkedIn to reach me, and I really, like you and I discussed earlier, I'd be really happy if this creates that kind of ripple effect of successes, both for individuals and for products. And I want everybody to think of this, the stuff I shared as a bit of an open source model. So test some of the concepts, modify it, remix it, and share what worked or did not. And ultimately, that's what makes it all interesting is the community owns it ultimately, and it doesn't belong to one individual. That's what would make me super happy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:44):
Amazing. Chandra, thank you so much for being here.

Chandra Janakiraman (01:46:48):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny, and thanks for your service to the product community.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Let's paint a picture of just what it was like to join Airbnb in your fifties.

Chip Conley (00:00:04):
I was mentoring Brian, but he was also my boss. I was 52, the average age was 26. I had to be both wise and curious, and often the dumbest person in the room.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
It's great to be in founder mode. It's not as great to be working for someone in founder mode.

Chip Conley (00:00:18):
Brian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration. His point of view is like, "Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock. Be there."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
Everyone's talking about, "We got to make the product better. We got to optimize this button, and improve conversion."

Chip Conley (00:00:32):
Isn't the product the homes and the apartments? Jobot said, "Nope. Product in the tech industry is something different." I just said, "Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
This whole story is a really good example of the value of having folks that are older.

Chip Conley (00:00:45):
When you have older brains connecting the dots, younger team members being really fast and focused, it's brilliant, and people won't notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
The Airbnb experienced led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy.

Chip Conley (00:00:59):
If you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. Midlife is not crisis. I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Well, let's back up a little bit, this near death experience. Today, my guest is Chip Conley. Chip is one of the most extraordinary and interesting people that you'll ever meet. He was a founding member of the board of Burning Nan. He was on the board of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. At 26, he started a hotel chain called Joie de Vivre, which went on to become the second-largest boutique hotel chain in the US.

(00:01:32):
After selling it, Brian Chesky personally recruited Chip to join Airbnb to help Brian and the company transform from a fast-growing startup to the world's most valuable hospitality brand. After leaving Airbnb where he was known as the Modern Elder, chip started the Modern Elder Academy, now known as MEA, the world's first midlife wisdom school, with large sprawling, beautiful campuses in Baja and Santa Fe. He's also written seven books, given a TED Talk, and is just a genuinely interesting and amazing human and friend.

(00:02:01):
In our conversation, we explore how to be successful in tech as you age, what he's learned working with and for Brian Chesky, including a lot of real talk, how to build a great culture at your company, his near-death experience, and how it changed the trajectory of his life, and so much more.

Chip Conley (00:04:38):
Oh, my god, Lenny, I sort of feel like I'm your father who's so proud of his son. My son has done so well, and I like to talk about, tell all my friends about you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):
Wow, I am honored. I'm happy that I'm making you proud, Chip, and I feel the same in reverse. We got to work together for many years at Airbnb. I got to learn a ton from you. I'm really excited that more people are going to get to learn from you from this conversation. I'm thinking that the way that we break up this conversation is kind of break it up into three parts, which are kind of the three arcs of your career. The three parts are your early career, building Joie de Vivre, your time at Airbnb, where we got to work together, and then talking through what you're working on now, the Modern Elder Academy.

(00:05:22):
I actually want to start with the middle chapter. I'm going to talk about Airbnb where we got to work together. Let's paint a picture of just what it was like for you to join Airbnb in your fifties surrounded by a bunch of 20 something, 30 somethings reporting to Brian Chesky, who is, I don't know, in his thirties. What was that like?

Chip Conley (00:05:41):
Yeah, I wasn't planning on doing this. I got a call from a woman named Natalie Tucci who worked at Airbnb, and said, "Brian Chesky and I've been talking about having you come in and give a talk. Are you open to that?" I was like, "Well, what is Airbnb?" This was 13 years ago, I think it was the end of 2012. Then Brian called me and said, "Listen, we really want you to come in." I came in and gave a talk about innovation and hospitality.

(00:06:14):
I think I didn't realize it was sort of a dress rehearsal for Brian to see whether the younger crowd there, I was 52, the average age was 26, would feel good about an old geezer like me with a bricks and mortar boutique hotel background, talking about the industry that Airbnb was disrupting. As it turns out, people liked me. Brian said, "I want you to come in and work 15 hours a week as a consultant. I want you to be my in-house mentor for both me, and Joe and Nate." I said, "Okay, 15 hours a week is great," and then within three weeks, it was 15 hours a day.

(00:07:00):
I was saying to Brian, "You're actually not paying me anything." He gave me a little bit of stock that would vest in six months and I said, "I don't know that this deal's working for me. It seems like the company needs to be a little more than you said." He said, "Yeah, I got you. I just wanted you to get in here and see what you could do." Long story short is I ended up going full-time. It was hard at first, Lenny, because I didn't understand the tech lingo. I didn't have any background. I was 52. I'd never worked in a tech company before.

(00:07:42):
I was mentoring Brian on leadership, but he was also my boss. I was the head of global hospitality and strategy, which meant initially, I was in charge of all the hosts in the world. Over time, that meant a lot more things too. I was involved in many parts of the business, definitely not the technical parts, but I think the hardest thing for me was just that initially, when people were talking about product, and Jobot said, "I'm the chief product officer," and I'm like, "Well, isn't the product the homes and the apartments?" Jobot said, "No, product in the tech industry is something different."

(00:08:23):
I had to be both wise and curious, and often the dumbest person in the room. It required me to have a certain amount of humility as well as to be reporting to a guy 21 years younger than me, Brian.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):
That actually, the point you're making there about what is the product I asked Laura Hughes, formerly Laura Modi, what to talk to you about, who we got to work together. She's the CEO of Bobbie now. You worked closely with her at Airbnb. She said this was the thing that stuck with her most about working with you is coming in and everyone's talking about, "We got to make the product better. We got to optimize this button and improve conversion, and product, product, product."

(00:08:59):
You're just like, "What is the product? I thought the product of Airbnb was the hosts, and the experiences, and the trips." I think that shows the value of someone like you coming in with different experience, and also older, and helping us communicate differently to hosts who also don't understand.

Chip Conley (00:09:15):
Well, there's an interesting thing also, Lenny, and you notice the difference in age between our hosts and our guests was probably about 10 years maybe. Over time, it actually got higher, because we started actually reaching out more aggressively to boomers and Gen Xers to be hosts. You had, I remember at one point, and again, let's get into a product talk here, I remember at one point, there was a conversation that was going on about taking Airbnb so it was mobile only.

(00:09:47):
Partly because back in the day, the two sharing economy darlings were Uber and Airbnb. Of course, Uber was pretty much a mobile only app. Airbnb started as non-mobile and then went mobile. Then it was like, "Oh, wouldn't it be interesting if everything was mobile?" At some point, I just said, "Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here to see how well they will be versed in managing their listing purely on mobile."

(00:10:18):
There were times where I was a voice for older users, in this case, hosts, that was helpful to guys and women in their twenties who were the engineers and designers and product managers. I always liked working with you. I want to just compliment Lenny for a minute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):
Oh, how sweet is that?

Chip Conley (00:10:41):
We did a lot of different things together, and what I appreciated was you had a humility to you that was different than a lot of the other product managers. There's other product managers, I'm not going to mention their names, and some of these product managers were very good. There were other product managers though who I found it sometimes hard to work with, because they expected me to know as much as they did.

(00:11:07):
I guess it would be, if the opposite side of that would be an older manager expecting a younger manager to have as much emotional intelligence, because emotional intelligence on average is something we get better at as we get older. I think the key for me to work in that environment and make it work was to not pretend to know things I didn't know, it was to have a sense of humor and humility in how I operated, and it was to show respect and hope that I got it in return. I don't know if you felt that way, Lenny. That's the kind of environment I tried to embody there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:45):
Absolutely. There's a couple of threads there I want to follow. One is just working for Brian. A lot of people talk about founder mode, and the power of founder mode, it's so great. That's how we-

Chip Conley (00:11:55):
Guess who-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
Exactly.

Chip Conley (00:11:57):
... populated that recently, that was Brian.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:01):
Exactly. It's great to be in founder mode. It's not as great to be working for someone in founder mode. Often a very challenging place to be.

Chip Conley (00:12:07):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
You reported to Brian. Also, you were just your own boss basically your entire career. You never really had to report to someone before. Also, he was in his thirties, you're in your fifties. What was it like working for Brian? The more real you can be, the better, because a lot of people always talk about here, it's like, "It was wonderful, I learned so much." Just like what was that experience? What did you learn from working for someone like Brian?

Chip Conley (00:12:30):
Well, let's start with the fact that I would never have gone to work for Airbnb if I didn't believe in Brian, because quite frankly, when Brian approached me and we started talking about it, I was like, I wasn't sure I liked the business model all that well as a hotelier. I had to believe in something beyond the business model, because I wasn't sure that the business model would work. Although soon after joining, I saw the numbers. I was like, "Wow, this is working pretty well."

(00:12:56):
I believed in Brian because the thing that Brian showed up with initially was just a curiosity and an appetite for learning. I remember back in 2011, when the big debacle happened with the apartment getting trashed by a guest. Brian decided he was going to go to find George Tenet, the former head of the CIA. Brian would go to experts and say to the expert, "I don't know what the hell I'm doing." He did that with me when it came to hospitality. I appreciated that a guy who had a lot of hubris, and Brian definitely has a lot of hubris, could also have the humility to say, "I want to learn more about this."

(00:13:42):
It's sort of a growth mindset. What was hard with Brian is, I'd say, three things. Number one is Brian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration, and he still has this issue. The beautiful thing about Brian is he's been very honest in the last couple of years on podcasts about his workaholism, and about the fact that the way he lives his life is not like other people. Back when I joined, his point of view is like, "Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock, be there."

(00:14:20):
It's like, "Really? No, I don't think so." I think the fact that Brian assumed everybody else was as one-dimensional in their focus as him was at times a problem, especially for a guy like me who was, I was in a stage in my career where I have a lot of interests. That was one. Number two is Brian admires and admired back then, Steve Jobs so much that there was a sense that as a guy who came from the product world, from the Rhode Island School of Design, he knew better than anybody else.

(00:15:05):
There was this, one of the challenges for a CEO sometimes, and this was my experience in my 24 years of running Joie de Vivre, my boutique hotel company, is it feels good when you feel needed. To come into a room and sort of see something, and then point out the things that are wrong makes you feel good. If you don't have emotional intelligence, that process can really piss people off or demotivate people. In Brian's case, I didn't have to deal with that too much, because he didn't understand, when I was starting, it was really, I was in charge of the hosts around the world.

(00:15:45):
Quite frankly, the idea of what's the psychology of the host? What's a host entrepreneur like? I went on a world tour to 20 different cities, and went and talked to hosts. I think I came back from that with a little bit of credibility with Brian to say like, "Hey, yes, our data science team and the quality folks who are doing qualitative interviews, they're getting something out of this." I actually went into the homes of these hosts all around the world, and I think I was lucky because Brian did less of that than he did with other people.

(00:16:19):
For the product team, my God, a product meeting with Brian would keep people up the night before, not just because they were actually working all night long to get prepared, but also they knew they would work all night long, because they probably wouldn't sleep in anticipation for this. That was another issue, I'd say. I'd say the other thing that, and in each of these cases, I think Brian's getting better. Just like Steve Jobs got better over time when he left and then he came back, he was much better when he came back, from all the people I've talked with who worked with him.

(00:16:53):
I'd say the third thing for Brian was the sense that adding a zero to something in terms of expectations, or thinking you're going to set a deadline that is unreasonable is necessary. If you don't do that, there's almost an underlying message that people won't kick ass on their own. There was a sense that Brian had that he had to maybe create ridiculous goals, because even if we hit half of that goal, it was very encouraging. What he missed in that was the fact that when you miss a goal, and when you have someone who has power over you setting the goal, or encouraging a particular goal, you're setting people up for a lot of stress.

(00:17:51):
At the end of the day, I think Brian is a generational leader as a millennial, and I think he deserves a lot of credit. Airbnb is as successful as it is, partly because of Brian's leadership. I would not have been there without him. Having said that, I had to hold my tongue in meetings sometimes when I saw how he was operating, because I wouldn't have done it that way. I think over time, I hope I had a little bit of influence on him in terms of how to apply some emotional intelligence to leading people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):
For people in this position, a lot of people work for founders, especially now that founder mode is a thing. Every founder is just like, "I'm the founder, you got to do what I tell you. It's founder mode. Again, this is how we win. We're in founder mode." You shared really good insight of building credibility as a really good lever to work better with someone like that. Is there anything else you just think as tactics to be effective with founders in founder mode?

Chip Conley (00:18:53):
Knowing what I know now, I would say, "Lenny, let's do a little pep talk, you and me before the meeting." I want you to start the meeting with the following as you present and Brian's in the room. "Brian, let's talk about what we're trying to accomplish here. Let's get really clear," and you probably did this, but, "let's get really clear on what both, what's the intention of this iteration that we're doing on the product? What defines success, and what do I want to get accomplished in this meeting?"

(00:19:25):
You start with that, because that actually helps to make sure there's alignment. Frankly, if there's not alignment, you might as well not have the meeting. Let's spend the rest of this meeting talking about alignment. That's what I would do, because that's something you can come back to over and over again during the rest of the meeting when Brian or the founder, whomever it is, is beating you up on something, saying like, "Well, let me tell you why it looks like that or why we're doing that." It goes back to that, the three principles or the three key goals we're trying to do with this product update. Yeah, so try to set alignment on the front end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:06):
That's an important tip for anyone working with anyone, even. I love just that that works especially well here. Then just going back to the credibility piece, what you shared there is you went on this world tour, not something everyone can do, but just getting really close to your customers, and using that as a, "Hey, I actually know what I'm talking about. You actually should listen to me even though you're the founder."

Chip Conley (00:20:27):
Yeah, I think the other thing is PowerPoint or whatever tool you're using, just be careful about being overly reliant upon it, especially when you have a combustible founder who may take you off path, such that your deck in its current order makes no sense at all. I always wanted to really limit the deck as much as possible, because I didn't know where the meeting was going to go. I wanted the decks helpful at the start, at the very start, to just set principles, set goals. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):
This whole story of you joining Airbnb in your fifties is a really good example of intergenerational collaboration, something that you're big on, just the value of having folks that are older working at tech companies. Maybe just talk about that broadly, and then we segue into other elements of your career.

Chip Conley (00:21:28):
I wrote a book called Wisdom at Work: the Making of a Modern Elder after my Airbnb experience. I did a lot of research. I was like, "Wow, so why do we have less intergenerational collaboration in the workplace, especially in Silicon Valley than we could use?" I started interviewing people, then I started talking to brain scientists, neuroscientists, and realized that a younger brain has fluid intelligence, tends to be fast and focused, really good at problem solving, very good at linearity in terms of looking at things.

(00:21:59):
As you get older, the brain shrinks a little bit and you have crystallized intelligence. In crystallized intelligence, what's going on is you're going from left brain to right brain more adeptly. There's a little bit less focus, a little more holistic thinking, systemic thinking, connecting the dots. You can imagine that on a team when you have older brains connecting the dots, thinking broadly, peripherally, younger team members being really fast and focused, and being able to think linearly how to get things done, that combination can either be successful or not.

(00:22:36):
When it's successful. It's brilliant. I think Laura, Laura Modi, Laura Hughes Modi, who was my director of hospitality, but also we worked in so many different capacities with her in the company, I loved working with her because her brain worked different than my brain. That's the opportunity is when you realize that diversity on a team, there's lots of kinds of diversity, but when it comes to brain diversity, not just with neuro diverse people but age diverse people, you get a benefit, an effective benefit that is not as noticeable, quite frankly, in some other diversities.

(00:23:16):
I found that over and over was really helpful. Part of my job sometimes was to find the blind spot. Again, if you are very focused, one of the things I said to Brian early on was, "I've seen the business plan. Now, I know the goals of how big we want to be in three years." This was very early in my tenure. I said, "But what we really have done, everything we're trying to do is to have no regulations and pay no occupancy tax." Now, hotels pay a bed tax, occupancy tax, we're not paying it, and we're trying to do everything we can not to pay it.

(00:23:51):
Knowing that, so for our listeners and viewers to know this, this is something that a guest pays. It's not the host who pays it, the guest pays it. It's part of the bill. If you go and stay in a hotel, there's a big, big tax part of the bill, but it made us more affordable by not having to have our guests pay taxes. Long story short is I said to Brian, "If we're as big as we're going to be three years from now, I promise you we're going to be regulated. I promise you we're going to be paying occupancy taxes. Let's take some proactive steps toward building a strategy for how we're going to be regulated."

(00:24:28):
That has consistently been Airbnb's biggest challenge is regulation in municipal markets all around the world. If we'd started a little earlier, maybe in New York, maybe in New York, it wouldn't have gotten to the point where it has been toxic in New York for the last dozen years ever since I was there. There's a few other markets in the world where it was like that. I would just say the value in having some age diversity, even when you have an older person reporting to a younger person, is it can be collaborative.

(00:25:02):
There was a guy named John Q. Smith, an engineer who I think you probably remember him at Airbnb. This is a guy who looked younger than he was, and he was a little bit nervous about telling people his age. The thing that was great about John is over time, he was not necessarily going to be the best coder at Airbnb. There was a whole new collection of coders coming in every month, but he became a great manager.

(00:25:32):
The beautiful thing about moving from the individual contributor to the manager, the person who can actually bring out the best in a bunch of younger people, who may be better technically than he or she is, but they know how to elevate talent. I call this invisible productivity. It's productivity in which you make everybody else around you better. That's something I tried to do with my teams at Airbnb. Ultimately, I had six different teams, five hospitality and five other teams reporting to me. I did my best to just be the kind of person who wasn't solving all the problems, but I was trying to elevate.

(00:26:11):
There's a woman named Lisa Dubost who is at Airbnb, and she, one day, the HR department was reporting to me at one point, and she was running HR. She was 25 and had no background in HR at all. One day she came in to me and she just said, "Chip, you are my confidant." Lisa has a French accent and fluent in French. She said confidant in just the right way. I said, "Oh, well thank you, Lisa." I said to her, "You haven't given me any juicy details yet. A confidant is someone who has the secrets."

(00:26:42):
She said to me, "No, in my part of France, a confidant is somebody who gives you confidence." It was like, "Oh, well, maybe that's what a mentor can be is a confidant, someone who gives you confidence and helps by asking questions, helps you as the younger mentee find your roadmap to success."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):
You're sharing a lot of really good examples of the value of older folks being within tech companies. Let me just ask you this, how real is ageism in tech? I ask because a lot of people that are hiring are probably thinking, no, no, I'm not biased. I'm going to hire the best person. If they're someone in their fifties, I'll hire them. No problem. It doesn't feel like it actually works out that way often. Just how real of a problem is this? What do you see?

Chip Conley (00:27:27):
Yeah, it's clearly a problem. I'd say it's maybe a little bit less of a problem than it was a dozen years ago, because I think a dozen years ago, it was almost a blind spot. In Airbnb, we had a group called Wisdom at Airbnb. It was an employee resource group for people 40 and older. There are lots of these kinds of groups that didn't exist a dozen years ago in all kinds of tech companies, which is good, because it means that there's a voice and a way to congregate with a bunch of people who are older.

(00:28:00):
Ultimately, we had these senior nomads come in and be like the voice of the customer for 10 weeks at Airbnb. It was the Wisdom at Airbnb older employee group that really actually pushed for this with Brian. The challenge is, in a world in which the smartest new people, especially when it comes to technical skills and engineering, are coming in with a whole new set of skills that an older person doesn't have, the older person is both expensive and may be perceived as slow. In the era of AI, it's a whole new ballgame.

(00:28:42):
The question, I think, will be if what AI cannot do is the human wisdom piece, artificial intelligence and human wisdom might be the balance beams here. Is it possible that older managers who have a little more emotional intelligence, a little more pattern recognition, a little bit more wisdom, can be a value to a company? The jury's still out. There's a New York Times article that just came out about the question of is AI going to wipe out older people's jobs or younger people's jobs? I think the answer is both, but the question is how bad is it for both of them?

(00:29:29):
I think what I would say to an older person, and when I say older, I mean like 45 or older, if you've done well financially and you're doing okay, the question you might ask yourself is, are you open, as I ultimately was with Brian in my fourth year at Airbnb? I took a substantial pay cut. I think it went down to 40% or 50% time, and my stock, my options were dropped to that level, my salaries dropped to that level, because I didn't want to work full time anymore. There are a lot of people who can be valuable in a company who have some institutional wisdom, some process knowledge of how to get things done in this organization.

(00:30:08):
In tech companies, that's really important. Airbnb, one of the biggest challenges that Airbnb has always been, how do I get shit done around here? Process knowledge allows you to understand, how do you deal with an org chart and get things done partly because you understand the motivations of different groups? That is something you build over time. Long story short is I just think that older people might look at their workload and say, "I'm willing to take a 20% or a 40% pay cut to go to 80% or 60% time," and the company is going to get their money's worth in that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):
That's a really interesting point, that if you're older and you're maybe less connected to the most cutting edge ways of building and coding, AI makes that a lot easier in many ways where you start to just talk to it. You don't even need to understand what's happening underneath.

Chip Conley (00:31:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):
There's a lot of listeners who are older in tech, there's a lot of listeners who are approaching midlife, let's say, worried about what happens to their career. When you look at people you've worked with and had at your academy, which we'll talk about, who continue to thrive and continue to have a really healthy career in tech, what do they do differently? What do they have in common that other folks you think should work on and focus on?

Chip Conley (00:31:28):
I think this idea being a mentor and a mentor and an intern, there's just the voracious appetite for curiosity. When I talk to someone who's a midlife and wants to be in the tech world or already is, the thing I say is, "Show up with curiosity and a passionate engagement for what you do, and people won't necessarily notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy." Energy has two parts to it. Energy is, they notice that you are not just sort of resting on your laurels, you have physical energy in how you do your job.

(00:32:04):
When people are like that, they're sort of timeless. They're age fluid, as I say. We talk about gender fluidity. Well, there could be age fluidity. They're not defined by their age. The other part of energy that's important is being positive. That's sort of more energetic, a little bit more California energetic. There's a sense of when someone's got good energy, you're drawn to them. It's about showing up with the kind of energy of someone 10 or 20 years younger than you, and then showing up with positive energy.

(00:32:38):
I think one of the things that would say I did well at, there's lots of things I didn't do well at Airbnb, but in terms of what I did well is I was very approachable. Over the course of time, the number of mentees I had, the number of people who just wanted to have coffee with me or tea, the number of people who just said, "Thank you for being in that meeting, you just sort of gave it a positive feeling," was really important.

(00:33:04):
My energy, both the positive energy part, and then also the fact that yeah, I could work 60 and 70 hours a week, and I could travel around the world as the Secretary of State of the company, which is what Brian called me a couple times on stage. The fact that I could do that meant that no one was looking at me and saying, "Let's get rid of the old fogey." Well, maybe some people the board, but I wasn't aware of them. I just think show up with that passionate engagement, that curiosity, that energy, the ability to be both the learner and the teacher, with respect for people that are younger than you, and you're going to probably do pretty well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):

(00:35:03):
Interestingly, curiosity comes up a lot when I ask AI-forward people, what are they focusing on helping their kids learn most? Curiosity is the most common way to describe. At every stage of life, curiosity is something to cultivate. I want to go to the flip side of companies looking to hire. It feels like there's this untapped supply of awesome people that companies with ageism and tech aren't finding and hiring. To help hiring managers and companies take advantage of this, what's something you suggest they do? How do they shift their mindset or maybe shift the way they hire that might help them find these people?

Chip Conley (00:35:39):
I think we're moving into, there's a book that David Epstein wrote called Range, and the whole premise of range is that we are moving out of the era of the specialists and into the era of the generalists. I think AI is just accelerating this. As we are more reliant upon AI, and AI can be exceptional at technical skills and solutions really expeditiously, I think generalists, people who can think broadly, become all the more important. I think that what I would say to someone in HR or recruiting is beyond what I already said before, is the person passionate?

(00:36:23):
Are they curious? Are they a learner? Do they have good energy? I would also say, are they a generalist when they're a problem solver? I actually think that's going to be an increasingly important part of how effective companies think broadly. I think that's a key one. I think also, this idea of how do you create intergenerational collaboration in the form of mutual mentorships? One of the things I loved at Airbnb, there were a few people I did this with, where I had something to teach them and they had something to teach me.

(00:37:02):
A good example, my iPhone, so there's 97% of the utility of my iPhone that I probably don't use and don't know how to use. This was back in, let's say, 2013, 2014. There were people who knew iPhone or Google Suites back then. I'd never used a Google Doc back then when I joined Airbnb. There were people who could teach me something technical, and then they wanted to learn something from me, which would be like, "How do you want a great meeting," or, "How do you give a great employee review?" There are a lot of managers who've never been a manager before.

(00:37:45):
How do you disperse people like me in the organization so that there's usually not enough time for these young managers to come to some training session on how to do a good employee review. You sort of have to do it out there in the field. It's like apprenticeship back in the trades. You're an electrician apprentice, not because you're watching some video on it, you're out there in the field, doing it. That's a huge value in a younger company when you have some older people who have not been vested with the responsibility of managing those younger people.

(00:38:23):
They may actually be reporting to someone younger than them, but they're there to actually be support. In some ways, I think that was part of the unexpected value that I was able to offer to Airbnb and to Brian specifically, because there are a ton of people in Airbnb who were not even in my departments who would come to me and say, "I'm having a problem. How do I solve this? Can we spend lunch together?" I almost always said yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
I think the reason people did that in many ways is you just have a very unique aura of wisdom, and it's hard to replicate that, Chip.

Chip Conley (00:39:04):
Yes, and it all comes back to the curiosity. If I was just the older elder, dispensing wisdom, people would've gotten bored very quickly. I think the fact, yeah, I was on the board of Burning Man, that's cool. I show up as someone who feels younger than I am. I'm turning 65 this year. The bottom line is I think people lost track of my age, partly because I lost track of my age.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:38):
That's such good advice on the front end to be successful as a person kind of getting older in tech is curiosity, positive energy, the way you talked about it, passionate, engagement, is that the term?

Chip Conley (00:39:52):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:53):
Then on the other side is hire generalists. This actually comes up a lot in the AI conversations, just exactly as you said, the power of generalists reminds me, I'm going to this gym now, and the lady there is just like, "I love AI so much, because I'm just such a big picture person, and I am so bad at just getting, thinking about the details, and AI solves all that for me." It's like, "Here, here's what I want to do. I'll do this, move my house to here, here." It's like, "Here's what you need to do, step one, two, three, four, five."

Chip Conley (00:40:18):
It is remarkable. Since the time I've known you, how fast it has become dominant in our lives. Yeah, I think one of the last thing I'd say is, look, I'm privileged. For those of you who are listening or watching this and you're saying, "Well, Chip, you were 52 years old and they came to you. That doesn't happen to me. I'm not in that position." The thing I would say is, you're right, but I could have been plucked and brought in and partly as Brian's boy, people would've rejected me, because if I didn't show up the right way, it wouldn't have worked well.

(00:41:00):
There are lots of people who Brian brought into the company who didn't work well. I think the key is how do you get the foot in the door? At the end of the day, those second and third order of degrees of separation in terms of networking are still essential. The most important thing is to be able to articulate what you have accomplished in a new way that a recruiter says, "Wow." I really tell people I would love to see a resume.

(00:41:41):
First of all, the question that I think it was, who was it? Someone asked it, I don't remember if it was Cheryl Stamberg or someone else asked her, who said, "What's the biggest problem you're dealing with here, and how can I help you?" That's a great line. Number two is what I love to see is not so much what roles you've had, what bullet points do you have of your things you've learned? Give me, in a paragraph, a thorny problem you faced. What was the problem, and what skills you used to actually accomplish it, and what was the result of that?

(00:42:22):
I would love to see a resume like that. The older you are, the more you can actually have a resume like that. Then you can use that as the conversation piece when you're doing interviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):
I love that. I love that we're getting into interview advice and resume advice.

Chip Conley (00:42:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:38):
Speaking of thorny problems, and also why Brian decided to reach out to you, I want to go back to the beginning of your career.

Chip Conley (00:42:45):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):
Right out of business-

Chip Conley (00:42:47):
You're good at this, by the way. You're good at this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:49):
I was thinking ahead. Okay, so you're in business school, you left business school, you're like, "Maybe I should start a hotel." Something that rarely works out usually probably leads to a lot of money lost and a lot of frustration and just like, "Okay, what have I done with my life?" Worked out for you.

(00:43:07):
Ended up building the second largest boutique hotel chain in the world, Joie de Vivre, beloved. I loved every single experience I've had as Joie de Vivre. When you sold it, I was like, "That is so sad." Talk about just that story. I know this could go on for hours, but what's the-

Chip Conley (00:43:21):
Yeah, I'll be brief.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:22):
Yeah.

Chip Conley (00:43:23):
26 years old, couple of years out of Stanford Business School, working for a commercial real estate developer. I was bored silly. I wanted to do something more creative. Bill Graham, famous concert promoter, said to me, because I had gotten to know him, "What San Francisco really needs is a rock and roll hotel." I decided to start looking to find a broken down motel hotel that I could turn into a rock and roll hotel.

(00:43:46):
I found something in the Tenderloin, and turned it into the Phoenix, which became a famous rock and roll hotel that I have owned for 39 years now. Long story short is that was how I started Joie de Vivre, the company. We grew to 52 hotels around California, became the second largest, as you said, in the world in terms of the number of hotels, boutique hotels that we operated. I loved it till I hated it. In my late forties, I hated it, didn't want to do it anymore. The great recession came along and it was just kicking my ass.

(00:44:23):
I really went through a bit of what I now call a midlife chrysalis, but a midlife crisis, where I just wanted to change everything. I got through it. I had an NDE, I had a near-death experience where I had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic and I died. From that point forward, I realized every day is a gift and a bonus, and I decided to sell my company at the bottom of the great recession. That's really how I created this space in my life to be able to join Airbnb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):
Well, let's back up a little bit. This near-death experience, share more there. What happened there?

Chip Conley (00:45:04):
Yeah, so I write books. I've written seven or eight books, and I had written a book called Peak: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow. It was a book that Brian really liked, and part of the reason he wanted to reach out to me. I was on a book tour, I had a broken ankle. I broke my ankle at a bachelor party playing baseball. I ended up with a cut on my leg and the cut on my leg had fertilizer in it and went septic. I was on a very strong antibiotic and I died.

(00:45:39):
I went flatlined from the allergic reaction to the antibiotic. I saw, it happened nine times over 90 minutes, I kept dying, kept flatlining, yeah. Ended up in the hospital for three days. They finally said, "Listen, it's an allergic reaction, we believe." They thought it was a heart attack, a bunch of stuff, stroke, et cetera. No, it was the allergic reaction. I saw birds. I saw all this beautiful stuff. We don't have time to go into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):
You did? What?

Chip Conley (00:46:11):
I did. You want to hear this? Yeah, I saw this beautiful stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:13):
Let's do it.

Chip Conley (00:46:15):
I think there's a hotel in San Francisco called the Vitale that I built across the street from the ferry building, and it's still there, but it's no longer called the Vitale. In that hotel, there were these slippers in every guest room. One slipper said slow, the other slipper said down. I was wearing these slippers in my flatline thing, flying in the air in a 40-foot tall living room in the Alps, surrounded by birds that were tweeting and chirping at me.

(00:46:50):
I understood bird talk. I understand exactly what they were saying. They kept telling me, "If you slow down, you will see beauty and you will see awe." There was a bunch of other things, but let me just limit it to that and just say, and then the birds would say, "It's time to go." The birds would go out the big window into the mountains, and I would try to follow them. Right as I would get to the window, all of a sudden, I'd come back to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:20):
Holy shit. I love that there was a message inside of this experience. I don't know how many people experienced that. Clearly, this led to a big life change. It's interesting that a lot of times, you need something like that. You've been doing this for how many years at that point? Running Joie de Vivre?

Chip Conley (00:47:38):
At that point, I'd been running Joie de Vivre for 22 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):
22 years. It's interesting that you need something like that a lot of times. Otherwise, it just momentum just keeps carrying you forward.

Chip Conley (00:47:46):
Within two years, I'd sold it, and I had the chance to move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):
With building Joie de Vivre, something you've written about a number of times is just the way you built it is a really unique approach to building a business. Specifically, there's a huge focus on culture, which also came out at Airbnb. Talk about just why you see culture as such an important part of how you build a business like tangibly. A lot of people talk about culture, warm, fuzzy stuff, but you think about it very tangibly.

Chip Conley (00:48:15):
Culture is what happens around here when the boss is not around. The more distributed a company, the more culture is important. The boss is around in a traditional bricks and mortar workplace where everybody shows up at eight and leaves at six, and we all see each other. In my company, in Joie de Vivre, we had 52 hotels, and 25 restaurants, and four spas, and it was distributed. I couldn't be in all those places all the time.

(00:48:52):
Similarly, with Airbnb, Airbnb had offices around the world and it was a global company. The more distributed you are, of course, in the remote work world we live in, the more culture is important, and more difficult. When you're remote, there's these few cues you have about how we do things around here. They're usually in a digital, virtual format, which is why it's all the more important for you to have in-person gatherings of a team more often if you are virtual.

(00:49:27):
At the end of the day, the reason the culture is important is because it actually helps, it helps guide people in terms of making decisions, but it's also a magnet for the right kind of people. Oracle has a different culture than Apple, which has a different culture than Facebook. You can choose the place you're going to work based upon the culture. There are people who can be very good at what they do, but if they're in the wrong culture, they're in the wrong kind of environment, and they're not willing to shift to fit that culture.

(00:50:01):
We saw it at Airbnb all over and over again. In fact, Airbnb saw it, I think when with Amazon people. Apple people have resonated pretty well at Airbnb, Amazon people, less so. Those are two different cultures, Amazon and Apple. Therefore, understanding a culture before you even actually take the job is one of the more important decisions you need to make is like, "Is this culture a culture that I can live with and maybe influence?" There's language about culture fit.

(00:50:37):
I like to say culture add, because culture fit to me can actually be quite negative toward somebody who is the aberration. You have to fit in. Especially if this is a demographic thing, a person of color, a gay person, a person in a wheelchair, so you have to fit in. A culture add suggests that actually having some diversity on the team is helpful, because it actually adds to the culture. You still have to be able to get along in that culture. Culture is an intangible. That's the problem with it is it's hard to measure, but you see its value and you understand whether it's working based upon employee pulse reports and things like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):
You talk about having to understand the culture is such a key part of having success at a company. Do you have any advice for just how to understand the culture for someone interviewing? I don't know. You came in, you work part-time, it's easier to experience it all. Any tips there for, "Okay, this is for me, it's not for me?"

Chip Conley (00:51:39):
When you're interviewing, you're also interviewing them. When you're interviewing, it's not about you having to prove yourself. It's also for them to actually prove themselves as a company, and also try to understand if there is some alignment in the company. The kind of questions I would ask as someone who's being interviewed would be, what are three to five adjectives that define this culture? What's the biggest problem in this culture, in terms of something that's just endemic or baked in across the organization?

(00:52:14):
Is it ever going to get fixed? How could I come in and maybe help that? Which frankly, at a very junior level, you're not going to be able to help it except for in very minor ways. If you're a senior person, you might be able to help it. Those are the kind of questions I'd want to know. Frankly, if I'm asking that same question about what are the adjectives to multiple people, am I hearing the same thing over and over again? If I'm not, is that because there's not alignment? Is that because different departments have different flavors?

(00:52:48):
You could have a culture within a department that's very different than the overall corporate culture. The corporate culture certainly has an enormous oppressive influence, but you can be in a culture, a really great culture of a team or a department, in an overall company culture that's not good. In the long run, that oppressive company culture is either going to have to evolv,e or your department, you may lose people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:23):
When I reflect back on the impact you had at Airbnb, one of the funny things I think about is triangles showing up a lot on decks, and specifically rooted in Maslow's hierarchy, just like everything's this Maslow hierarchy metaphor.

Chip Conley (00:53:41):
True.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):
This one, I don't know, specific piece of this is you have this kind of model you think about for how to help employees be successful at a company. It's kind of rooted in your Peak book philosophy. Maybe just talk about that, and then if there's anything else you want to expand on with this power of thinking through the Maslow hierarchy.

Chip Conley (00:54:01):
Maslow's hierarchy, basically five levels. Later in life, he had a seven and an eight level model, but at the base is the kind of physical, water, food, air, and you move up to self-actualization at the top. To use this model as a hierarchy of needs for employees, customers, and investors is what the Peak model is about. The Peak, my book. The employee model is really simple. It's money or compensation at the base, recognition in the middle, and meaning at the top.

(00:54:39):
Now, there are some industries and some kinds of jobs in which money is 90% of the pyramid. Just because of the base doesn't mean it's not the dominant part of the pyramid, but the differentiation often is in recognition and meaning. In nonprofits, usually the money piece of it's rather thin. The recognition's this, and meaning's huge. Understanding how do you create an organization, and I gave a TED Talk in 2010 about this topic as well, how do you measure the intangibles of meaning and how do you create an environment where people feel a sense of meaning?

(00:55:18):
The customer pyramid, briefly, I'll just say that one, is meeting expectations is the base, meeting desires is in the middle, and then meeting unrecognized needs. I think one of the things that we did at Airbnb about a year after I joined, and when Jonathan Goldenhall was joining, is we really tried to ask ourselves, "Are we in the home sharing business, or are we in some kind of business that is even bigger and broader than that?" Ultimately, we came up with the idea that we were in the belong anywhere business.

(00:55:49):
Airbnb was not in home sharing, we were in belonging anywhere. Once you have that down, that was sort of the unrecognized need at the top of the pyramid. Then that becomes an organizing principle for how do you teach your hosts to create a sense of belonging? How does our marketing and advertising play up the belonging piece, especially and the everywhere piece, because hotels are not everywhere, but homes are? I would just say that this model, the idea of hierarchies is, I think, very helpful. Yeah, my book Peak has been around for 18 years, but I still am asked to give 20 or 30 speeches a year on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:30):
Oh, man. This pyramid of comp, recognition, meaning is really interesting, especially these days, because with all this AI researcher poaching, there's all this talk of just like, "Will people just go work wherever they get the most money, or is there a mission and meaning to the work they're doing that will keep them not taking a hundred million dollars offer?" Seems to be happening in a lot of cases, which shows you the power of meaning.

Chip Conley (00:56:55):
Yeah. If you know you're working for a toxic company, at some point, your conscience kicks in. Whether it's toxic in terms of the purpose of the company, toxic in terms of the leadership or the culture, life is too short.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:10):
Okay. You've had two major shifts in your career. You started the hotel chain, then you went to Airbnb. Most recently, the Airbnb experience, I imagine, led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy. Talk about what is the Modern Elder Academy?

Chip Conley (00:57:28):
Yeah, what is going on with that Modern Elder Academy? The Modern Elder Academy. There was a couple times where I was called the Modern Elder at Airbnb, and then I was told that a Modern Elder is someone who's as curious as they are wise. Jonathan Mildenhall, who is the chief marketing officer at Airbnb, used to call me the Modern Elder as well, and he said, "If you ever create a school, Modern Elder would be a good name."

(00:57:56):
We talked about it, and next thing I knew, I was saying, "Okay, this is called the Modern Elder Academy." We now call it MEA because elder is a fraught word on some level, it makes you sound elderly. What I really wanted to create was a place where people could come and do a workshop, they're five day workshops in Baja on the beach, or in Santa Fe on a big four square mile horse ranch, and reimagine and repurpose yourself, and navigate transitions.

(00:58:27):
We go through so many transitions in the middle of our life, let's say between, I define midlife as 35 to 75, guys. It's a very long life stage. We go through a lot of transitions. We are constantly evolving our purpose. We're building our wisdom. We have knowledge management tools out there, but we're the wisdom management tools. We're the tools that help us to get wiser over time, and then we need to reframe our relationship with getting older. Becca Levy has shown at Yale that when you shift your mindset on aging from a negative to a positive, you get seven and a half years of additional life, which is more life than any other biohack that's being done right now.

(00:59:08):
That's what we do, and we have 7,000 grads from 60 countries, and 56 regional chapters around the world. It's a bit of a movement, and I teach. I teach some of the workshops, and we have all kinds of famous people who come and teach. For me, creating the world's first midlife wisdom school just feels like the natural next thing for me to do. I love hospitality, so it's a very upscale kind of experience, but we have scholarships. I love retreat centers. I was on the board of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur for 10 years. I love wellness.

(00:59:45):
I've owned the Kabuki Springs and Spa for 28 years, which is the largest spa in San Francisco, and I love education. My book, Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder, gave me a curriculum in which we've expanded quite a bit with Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and UC, Berkeley professors helping us create a curriculum around midlife. That's how MEA came about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:14):
To your point, I forget who said, I think you said Jonathan has said this was a natural next step for you, I completely agree. It's like, looking back, this is the obvious thing you should be doing right now.

Chip Conley (01:00:22):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):
Also, I'm learning more things about you. I didn't know you were involved with the Kabuki Spa. I think Esalen and I knew, you just keep getting more interested.

Chip Conley (01:00:31):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:32):
There's a couple threads here I want to actually follow. This point you made about shifting your mindset to aging as a positive thing helps you live longer. That's such a powerful point. Can you just speak more to that, just what does that look like?

Chip Conley (01:00:43):
Yeah, there's lots of data points. I'll talk about two. One is this Becca Levy study, which has been going on for 15 to 20 years. If you sort of buy into the ageism of American society or Hallmark cards, when you get a card at age 40, 50, or beyond, there's a belief that life gets worse as you get older. If you can survive your midlife crisis, all you have to look forward to is disease, decrepitude, and death. The bottom line is there's a lot of things that get better with age. I wrote a book called Learning to Love Midlife.

(01:01:20):
The subtitle says it all: 12 Reasons Why Life Gets Better with Age. What I really wanted to do with that book, which is really, it summarizes the MEA curriculum, I wanted to write a book that sort of helped people to see the upside of aging, the unexpected pleasures of aging. They had a pro-aging, not just an anti-aging point of view. When you actually have a pro-aging point of view and you see the upside of aging, you take better care of yourself, both your mind and your body. You actually are willing to learn and try new things.

(01:01:51):
One of my favorite MEA questions is, 10 years from now, what will you regret if you don't learn it or do it now? It's a powerful question, really important question as we get older. When you're young, you've got all of your life left ahead of you. When I moved to Baja part-time in Mexico at age 56, I had a mindset which was, "I'm too old to learn Spanish. I'm too old to learn to surf," but when I said, "10 years from now, what will I regret if I don't learn it or it now?" I said, "Well, 10 years from now, I might still be living in Baja. I should learn Spanish, I should learn how to surf because we're right next to a surf break."

(01:02:29):
I did. What I believe is that anticipated regret is a form of wisdom, and it's a catalyst for taking action. That's one data point. The other data point is something called the U-curve of happiness, and it's been around for 20 years, and it shows the following. It has changed in the last couple of years because young adults are unhappy like never before. A 20 or a 22-year-old, really unhappy, 24-year-old, really unhappy.

(01:02:58):
Historically, the way it was is you were happy from 18 to 23 or 24, and then around 23 or 24, you start to see a long, slow decline in life satisfaction that actually bottoms out between 45 and 50. I'm sorry to tell you that, Lenny, since you're 44, but your mileage may vary.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):
You're saying I'm the least happy I'll ever be. That's only upside. That's great. Yeah.

Chip Conley (01:03:21):
Well, here's the part that's weird is that before this research was done, and it's global research across all demographics, what they found was starting around age 50 or 52, you get happier, so that you're happier in your fifties than your forties, sixties, fifties, seventies, happier than sixties, and the women in their eighties, happier than seventies. Wow. It's partly because we are in around 45 to 50, doing this thing called the midlife unraveling, what Brené Brown calls the midlife unraveling.

(01:03:55):
You're unraveling your expectations, what you define as success, your definition of what a beautiful body looks like, and you're liberated into freedom in your fifties and beyond. I can say that, yeah, I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience, and not wanting to run my company anymore.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):
You used this term earlier, the midlife chrysalis, was that what it was?

Chip Conley (01:04:22):
Chrysalis. Chrysalis, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:23):
Chrysalis. What is that? Is that kind of along the same lines?

Chip Conley (01:04:27):
If you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. It's that cocoon in which all of the change is happening. At the time, when you're going through it, it's like, "Oh, shit. My life is liquefying in front of myself." On the other side of it, there's a metamorphosis that happens.

(01:04:48):
I like to use the language, in fact, I have a podcast called The Midlife Chrysalis, because I want to help change the dialogue around midlife, so that the number one word attached to midlife is not crisis, but in fact, it's maybe chrysalis, and the idea that life is meant to be transformative during that era.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:09):
That is actually very empowering. I am sort of going through that, not necessarily in this intense way yet, but that might be coming. You said there's a bunch of upsides to getting older. It might be helpful just to share a couple of those things for folks that are like, "Oh, wow, I didn't realize that."

Chip Conley (01:05:23):
Emotional intelligence grows with age. Our wisdom can grow with age, although we know 70-year-olds who are not as wise as 30-year-olds, so it's a matter of what you do with your life experience. I define wisdom as metabolized experience, mindfully shared for the common good. What else gets better with age? You learn how to edit. You have no more Fs left to give, no more fucks left to give. That is absolutely true, especially for women as they age. You are more spiritually curious. The list is long, and so there are a lot of things that, actually, another one that I love is you're not compartmentalized.

(01:06:01):
When you're younger, you're compartmentalized. As you grow older, you are growing whole, and that means you're alchemizing curiosity and wisdom, introvert, extrovert, masculine, feminine, gravitas, depth, and levity, lightness. The people who I really admire who are 85 years old, they're so present and they're so whole. They are just who they are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):
There's a quote I found from you along these lines, the societal narrative on aging is just don't do it.

Chip Conley (01:06:31):
Fantastic. Yeah. We sort of say we don't want to age, but we do want to live. Quite frankly, aging and living are the same thing, as are aging and growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:44):
Coming back to MEA, just for folks that are interested, curious about this, who's this for, would you say? Who should seriously look into this program?

Chip Conley (01:06:52):
MEA is really, the people who tend to come to MEA are in the midst of a transition. It could be selling their company, leaving a job, getting divorced, having kids, becoming an empty nester, taking care of parents till they're passing away, having a health diagnosis that's scary. Average age is 54, and it's people of all walks of life. It's not just the tech industry, but it's very popular in the tech industry. It's people who are looking to maybe do a reframe of their purpose, and maybe even a reinvention of their career.

(01:07:29):
Yeah, the two campuses are just gorgeous. It's been called the Four Seasons meets Blue Zones meets the Esalen Institute, which I like. We have online programs too, and so you don't have to come to either of our campuses in Mexico, or on the beach, or in New Mexico. You can actually do it online.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:54):
Those three, yeah, that's the tagline. That's your tagline right there. Esalen meets Blue Zones, meets what was the first one?

Chip Conley (01:08:00):
The Four Seasons.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):
The Four Seasons.

Chip Conley (01:08:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:03):
Nailed it. Okay. I'm going to zoom out and take us to a recurring segment on this podcast. I want to see if this goes anywhere, AI Corner, and with AI Corner, ask guests, what's a way that you've found AI useful in your work or in your life, any kind of trick you've learned, any workflow, anything you've found useful?

Chip Conley (01:08:23):
Yeah, I have a daily blog. It's called Wisdom Well, and it's on the MEA website. When I'm looking for inspiration, AI does it for me, and ultimately, it gives me a first draft. That's good enough for me then to say, "Okay." There's times when I'm missing the inspiration. I tend to write really well in the morning.

(01:08:47):
If it's any other time of the day, I do not like writing creatively. If I have a deadline for tomorrow and it's five o'clock in the afternoon, it's like, "Okay, ChatGPT. I'm on my way to you." I tend to use ChatGPT the most because I don't know, I like Claude as well, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
Okay, awesome. I was going to ask which tool you use. What's your workflow there? Is it you use voice mode? Do you just type out, "Here's what I'm thinking about, write me a little drop blog post?"

Chip Conley (01:09:12):
The good news is that at this point, it knows me well enough and my blogs, and I've actually, it knows my weird sense of humor, so it's able to ape me pretty well. I'll just say, "I need a 250 word post on," like today, today's post was a post that ChatGPT helped me with it. I said, "I believe that there's a refrain that needs to happen with the soul. We tend to say, 'I have a soul, or I don't have a soul,' but what if my soul has me? What if in fact, my job is just to be this vehicle for my soul to go to the next lifetime?"

(01:09:56):
My job is to be this steward of the soul. I said, "Write me something around that." It was just a weird idea. Of course, not all my blog posts are so new age, and I like that. I write a lot on leadership, but that was one that within 30 seconds, I had a 250 word blog post that I then adapted, and there you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:19):
Amazing. Chip, we've covered a lot of ground. We've gone through your entire life. Maybe actually just the tip of the iceberg. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Chip Conley (01:10:31):
Yes. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Chip Conley (01:10:38):
My favorite book of all time, Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl in a concentration camp in World War II. When someone's going through a hard time in their life, I say, "Read that book. You'll realize it's not so bad, what you're going through." It also really speaks to this idea of despair equals suffering, minus meaning. I wrote a book called Emotional Equations that was a New York Times bestseller that spoke to this idea that what if you could take all of your emotions and turn them into equations?

(01:11:04):
Very engineering-minded of me. That's one. I love any book by Liz Gilbert, sort of the opposite. Elizabeth Gilbert wrote Eat, Pray, Love. Her book, she's on faculty at MEA. She teaches here. Big Magic is just a beautiful book about sort of how do you get in the flow to allow the genie to come through you. Her Ted Talk in 2009 was about the fact that genius is not about being the genius yourself. It's about being the receptacle for the genie to come through you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
I want to come back to this equation you shared. I was going to get to it, but I didn't, so this is a good opportunity to. There's a couple that are really interesting to me. This is, you wrote about these in a book. You have a bunch of these equations about living a happier life. The one you shared is despair equals suffering, minus meaning.

Chip Conley (01:12:00):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:01):
The implication there is if you want less despair, increase the meaning.

Chip Conley (01:12:05):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):
Or reduce the suffering.

Chip Conley (01:12:06):
Suffering, Buddhist philosophy, the first noble truth of Buddhism is that suffering is ever-present. If suffering's a constant and you have two variables, using some algebra, I guess, you know that if you have more meaning, you have less suffering. That's that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:25):
The other one that I love is anxiety equals uncertainty times powerlessness. Maybe talk about that one briefly.

Chip Conley (01:12:32):
98% of anxiety comes from two sources. One is what you don't know, and number two is what you can't control or influence, and based upon social science. You can create an anxiety balance sheet and create four columns. First column is what is it you do know about the thing that's making you anxious? The second column is, what is it you don't know? The third column is what is it you can control or influence? The fourth column is what is it you can't control or influence?

(01:13:01):
When you take free-floating anxiety and put it into an equation, it actually makes it more tangible, and you often are less anxious as a result.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:11):
Boom. Okay, so if you're feeling anxious right now, this is an exercise you can do and you'll feel less anxious in like five minutes is what I'm hearing.

Chip Conley (01:13:19):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):
Okay, excellent. Very, very good nugget of advice. Okay, let's keep going with the lightning round. Come back from our tangent. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Chip Conley (01:13:29):
Ted Lasso is, I'm a sucker for that show. When it comes to movies, I'm a total movie buff. We have an annual MEA Film Festival at our Santa Fe campus. I would say that the film that I'm most excited about that is coming out that most people have never heard of, it's called I'll Push You. It's the story of two guys, one of whom is in a degenerative health condition and in a wheelchair, and his best friend pushes him the 500 miles of the Camino de Santiago, and it's the relationship they build along that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:08):
Amazing. Very deep cut. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?

Chip Conley (01:14:17):
Yes. Hair growing material. No. Do you know Viori shorts? I sound like Scott Galloway because he advertises this, but Viori shorts are like, I just love them. They're just breathe and they're comfortable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):
I'm wearing Viori joggers right now. The one downside of Viori, not to make anyone mad, is they're kind of plasticky if you look at the material. I'm trying to like, I don't know, but I do love, there's nothing better. That's the problem. Anything else like this that is all cotton.

Chip Conley (01:14:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:51):
I'm a fan. I have many Viori, I don't know if they're called joggers, just, I don't know, weekenders or something. Anyway, love you, Viori. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find really useful in work or in life? I imagine you have many, but is there one that comes to mind?

Chip Conley (01:15:07):
My favorite one right now is your painful life lessons are the raw material for your future wisdom. The premise of that is that wisdom often comes through the school of hard knocks. When you're in the midst of a really challenging time, you are developing your future wisdom that's going to be valuable to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Okay, final question. You were on the board of Burning Man, or you still are?

Chip Conley (01:15:28):
I was.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Was.

Chip Conley (01:15:34):
I helped found the board of Burning Man. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):
Okay. No big deal. I don't know if you know this, I got married at Burning Man. We had an unofficial wedding there on bicycles, so it's really meaningful to us. I've been there four or five times. What's something about Burning Man that maybe people don't know, some inside story or a really unexpected piece of the journey? I may imagine there's a lot, but what comes to mind?

Chip Conley (01:15:55):
I would say the best not well-known thing about Burning Man is that Burning Man own owns a place called Fly Ranch. Fly Ranch is about 10 miles from Burning Man. Now, when you go to the Burn, the event around Labor Day, you cannot go over there. It's locked off. It's 3,400 acres. If you look at Fly Ranch, FlyRanch.org, I think it might even be, or it's on the Burning Man site, Fly Ranch is the opposite of Burning Man. Burning Man is this alkaline desert.

(01:16:29):
There's no living life there at all. It's very masculine. Fly Ranch is porous, and lots of desert grasses, and hot springs, and hot pools, and birds, and wild horses, and it's one of my favorite hot springs places in the world. Just check it out, and you can go there when it's not during the event. It's quite beautiful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):
It feels like it might've inspired MEA in many ways.

Chip Conley (01:17:00):
It did, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):
Chip, two final questions. Where can folks find you online, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Chip Conley (01:17:08):
Online, MEAWisdom.com is the website for MEA. My website is ChipConley.com, C-O-N-L-E-Y, and I'm on LinkedIn. That's really, from a social media perspective, the thing that I do the most. I actually take my daily blogs and put them on LinkedIn. Then what your community can do, just come say hi, come check me out. If wisdom's interesting to you, and I think wisdom should be interesting to everybody here, on the MEA website, at the very bottom footer, you'll see a bunch of free resources.

(01:17:43):
One of them is called Why Successful Leaders Value Wisdom. It is a free resource, and there's also a free resource down there called The Anatomy of a Transition. Those two free resources, understanding how to build your TQ, your transitional intelligence, and understanding how to develop wisdom are two, to my mind, two of the most important modern skills that we can have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:05):
It's funny when you say you're on LinkedIn. It doesn't resonate with me. Chip Conley on LinkedIn, posting on LinkedIn, something about...

Chip Conley (01:18:13):
I don't know. Why? Because I'm a little too Burning Man?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
You're just, yeah, exactly. It feels like that's not your vibe, but I love that you do it, because that's where the people are.

Chip Conley (01:18:21):
Oh, I put wild, weird stuff up on LinkedIn, and thank God somebody's doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:28):
For some reason, I don't see it. I need to fix that. Chip, this was incredible. Everything I was hoping it'd be, thank you so much for being here and for sharing-

Chip Conley (01:18:34):
Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):
... your wisdom.

Chip Conley (01:18:35):
I am so proud as I go back, like have your proud Papa who just loves to see you in your element, and I just want to make sure everybody knows the following. Lenny was so good to work with. Whenever you were assigned to a project as a PM, I appreciated it because I just knew that we were going to have great conversations. You're just an interesting dude.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):
Well, I appreciate that, Chip. That's going to be the beginning of this whole episode. We're just going to put that up front. Just kidding. That was awesome, Chip. Really appreciate it.

Chip Conley (01:19:01):

## Transcript

Chip Huyen (00:00:00):
A question that get asked a lot and a lot is, "How do we keep up to date with the latest AI news?" Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news? If you talk to the users who understand what they want or they don't want, look into the feedback, then you can actually improve the application way, way, way more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
A lot of companies are building AI products. A lot of companies are not having a good time building AI products.

Chip Huyen (00:00:19):
We are in an ideal crisis. Now, we have all this really cool tools to do everything from scratch and have new design. It can have you write code. You can have new website. So in theory, we should see a lot more, but at the same time, people are somehow stuck. They don't know what to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
All this AI hype, the data is actually showing most companies try it, doesn't do a lot. They stop. What do you think is the gap here?

Chip Huyen (00:00:38):
It's really hard to measure productivity. So, I do ask people to ask their managers, "Would you rather give everyone on the team very expensive coding agent subscriptions or you get an extra head count?" Almost every one, the managers will say head count. But if you ask VP level or someone who manage a lot of teams, they would say, "Want AI assistant." Because as managers, you are still growing, so for you having one HR head count is big. Whereas for executives, maybe you have more business metrics that you care about. So you actually think about what actually drive productivity metrics for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:11):
Today, my guest is Chip Huyen. Unlike a lot of people who share insights into building great AI products and where things are heading, Chip has built multiple successful AI products, platforms, tools. Chip was a core developer on NVIDIA's NeMo platform, an AI researcher at Netflix. She taught machine learning at Stanford. She's also a two-time founder and the author of two of the most popular books in the world of AI, including her most recent book called AI Engineering, which has been the most read book on the O'Reilly platform since its launch.

(00:01:41):
She's also gotten to work with a lot of enterprises on their AI strategies, and so she gets to see what's actually happening on the ground inside a lot of different companies. In our conversation, Chip explains a lot of the basics like, what exactly does pre-training and post-training look like? What is RAG? What is reinforcement learning? What is RLHF? We also get into everything she's learned about how to build great AI products, including what people think it takes and what it actually takes. We talk about the most common pitfalls that companies run into, where she's seeing the most productivity gains and so much more.

(00:02:12):

Chip Huyen (00:04:34):
Hi, Lenny. I've been a big fan of the podcast for a while, so I'm really excited to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
I want to start with this table/chart that you shared on LinkedIn a while ago that went super viral, and I think it went super viral because it hit a nerve with a lot of people. Let me just read this and we'll show this on YouTube for people that are watching. So it's this very simple table you shared of what people think will improve AI apps and what actually improves AI apps. What people think will improve AI apps, staying up to date with the latest AI news, adopting the newest agentic framework, agonizing about what vector databases to use, constantly evaluating what model is smarter, fine-tuning a model. And then you have what actually improves AI apps, talking to users, building more reliable platforms, preparing better data, optimizing end-to-end workflows, writing better prompts. Why do you think this hit such a nerve with people? If you had to boil it down, what do you think people are missing about building successful AI apps?

Chip Huyen (00:05:30):
[inaudible 00:05:30] question that get asked a lot and a lot is that, "How do we keep up to date with the latest AI news?" I'm like, "Why? Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news?" I know it sound very counter-intuitive, but there's just so much news out there. A lot of people also ask me questions like, "How do I choose between two different technologies?" Maybe like recently, MCP versus agent-to-agent protocol? And it was like, "Which one is better or this or that?" I think it's a [inaudible 00:05:59] question you should ask them is like, "First, how much of the improvement could you get from optimal solutions versus non-optimal solutions?" Right? And sometimes they were like, "Actually, it's not much." Right?

(00:06:10):
I was like, "Okay, if it's not much improvement, then why do you want to spend so much time debating something that doesn't make that much difference to your performance?" Another question they ask is like, "If you adopted a new technology, how hard it could be to switch that out to another?" And sometimes they will like, "Oh, I think it could be a lot of work switching it out." And I'm just like, "Hmm, let's say here's a new technology. It hasn't been tested by a lot of people, and if you would adopt it, you would be stuck with it forever. Do you actually want to adopt it?" Maybe you want to think twice about over commit to new technologies that hasn't been better tested.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):
I love your just broader advice is just simple like, to build successful AI apps, talk to users, build better data, write better prompts, optimize the user experience, versus just like, what is the latest and greatest? What's the best model to use right now? What's happening in AI? Let me follow this thread of this idea of fine-tuning and basically post-training. There's all these terms that people hear in AI, and I think this is going to be a really good opportunity for people to learn what we're actually talking about, since you actually do these things, you build these things, you work with companies doing these things. There's a few terms I want to sprinkle in through the conversation, but let's start with this one. What's the simplest way for someone to understand? What is the difference between pre-training and post-training and then just how fine-tuning fits into that, just what fine-tuning actually is?

Chip Huyen (00:07:34):
Chip disclaimer, I don't have full visibility on what this big secretive frontier labs are doing. But right from what I heard, so I think it's like one is, supervised fine-tuning when you have demonstration data, and you have a bunch of experts, "Okay, here's a prompt, and here is what the answer should be like." You just train it to emulate what the human expert could be like. That's also what a lot of people would like, so open-source models are doing as they do it by distillation. So instead of having human experts to write really great answers to prompts, they get very popular, famous good models to generate a response to it and getting this train smaller models to emulate.

(00:08:23):
Sometimes you see people just like... So, that's because I really appreciate open source community by the way, but going from being able to train models that can emulate a existing good model. It's very different from being [inaudible 00:08:38] trained good models, like an output for existing good model. So, it's a big step there. Yeah, we have my supervised fine-tuning, and another thing that's very big, I'm not sure you have guests talking about it already, but reinforcement learning is everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:52):
Let's pause on that because I definitely want to spend time on that, and that's such cool topic that's merging more and more in my conversations. But just to even summarize the things you just shared, which I think is really, really important stuff. So, the idea here is a model, essentially this algorithm piece of code that someone writes and say the frontier models are feeding it just like the entire internet of content, and basically, it's trying to test itself on predicting across all that data the next word, essentially. Token is the correct way of thinking about it, but a simpler way to think about it is the next word in text. As it gets it wrong, it adjusts these things called weights, essentially. Just like, is that a simple way to think about it, even that's just very surface level?

Chip Huyen (00:09:35):
So, I think of language modeling as a way of encoding statistical information about language, right? So, let's say that we both speak English, so we get a sense of what is more statistically likely. If I say my favorite color is, then you would say, "Okay, that should be another color." The word blue would be much more likely to appear than the word like [inaudible 00:09:59], right? Because statistically, blue is more likely to [inaudible 00:10:02] my favorite color is. So, it's a way of encoding statistical information.

(00:10:07):
So when language modeling, when you train a large amount of data, you see a lot of languages, a lot of domains. So it can tell, okay, your basic size is standard. Then the user do the prompts and it could come with the next most likely token. So by the way, it's not a new idea actually. So it's the idea comes very, very old, from the 1951 papers like English entropy. I think it's by Claude Shannon, it's a great paper. And I think it reveals a story I really like is from... Did you read Sherlock Holmes by the way?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:39):
Yeah, I read a few Sherlock Holmes books. Yeah.

Chip Huyen (00:10:41):
Yeah. So this is story of when Sherlock Holmes says using this statistical information to help solve a case. So this is his story. There is somebody left a message with a lot of stick figures. So Sherlock Holmes was like, okay, he knows that in English, the most common letter is E. Then the most common stick figure must be E. And then he goes, he stopped like that, [inaudible 00:11:07]. So the code... So I think there's language. So in a way, it's simple language modeling, but instead of at a work level, he does this as character level and token is something in between, right? A token is not quite a word, but it's bigger than a character. So let's say we say token because it would help us reduce vocabulary because which character is smallest amount of vocabulary right now. So alphabet has 26 character, but words can have millions and millions, right? Whereas tokens, you can be able to get the sweet spot between the two.

(00:11:44):
So let's say that we have the new word, how to say it, like podcasting, right? Let's say it's a new word, but it can divide a podcast and ing. So people understand, okay, podcast, we know the meaning. We know that ing is a verb, gerund, whatever it is. So we even know the word podcasting so that's why the token comes in. But yeah, the pre-tuning is basically encoding statistical informations of language to have you predict what is most likely. I think that most likely is the most simple way of doing it because it's more building a distribution of, okay, so the next token could be more 90% of the the time it could be a color, 10% of the time could be something else. So it basically distribution so language could pick, depending on your sampling strategy. Do you want it to always pick the most likely token or do you want it to pick something more creative? So I think my sampling strategy, I think is something extremely important. It can have you boost a performance in a huge way and very, very underrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
Okay, awesome. So essentially, a model is just code with this whole set of weights, essentially the statistical model that has learned to predict what comes next after certain words and phrases?

Chip Huyen (00:13:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
And then post-training and fine-tuning, specifically, is doing that same thing. So pre-training you get GPT5. Fine-tuning is someone taking GPT5 and doing the same sort of thing, adjusting these weights a little bit for specific use cases on data that they find is necessary to do their very specific use case. Is that a simple way to think about it?

Chip Huyen (00:13:24):
Yeah, I think weights is functions, right? So let's say you have... Maybe it has a functions of maybe Lenny's height is maybe 1X plus something or 2X [inaudible 00:13:38] and plus something is the weights, right? So you change it until you fit the correct data, which is my height and your height. So you can think it's a weight, as just a weight, say function. So you train, adjust the weights so they can fit the data, which is the training data.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:54):
Awesome. Okay. So we're talking about pre-training, post-training, fine-tuning. Is there anything else here that's important to share about just what this is exactly? What people need to understand about these parts of training?

Chip Huyen (00:14:06):
So the vast majority of time, we don't touch on pre-training model. As users, we don't use it at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:12):
Right. It's already done for us.

Chip Huyen (00:14:13):
Yeah. So I think my [inaudible 00:14:15] is a bit of fun process when my friend's training model is they try to play with their pre-training model and they're horrendous. They're saying things like [inaudible 00:14:23] "Oh, my gosh." Yeah, it's crazy. So it's very interesting to look at how much of post-training can change the model behavior and I think that's where a lot of time, is a lot of people are spending energy on nowadays, their frontier lab, is on post-training. Because pre-training, I think... So pre-training have been used to increase the general capacity of capabilities of a model. And it needs a lot of data and model size to increase the model capabilities. And at some point, we are actually have kind of maxed out on the internet data. And people text data max out. I think a lot of people are doing with other data like audios and videos, and everyone's trying to think of what is the new source of data, but where like post-trading, but middle course of this is more of everyone have very similar pre-training data, is that post-training is where they make a big difference nowadays.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:21):
This is a good segue to, you talked about supervised learning versus unsupervised learning. I love, we're getting into this, by the way. This is super interesting. So you talk about labeled data. Basically, supervised learning is AI learning on data that somebody has already labeled and told it, here's correct versus incorrect. For example, this is spam versus not spam. This is a good short story. This is not a good short story. We've had the CEOs of a lot of these companies that do this for labs, Mercor and Scale, Handshake, there's Micro, there's a few others. So is that essentially what these companies are doing for labs, giving them labeled data, high-quality data to train on?

Chip Huyen (00:15:57):
It is in a way, but I think it's more like a product of big equations. So there are a lot more different components than that. So that's why I was talking about reinforcement learning. I'm not sure if your CEO [inaudible 00:16:09] interview bring up that term. So the idea is that once you [inaudible 00:16:14]... So let's say you have a model, give the model a prompt and it produce an output. You want to buy, once you reinforce, encourage the model to produce an output that is better. So now it comes to how do we know that the answer is good or bad? So usually, people relies on signals. So one way to get a first one good or bad is human feedback. They happen to be have two responses. You can, okay, this one one's better than the other. And we do that is because as humans, we tend to, it's very hard to give a concrete score, but it's easier to do comparisons.

(00:16:53):
If you ask me, okay, give this song a score, I'm not a musician and don't know how hard it is. It's like yeah, I don't know what, out of 10 I going to remove six. And if you ask me again a month from now and I completely forgotten, okay, maybe now seven, only four, I don't know. But then if you ask me, okay, here are two songs and which one would you prefer to play for the birthday party? I was like, "Okay, I can prefer this song." So comparisons a lot easier. So [inaudible 00:17:18] have a human, you have human feedback and then you use this human feedback to treat a reward model to tell which and then the reward model help you like, okay, it's a model that produce this response.

(00:17:28):
It's [inaudible 00:17:30] can score, is this good or bad? And you try to bias toward producing better model, the better responses. Another ways you can, instead of using a human, so you can use AI because the response and say good or bad, right? Or in fact the thing is that people are very big on nowadays, verifiable rewards, which it's natural. So basically, they give it a math problem and then math solutions is a model app a solution. Okay, it's expected response should be 42 and if it doesn't provide 42, then it's wrong. Now it's not a good response. So yes, a lot of time, people using this human laborer, human laborers should produce, how to say, expert questions and I say expected answers and in the ways that [inaudible 00:18:16] systems that verifiable so that the models can be trained on. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:19):
Okay, I'm really glad you went there. This is essentially RLHF reinforcement learning with human feedback, which is exactly what I wanted to also talk about, right?

Chip Huyen (00:18:29):
Yeah. So I think it's general, it's a way of learning. It's training is [inaudible 00:18:33] learning and whether it learn from human feedback or AI feedback or verifiable rewards, I think I say it's just different way of collating signals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:44):
Awesome. Yeah. We had the CEO of Anthropic on the podcast and he talked about their version of RLHF, which is AI driven reinforcement learning. I love the way you phrased it where basically you want to help the model, you want to reinforce correct behavior and correct answers, and this is the method to do it, whether it's say an engineer seeing an output from a model being like, "No, here's how I would code it differently." And it's training a different model that the original model works with to tell it, am I correct or not correct? Is that right, roughly?

Chip Huyen (00:19:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:16):
Okay.

Chip Huyen (00:19:16):
I think that's a way of looking into it. I think that's a space is so exciting nowadays because there are so many domain expert task that the model developers want models to do well on, right? Let's say you're accountant. Maybe you want to use a model to have accounting task and need a lot of accounting data examples from accountant. So you need to hire a lot of them, should I do it or everyone [inaudible 00:19:41] physics problems, everyone should do, I don't know, legal questions and stuff or engineering questions or somebody was telling me they want to do, using coding to source scientific problems and not just coding to build product, which is another different whole realm of things. And I also using very specific toolings. I'm not sure what apps you use, but maybe like a [inaudible 00:20:04] app or QuickBooks or Google Excel. They have very specific tools, specific expertise. So you want the model [inaudible 00:20:13] learn.

(00:20:13):
So they need a lot of humans expert in this area should create data to train them and it's a massive thing people because everyone wants a lot of data and wants [inaudible 00:20:25] unlimited budget. But whether, I think this is also a little bit of low-key, interesting economics. I'm not sure you've talked to the guests about, I thought it's very interesting [inaudible 00:20:35] think about because it's very lopsided, right? Because they're only a very small numbers of frontier labs and they want a lot of data and there's a massive amount of startups or company providing related data. So you can see these companies like this startup doing data labeling. They have maybe some massive AR, but if you ask them, "Okay, so how many customers you have?" And they could be very small numbers, I'm not sure. I'm not sure you... I saw you smiling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:03):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we chatted about that.

Chip Huyen (00:21:05):
Yeah, so I'm a little bit like [inaudible 00:21:08] uneasy. I have a company's growing crazy, but it's heavily dependent on two or three companies. And at the same time, if I was this company, frontier labs, what could be the right economical things for me to do? Now I want a lot of startups. I want to have a lot of providers so I can pick and choose, and as this providers can also to compete each other to lower the price and it's so dependent on [inaudible 00:21:34] regardless. So I feel like, yeah, so this whole economics is very interesting to me and I'm curious to see and how it plays out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):
What I'm hearing is you're bearish on the future of these data labeling companies because as you said, they don't have a lot of leverage over pricing because they have so few customers and there's so many people getting into the space. So basically, even though there's some of the fastest growing companies in the world, you're feeling like there's a challenge up ahead.

Chip Huyen (00:22:00):
I'm not sure if I'm bearish on it. I think I'm curious because I think things has a way of work out in ways that I don't expect. So I think that maybe these companies, they have a lot of data, maybe they wouldn't be able to use that to have some insight that helps them stay ahead of the curve. So I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
A very fair answer. Okay, while we're on this topic, I want to chat about evals, which is a very recurring topic in this podcast. This is the other piece of data content these companies share that AI labs really need. Can you just talk about what an eval is, the simplest way to understand it and then how this helps models get smarter?

Chip Huyen (00:22:41):
So I think people approach eval, I think they're two very different problems. One is a app builder and can I say have an app that do maybe a chatbot? Very simple answer first thing that came to my mind and I want you to know if chatbot is good or bad. So it needs to come away with evaluate the chatbot. Another thing is, I think of this as a task-specific eval design. So let's say I'm a model developer and I want to make my model better at code writing. And it was like, "Okay, but how do I even measure code writing?"

(00:23:19):
So I need someone to understand code writing and think about what makes a story good and then design the whole dataset and then criteria to evaluate code writing. So yeah, I think there's that. I think it's more like eval design that is very interesting [inaudible 00:23:39] work criteria, [inaudible 00:23:42] work guidelines, how to do it and then also train people how to do it effectively. So I guess, [inaudible 00:23:49], I think eval is really, really fun because it's extremely creative. I was looking at different eval people built and it was like, "Wow." It's not dry at all. It's just super, super, super fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:01):
We had a whole podcast on evals with Hamel and Shreya. That's exactly what they talked about is just, it's actually really fun to create evals for companies, especially. So let's still dig into that one a little bit more. There's this kind of debate online that, I don't know how big of a deal this debate is, but it feels like people spend a lot of time thinking about this, this idea of, do we need evals for AI products? Some of the best companies say they don't really do evals, they just go on vibes. They're just like, "Is this working well? Can I feel it or not?" What's your take on just the importance of building evals and the skill of evals for AI apps, not the model companies?

Chip Huyen (00:24:39):
You don't have to be absolutely perfect, I think, to win. You just need to be good enough and being consistent about it. Okay, this is not a philosophy I follow, but I have worked with enough companies to see that play out. So when I say, why a company don't eval? Let's say you are an executive and you want to have a new use case. So here's a use case you started out, built and it's like it works well. The customers are somewhat happy. You don't have the exact metric for it.

(00:25:05):
So the traffic keeps increasing, people seem happy, people keep buying stuff and now here's our engineer coming like, "Okay, we need eval for it." And it was like, "Okay, how much effort do we need to go into eval?" And they were like, "Okay, maybe two engineers, this much, this much." And it could maybe would improve that and it was like, "Okay, so how much expected gain can I get from it?" And the engineer would be like, "Oh, maybe you can improve it from 80% to 82%, 85%."

(00:25:33):
And it was like, "Okay, but [inaudible 00:25:35] that two engineers and we going to launch a new feature, then it could give me so much more improvement." So I think it's one of them is eval. Sometimes people think of eval as like okay, this is good enough, just don't touch it. If you do spend a lot of energy on eval, it would only incremental improvement where it spends the energy on another use case and maybe [inaudible 00:25:55] good enough that you can vibe check it.

(00:25:57):
So I do think maybe that's a debate is about. I do think that a lot of time people just get things to the place where it's like, okay, good enough, people run. But in the end, but of course there's a lot of risk associated with it because if you don't have a clear metric, you have a good visibility to [inaudible 00:26:17] applications or models performing it might do something very dumb or it can cause you, I know something crazy can happen. So yeah, so I do think eval is very, very important if you have, if you operate a scale and where failures can have catastrophic consequences.

(00:26:38):
Then you do need to be very tyrannical about what you put in front of the users, understand different failure modes, what could go wrong and also maybe in a space when that it's a feature, the product is a competitive advantage. You want to be the best at it. So you want to have a very strong understanding of where you are and where you are with the competitors. But it's just something that's more a low-key, okay, this is like something is like, okay, that's not the core but it helps with our users.

(00:27:04):
Then maybe you don't need to be so obsessed or theoretical about it. It's like, okay, that's good enough for now and if it fails, then it fails. Okay, I know it's so terrifying. But yeah, I think it's all about the question of return investment. I'm a big fan of eval, I love reading eval. And I says, I understand why some people would choose to not focus on eval right away and choose bringing on new functionalities instead.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
Awesome. That is a really pragmatic answer. What I'm hearing is evals are great, very important, especially if you're operating at scale, but pick your battles. You don't need to write evals for every little feature. Something that Hamel and Shreya shared is that people need just, I don't know, five or seven evals for the most important elements of their product. Is that what you see or do you see a lot more in production that people build and need?

Chip Huyen (00:27:54):
I don't think of just a fixed number on the evals. What was the goal of eval? The goal of eval is to guide the product development. So you see eval, because I think I'm a big fan of eval, is that it helps you uncover opportunities where the progress are doing well. So sometimes, we've seen a very obvious [inaudible 00:28:15] where you look at the eval and we realize it's like, okay, it performed really poorly on this specific segment of users and then we look into it's like, okay, what's wrong with it? And it turns out, it's like we just don't have a good messaging to it. So people should just focus on the things that we're doing poorly, can improve significantly. Yeah, so I kind of like the number of eval is really depends. We have seen product with hundreds of different metrics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:40):
Oh, wow.

Chip Huyen (00:28:41):
People going crazy, this is because that product is general, have different names, have one eval for, I don't know, verbosity, have one eval for user sensitive data and another is for length but has a number of, okay, let's just give a good example, concrete example, like deep research. So you have the application, you have views and model to do deep research for you. Okay, have a prompt. Let me say, okay, do me a comprehensive research on only Lenny's Podcast and help me propose, show me report on what kind of topics he's interested in, what kind of videos could get the most views or what topics that he's missing on that he should be covering, right? Have that prompt. Then how do you evaluate the result? I don't think there's one metrics that would help. Maybe it's like maybe you have a hundred, I think somebody has a benchmark and is get a hundred expert, write a bunch of prompts and they go through, on the answers on AI and do it. And it's extremely costly and slow.

(00:29:46):
But [inaudible 00:29:47] might have something else. First of all, one way I was thinking about it, I was talking to a friend about it and one way it's like, how would you produce the result of the summary? At first you need to, what you do, gather informations and to gather informations you need to do a lot of search queries. You gather, grab the search results and then some of the search results you aggregate and then maybe say, okay, I'm still missing on this. You have to go another route and on another route, [inaudible 00:30:17] have the summary. So every step of the way, you need evaluations. You don't [inaudible 00:30:21] end-to-end. Maybe it was a search query in my first thing about, okay, now I write five search queries. I might look into how good are the search queries? Do they as they similar to each other because you need five search queries are very similar? Okay, Lenny Podcast, Lenny Podcast last month, Lenny Podcast two months ago.

(00:30:39):
It's not very exciting. But if the query is a podcast, the keywords are more diverse and then look at the results of the search query and then say you enter the search query. Lenny Podcast data labeling and they come up with 10 pages, 10 results. And then you come up with like, oh, Lenny Podcast on, I don't know, frontier labs, and you have 10 results. [inaudible 00:31:06] different webpages. Okay, how much of them overlapping... Are we doing both the breadth, getting a lot of page, but also, do we have depth and also do you have relevance because if we come up with a search query, it's completely irrelevant to the original prompt. So I feel like every aspect of it, it would need a way of evaluating. So I don't think it's how many eval should I get, but how many eval do I need to get a good coverage, a high confidence in my application's performance and also to help me understand where it is not performing well so that I can fix it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):
Awesome. And I'm hearing also just especially for the very core use case, the most common path people take in your product is where you want to focus.

Chip Huyen (00:31:51):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
Okay. There's one more term I want to cover and I want to go a somewhat different direction. RAG? People see this term a lot, R-A-G. What does it mean?

Chip Huyen (00:32:04):
So RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generations [inaudible 00:32:08] not a specific true generative AI. So the idea is just for a lot of questions, we need context to answer. So I think it came pretty, I think it's from the paper 2017. So someone was like, so they realized it's for a bunch of benchmark. When the question answering benchmarks, they realized it's like, okay, if we give the model informations about the questions, the next answer can be much, much better. So what they do with that is try to retrieve information from Wikipedia. So for question [inaudible 00:32:39], just retrieve that and then put it into the context and answer. It does much better. So I feel like it sounds like a no-brainer, right? I mean, obviously. So I think that's what RAG is, as a simplest sense, it's just providing the model with a relevant context so that it can answer the questions. And it's where things get really more interesting because traditionally, when it started out, RAG is mostly text.

(00:33:03):
So we talk about a lot of way of how to prepare data so that the model can retrieve effectively. Let's say that not everything is a Wikipedia page. A Wikipedia page is pretty contained and you know, okay, everything about it is about a topic. But a lot of time, you have documents of like [inaudible 00:33:19] and they have a weird way of structures of documents. Let's say that you had documents about Lenny Podcast and in the future, in the beginning a document it's like, from now on, podcast wouldn't refer to Lenny's Podcast. So let's say somebody in the future is like, "Okay, tell me about Lenny. Lenny's work." And because as a [inaudible 00:33:40] document does not have the term Lenny, you just don't know, you might not retrieve it. And if the document is long enough that it's chunked into a different part, so the second part doesn't have the word Lenny, so you cannot reach it. So you have to find a way to process data. So that makes sure it's like... It can retrieve, the information is just relevant to the query even though it might not immediately obvious that it's related.

(00:34:02):
So people come up with only thing of, I think, contextual visual, like giving X chunk of the data, the relevant, maybe in a summary metadata so that it knows or some people use as hypothetical questions. It's very interesting for even the chunk of documents, I must generate a bunch of questions that the chunks can help answer so that when I have a query, it's like okay, does it match any of the hypothetical questions? It can fetch it. So it's very interesting approach. Okay, so maybe before I go to the next thing, I just want to say this data preparations for RAG is extremely important. And I would say this in a lot of the companies that I have seen, that's the biggest performance, in their RAG solutions coming from better data preparations, not agonizing over what [inaudible 00:34:51] databases to use because [inaudible 00:34:53] database, of course is very important to care about things like latency or if you have very specific access patterns like read-heavy or write-heavy, of course, it's like it matters. But in term of pure quality answers, I think the data preparation is just [inaudible 00:35:07].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:06):
When you say data preparation, what's an example to make that real and concrete for us to understand?

Chip Huyen (00:35:16):
So one way is mentioned as in you have chunks of data. So we have think about how big of each chunk should be. Because if it's sort of think about it's a context you want to maximize, maybe you can, it's very simple example. You want to retrieve a thousand words. So if a data chunk is long, then it's more likely to contain more relevant metadata so it can retrieve more. But if it's too long then you have a thousand word. And so chunk is like a thousand words, you can reach one chunk. So it's not very useful. But if it's too short, then you can retrieve more relevant information also. It can retrieve a wider range of documents and chunks, but at the same time each chunk is too small to contain relevant information.

(00:36:02):
So we have very nice chunk design, how big each chunk should be. You add contextual informations like summary, metadata, hypothetical questions. Somebody was telling me just a very big performance they got is that from rewriting their data in the question-answering format. Instead of having... So they have a podcast instead of just chunking the podcast, you just reframe, rewrite it into here's a question, here's answers and produce a lot of them. It can use AI for that as well. So that's one example of data processing. A lot of example I see is for people helping, using AI to help specific [inaudible 00:36:40] use and documentations. And we write documentation. Usually a lot of documentation today is written for human reading and AI reading is different because it's different because humans, we have common sense and we kind of know what it is. So one things are, even for human experts, they have the context that AI doesn't quite have.

(00:36:59):
So somebody told me that what's a big change they have is let's say, that you have a function. The documentation for this, maybe the library. As a library said okay, the output of this one is maybe talking for, I don't know, some crazy term, maybe some temperature or something on the graph. It should be like one zero or minus one. And as a human expert maybe understand the scale, what one in the scale mean, but for AI, just really doesn't understand what that means. So actually, have another annotation layer for AI. It's like, okay, good temperatures equal one means like that. It's not like it's a actual temperature. It's associated with the scale over there. So just saving all this data processing to make it easier for AI to retrieve the relevant information to answer the questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:45):

(00:38:51):
Awesome. Okay. So you've talked a bit about how you work with companies on these sorts of things, on their AI strategies, on their AI products, how they build, which tools they build, all these things. I want to spend a little time here because a lot of companies are building AI products. A lot of companies are not having a good time building AI products. Let me ask a few questions along these lines of what you've learned working with companies that are doing this well. One is just, I guess, in terms of AI tool adoption and adoption in general within companies, there's all this talk recently of just all this AI hype. The data is actually showing most companies try it. Doesn't do a lot, they stop. And so there's all this just maybe this isn't going anywhere. So in terms of just adoption of tools in AI within companies, what are you seeing there?

Chip Huyen (00:39:32):
For GenAI in company, I think there are two types of GenAI toolings that have been, I've seen ones is to internal productivity, like have coding tools, Slack chatbot, internal knowledge. A lot of big enterprises have some a wrapper around models, so with access to maybe some different type of a RAG solution. I think we talk about data or kind of like text-based RAG. We haven't talked about agentic RAG or I haven't talked about multi-modal RAG yet. But this, yes, it's a whole very exciting area around that. So basically, it should allow the employee to access internal document. Somebody ask, okay, I'm having a baby. What could be the maternal or paternal policy or am I having these operations with the health benefit cover that or I want you to interview, I want to refer my friend. What will be the process for that? So a lot of this having chatbot, internal chatbot to help with internal operations.

(00:40:35):
And another things, another category is more customer facing or partner facing. So product customers support chatbot is a big one. If you're a hotel chain, you might have a booking chatbot, which is somehow massive. A lot of booking chatbot because I guess it's... I do have this theory of a lot of applications companies pursue because they can't measure the concrete outcome. And I feel like booking or a sales chatbot, it's very clear. There was a conversion rate right now with that chatbot with human operators and what could be conversion rate with a chatbot and certain, somehow I think it's very clear outcomes and companies are easier to buy into these solutions. So a lot of companies have that customer facing chatbot.

(00:41:20):
So that is another category of tool and I think that for customers or external facing tools, because people are driven to choose applications with clear outcomes. So the questions of adopting them is really based on whether they see the outcome or not. Of course, it's not perfect because sometimes the outcome can be bad not because the idea or the application's idea [inaudible 00:41:52] is bad. It's just because the process of building it is not that great. Yeah. So it's tricky. For the internal adoptions of toolings or internal productivities, that's where it gets tricky. I would say a lot of companies [inaudible 00:42:08] think of AI strategy. I think of AI strategies usually have two key aspects. It's like use cases and the second is talent. You might have great data for great use cases, but you don't have talents and you cannot do it.

(00:42:23):
So a lot of time at the beginning with GenAI and sometimes I'm really admire a lot of companies for that, it's just like [inaudible 00:42:28] was like, okay, we need our employees to be very GenAI aware, very AI literate. So what I do is I start maybe adopting a bunch of tools for the team to use. They have a lot of up-skilling workshops, they encourage learning and then it's a really, really good thing. And it's also willing to spend a lot of money into adopting, giving people chargeability, subscriptions, purchase subscriptions, [inaudible 00:42:56] subscriptions to get the employees to be more AI literate. And that's the thing is a lot of... There's a [inaudible 00:43:05] may say, okay, we spend a ton of money on this tooling, but then we don't see because you can see the usage, but people don't seem to use them as much and what is the issue. So yeah, so I think that is tricky. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):
What do you think is the issue? Is it just they don't know how to use them? What do you think is the gap here? Do you think we'll get to a place of just like, wow, work is completely different because of AI for a lot of companies?

Chip Huyen (00:43:32):
The main thing is it's really hard to measure productivity again. So I talk to a lot of people on their website. First of all, [inaudible 00:43:40] is coding. A lot of companies not using coding agents or coding [inaudible 00:43:45] coding. And I was asking, I was like, "Do you think that it helps with your productivity?" And a lot of times, the questions are very [inaudible 00:43:56] okay, I feel like it's [inaudible 00:43:59] better. And I said, okay, because we have more PRs, we see more code and then immediate [inaudible 00:44:04]. Okay, but of course, code, number of live code is not a good metric for that. So it's really, really tricky and it's something funny. So I do ask people to ask their managers because I work with usually VP level, so they have multiple teams under them. So I asked them, okay, do you ask some managers, okay, would you rather have access...

(00:44:28):
Would you rather give everyone on the team very expensive coding agent subscriptions or you get an extra headcount? Let's say maybe and almost everyone could say the managers could say headcount. But if you ask VP level or someone who manage a lot of teams, they would say just like [inaudible 00:44:48] good one, AI, a system as tools. And the reason is that we could say okay, because as manager is right, because you are still growing. You're not as a level when you manage hundreds of thousands of people. So for you, having one HR headcount is big. So you want that not for productivity reasons, but because you just want to have more people working for you. Whereas for executives, you care more about, maybe you have more business metrics that you care about. So you actually think about what actually drive productivity metrics for you. So it is tricky and I think that the question of productivity. I'm not sure it's fundamentally is the [inaudible 00:45:32] more productive, but it's just like we don't have a good way of measuring productivity improvement.

(00:45:37):
Another thing is also very [inaudible 00:45:40]. And I think it's like people do tell me that they notice different buckets of employees, different reactions to AI assist tools. First of all, I keep going back to coding because coding is big and it's easier to reason somehow. So it says I have different reports. One team would tell me that... One of people tell me, okay, amongst on his engineers, he thinks senior engineers would get the most output, would be more productive because it's like, okay, so that person's very interesting. So he actually divided his team to three buckets, but he didn't tell them, obviously. He was like, okay, here's more currently best performing, average performing and lowest performing. And then there's a randomized trial. So they give half of each group access to Cursor. And then [inaudible 00:46:31] noticed over time it was like, okay, something funny. The group that get the biggest performance boost, in his opinion, he was very close to his team.

(00:46:39):
The biggest performance boost [inaudible 00:46:41] the senior engineer, the highest performing. So the highest performing engineer get the biggest boost out of it. And then the second group is the average performing. So his opinion is like, okay, the highest performing engineers is also normal practice. They also know how to solve problems. So they have some solved problem better. Whereas the people who have the lowest performing, they only don't care much about work. So it's easier to just go on autopilot, get it to generate that code and just do it or just don't know how to do it. Another company, however, they tell me just actually, senior engineers are the one most resistant to using AI as this tooling because they said it's like, okay, but AI, because they are more opinionated and they have very high standard. It was like, okay, but AI code, [inaudible 00:47:30] code just sucks. So just very, very resistant in using it. So I don't know, I haven't quite been able to reconcile very different reports on that yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):
This is so interesting. So just to make sure I'm hearing what the story, so there's a company you work with, that did a three bucket test with their engineering team where they created three sorts of groups, the highest performing engineers, mid-performing engineers, lowest performing engineers, and gave some of them, so they gave some of them access to say, Cursor. Was it Cursor or what did they give them access to? It was Cursor, right?

Chip Huyen (00:48:03):
I think it was Cursor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Okay, cool. And so within-

Chip Huyen (00:48:05):
I didn't work with them. This is more like a friend company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:08):
Okay. It's a friend's company.

Chip Huyen (00:48:09):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
So did they give half of the higher performing engineers Cursor and half not or how did they do the split there?

Chip Huyen (00:48:14):
Yeah, so they give half of the entire company but half of each bucket. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:18):
Whoa.

Chip Huyen (00:48:19):
And then they observe the difference in productivity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):
I see. So how do they even do that? They're just like, "Okay, you get cursor, you don't get cursor." How did they do that? That's so interesting.

Chip Huyen (00:48:31):
Yeah, I didn't get into the mechanics of it, but I was like, "I respect you for doing a randomized trial on that."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:33):
That is so cool.

Chip Huyen (00:48:33):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:34):
Okay. Wow. How large was this engineering team? Was it like hundreds of people?

Chip Huyen (00:48:38):
It's not that large. It's about maybe 30 to maybe 40. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):
30 to 40. Okay.

Chip Huyen (00:48:44):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:44):
Wow. Okay. So they found that the highest performing engineers had the most benefit from using AI tools and then behind them was the middle tier engineers and the worst performers or the lowest performers. Okay.

Chip Huyen (00:48:59):
But it's also not the same everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:59):
Right. Right. Right, right.

Chip Huyen (00:48:59):
Some companies are different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:03):
Right. This other example you shared of just senior engineers in this one example are most resistant to changing the way they work, which I get. I do feel like the most valuable people right now other than ML researchers and AI researchers like yourself, are senior engineers because it feels like junior engineers are just, so much of this is now done by AI, but an engineer that knows what they're doing that understands how things work at a large scale with AI tools, just basically infinite junior engineers doing their bidding, feels like an extremely valuable and powerful asset.

Chip Huyen (00:49:39):
Yeah, I definitely really appreciate, as you see companies, we appreciate engineers who have a good understanding of the whole systems and be able to have good problem solving skill are thinking holistically instead of locally. Or when our company have seen the way they work, as they told me is we're completely different now. So they actually restructured engineering org so that they get more senior engineers should be more in the peer review because they get writing guidelines on what is a good engineering practices, what is the process would be like.

(00:50:12):
Or maybe like okay, so they write a lot of processes on how to work well. And then they have more junior engineers just produce code and submit PR, but senior engineer more in the reviewing case. So I think it might be prepared for the future. So another company actually told me something very similar. So preparing for the future once they only need a very small group of very, very strong engineers to create processes and reviewing code to get into production but get AI or junior engineers to produce code. But then the question becomes just like, how does one become a very strong senior engineer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:54):
Right. That's right. That's right. That's the problem. Yeah.

Chip Huyen (00:50:57):
Yeah. So I don't know what's the process I was thinking about, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):
No one's thinking about it. It's a problem. We won't have any more in 10, 20 years. There'll be no more engineers because no one's hiring junior engineers. Although I could make the case. Junior engineers, people just getting into computer science right now, are just AI native. And in theory, you could argue they will become really good really fast if they're curious, aren't just delegating, learning and thinking to AI, but learning how to actually, using it to learn how to code well and architect correctly. You could argue they'll be the most successful engineers in the future.

Chip Huyen (00:51:33):
I do think that what I mentioned said relating to architect. I think I grouped that in my system thinking. I do think it's very important skill because I think AI can help automate a lot of disjointed skills, but knowing how to utilize the skills together to solve problems is hard. So that's a webinar between Mehran Sahami who is one my favorite professors. He was a chair of the curriculum at the CS Department at Stanford. So he spent a lot of time thinking about CS educations, what should students learn nowadays in the area of AI coding. And then the other person is Andrew Ng, which is of course, is a legend in the AI space. And Mehran Sahami, Professor Sahami, said something very interesting. He said a lot of people think that CS is about coding, but it's not. Coding is just a means to an end.

(00:52:27):
CS is about system thinking, using coding to solve actual problem and problem solving will never go away because what AI can automate more stuff. The problem is just get bigger. But as a process of understanding what caused the issue and how to design step-by-step solution to it, will always be there. So I think an example of, I actually have a lot of issues with AI for in the way of it's debugging. So I'm not sure you use a lot of AI for coding, but something I have noticed and also seen from my friends, it's like it is pretty good when you have very clear, well-defined tasks. Maybe write documentations, fix specific features or build an app from scratch. Doesn't have to interact with a large access in code base, but you added something a little bit more complicated, maybe required interaction with other components and stuff. It's usually not that good.

(00:53:21):
And for example, I was using AI to deploy an applications and it was testing out a new hosting service I was not familiar with. It was like, okay. Usually they inform me, so working AI does give me is confidence to try a new tool. Before what AI is like trying new tools has written, not documentations for the beginning, but I was like, okay, just try it out and learn. So I was testing out this new hosting service and it kept getting a bug, so was very, very annoying. And it was like, okay, I asked [inaudible 00:53:51], fix it. And it kept changing the way, maybe change the environment variable, fix the code, maybe not change from the function to this function, maybe change the language, maybe it doesn't process JavaScript, I don't know, whatever. And it didn't work. And it was like, okay, that's it.

(00:54:07):
I'm just going to read documentation myself and see what's wrong. And it turns out, it's like I'm on another tier, the [inaudible 00:54:16] I want did not, is not available in this tier, right? So I feel like, okay, so the issue with [inaudible 00:54:22] was just trying to focus on fixing things from a different component versus the issue is from a different component. So I think of, okay, be understanding how different components work together and where the source of issue might come from. You need to give a holistic view of it. And it's made think is like, okay, how do we teach AI system thinking that I have all the human experts having very much [inaudible 00:54:46] scaffold just like, okay, for this kind of problem, look into this, look into that, look into that, and then stuff. So [inaudible 00:54:53] that could be one way, but that's also made me think is, how do we teach humans, system thinking? Yeah. So yeah, I think it's very interesting skill. I do think it's very important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):
That's exactly the same insight Bret Taylor shared on the podcast. He's the co-founder of Sierra. He created Google Maps. He was CEO of Salesforce, Quip, a few other things. And I asked him just like, should people learn to code? And his point is exactly what you said, which is taking computer science classes is not about learning Java and Python. It's learning how systems work and how code operates and how software works broadly, not just, here's a function to do a thing.

(00:55:32):
One thing that I wanted to help people understand, you wrote this book called AI Engineering, which is essentially helping people understand this new genre of engineer and you have this really simple way of thinking about the difference between an ML engineer and an AI engineer, which has a really good corollary to product managers now, of just an AI product manager versus a non-AI product manager. The way you describe it and fill in what I'm missing is just ML engineers built models themselves. AI engineers use existing models to build products. Anything you want to add there?

Chip Huyen (00:56:05):
One thing I really dislike about writing books is that it has to define this and I think it's like no definitions would be perfect because they always be edge cases. But yeah, in general, I think it's just like GenAI as a service, more as a service, when somebody build the models for you and the base model performance is a pretty [inaudible 00:56:26]. So it's like it's enabled people to just like, okay, now I want to integrate AI into my product. I don't need to learn [inaudible 00:56:34] even though knowing that could really help. But yeah, it makes an entry barrier really low for people who want to use AI to build product and at the same time, AI capabilities are so strong. It's also increased the possibilities, the type applications that AI can be used for. So I think yes, both entry barriers' is super low and a demand for AI applications a lot bigger. So it feels, it's very, very exciting. It's opens up a whole new ball of possibilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:04):
Yeah. It's like now you don't have the time, now you don't have to spend time building this AI brain. Now you can just use it to do stuff, such an unlock. Okay. Maybe just a final question. You get to see a lot of what's working, what's not working, where things are heading. I'm curious just if you had to think about in the next two or three years, just where things are heading, how do you think building products will be different? How do you think companies working will be different if you had to think of maybe the biggest change we expect to see in the next few years, in terms of how companies work?

Chip Huyen (00:57:40):
I think in a lot of organizations they don't move that fast, but at the same time, they move faster than I expected because again, I think it's like bias and don't work with dinosaur companies who don't care. I think a lot of executives who come to me are very forward-looking. So maybe for me, I'm very biased towards organizations is move fast. So yeah, I think one big change I see just in organizational structure. I think this a lot of value plays in... So before we have a lot of disjointed teams. We have very clear engineering team, product team, but then there's a question of who should write eval? Who should own the metrics? And it turns out, eval, it's not a separate problem. It's a system problem because you need to look into different components, how they interact with each other. You need user behaviors because you need to know what users care about so that you can write eval reflect what users care about.

(00:58:44):
So all of that you can sort it from you look into different component architectures, place guardrails and stuff. So it's just engineering, but understanding users is what product. So because of a lot of things and eval is extremely important. So the kind of bring product team and engineering team, even marketing team like user acquisition, very close to each other. So yes, since in a ways if people are structuring, so that's more communications between previously very distinct functions. Another thing is I also see as teams, of course, I think about what can be automated in the next few years and what work cannot be automated. And I seen that people already shedding, actually it's a little bit scary to think about it, but I also think it's the teams, they would've told me, it's just like okay, this is good and you and me, but we have got rid of these functions for a lot of things like previously outsourced, for example.

(00:59:37):
Traditionally, it's a business outsourcing that's not core to them and can be in a more systematized. So with that, you can actually use AI to automate a lot of that. And so as a separation people thinking more of what is the value of junior engineers or senior engineers, how should we restructure engineering org for that? Yeah, so I do definitely think that is one thing to successful organization. People are just moving pieces around and thinking about use cases, whether you need to spin out new use cases and who would lead a new effort. That is one big change. Another thing in terms of AI, I think there's, I'm not sure how true this is. I guess, I'm also on the camp of thinking that it has merit, is a camp of okay, base models we have probably not quite maxed out, but we're unlikely to see really, really strong, crazily strong model.

(01:00:44):
So you remember when we have GPT, right? And then GPT2, which is a big step up, an [inaudible 01:00:49] better than GPT and then GPT3, which much, much bigger than GPT4, much, much bigger. And then of course, GPT5, but it's GPT5, that scale of much bigger step jump compared to the previous, I think it's debatable. So I think that we had disappointment, the base model performance improvement is not going to be mind-blowing. It was in the last three years. So I think there's a lot of improvements when I see in the post-training phase, in the application building phase. And yes, also I think that's where I feel I would see a lot of improvement there. I also very interest in multimodality. So we've seen a lot of text base, but I think there's a lot of audio, videos use cases that is very, very exciting.

(01:01:45):
And I think audios is not quite as solved. Well, I think because I do work with a couple of voice startups and when it comes to, think about voice, it's an entirely different beast. So let's say have chatbot. We go from a text chatbot to voice chatbot. It's like the consoles are completely different because now with voice chatbot, we need to think about latency because I think multiple steps, first have voice to text, text to text, text question into text answer and then text to voice answer. So you have multiple hops and latency become very important. And there's a question, what does it make you sound natural? So for example, people think of in AI and humans, when humans talk to each other, if I say, you try to interrupt me and say, Chip [inaudible 01:02:36]. I would pause and I try to hear you out.

(01:02:38):
But sometime even if I just like say some word, like acknowledge when I, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that I shouldn't stop. It's just continue. So the question of forced interruption and whether it's, should I stop or not, it's a big in what perceived as natural conversations. And that's also regulations because a lot of time, people want to build AI chatbot, voice chatbots that sound like humans, try to trick users into thinking that they're talking to humans, but also maybe potential regulation saying okay, you have to disclose to users when you talk, if the bot is talking to is human or AI. So I think this a whole space, I think it's not quite as solved as you think. But it's not quite like an AI foundation model problem because a human interruption detection, it's actually a classical machining problem.

(01:03:32):
It's a different framing, but you can give classifier for that. Or the question of latency, actually a massive engineering challenge, not an AI challenge. Of course, it can be an AI challenge because people are trying to build voice-to-voice model. So instead of having to firstly transcribe the voice from me into text and then get a model [inaudible 01:03:54] text answer and get another model should turn from text to speech, you can just do voice-to-voice directly. So that is something we're working on, but it's very hard. Yeah. So yeah, so even audio, I think of it's the easier than video because video have both image and voice. It's already pretty hard. So I think there's a lot of challenges in that space.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:16):
That was an awesome list of things. Let me mirror them back real quick. So what you're predicting in the next few years, things that will change in the way we work, and these actually resonate with so many conversations I've had on this podcast. So says, just kind of doubling down on where things are heading. One is the blurring of lines between different functions instead of just design engineering. Everyone's going to be doing a lot of different things now. Two is, just more of work being automated with agents and all these AI tools and just in theory, productivity going up. Third is, a shifting from pre-training models to post-training, fine-tuning and things like that because to your point, models maybe are slowing down in how smart they're getting.

(01:04:57):
Although, I'll point folks to the, I had a chat with the co-founder of Anthropic. He made a really good point here. He's like, we're really bad at understanding what exponentials feel like when we're in the middle of that. And also, models are being released more often. So the difference between them we may not notice because they're just happening more often versus GPT3 came out a year before after GPT2. Maybe true, maybe not. And then the fourth point you made is this idea of multimodal, investing in multimodal experiences. I cannot wait for ChatGPT voice mode to get better at interruption, exactly what you're saying. I'm just talking to it and then someone makes a little sound and it's like [inaudible 01:05:33]. Okay. And then you have to, and then it's like, and then it stops talking. It's so annoying.

Chip Huyen (01:05:36):
I'm shocked that we don't have better voice assistant at home yet. I think I have been testing out a bunch, honestly. I keep hoping, oh my God, that could be the one and then I know how many of them I just had to give away because they're not that good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:49):
I think it's coming. I hear it's coming. Anthropic's working with someone that, I don't know if it's launched or not yet.

Chip Huyen (01:05:54):
Yeah, [inaudible 01:05:55] want to bring back to what you mentioned about your guest from Anthropic, mentioned about the performance improvement. I think there's a big change, I think this difference between a model-based capability. So I'm talking about the pre-trained model versus the perceived performance perform. So let's say, I'm not sure you thought about, are you familiar with the term test time compute?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:20):
I don't think so. Help us understand.

Chip Huyen (01:06:26):
So this idea is like okay, you have a fixed amount of compute. So you're going to spend a lot of compute on pre-training or training the model. Pre-training and then I've spent a lot of some compute fine-tuning and the ratio of pre-training to the post-training compute is crazy, varies between different lab. And also, since then has a spend compute on generate inference. When I have a trends and fine-tuning model and now you want to serve it to users. So I might type a question in a prompt and if generate, do inference and that requires a compute. And I guess, I feel about discussion of should I spend more compute on pre-training or fine-training or inference because inference and people thought I was just like test time compute. So spending more compute on inference is like calling test time compute as a strategy of just allocating more resources, compute resource to generate inference when I shouldn't bring better performance and how does that do it?

(01:07:22):
Let's say you have a math questions and maybe instead of just generate one answer again generate four different answers and say okay, whichever is the best according to some standard or okay, I have four answers and then maybe three of them say 42 and one of them says 20. You say okay, three of them in agreement. So the answer should be 42. So just people shouldn't generate a bunch of it. Or another thing is a lot of time like reasoning, thinking, it just be able to generate more thinking tokens, like spend more time thinking before showing the final answers. It's like require more compute but also give more better performance. So yeah, so I think it's like from the ease of perspective when the model spend more time exploring different potential answers, thinking longer, it can give you much better final answers. But the base model itself does not change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
Awesome.

Chip Huyen (01:08:17):
Does it make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
Yes, that does. Absolutely.

Chip Huyen (01:08:18):
Yeah?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:19):
That is a good corollary to Ben Man's point.

Chip Huyen (01:08:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):
Chip, we covered a lot of ground. I've gone through everything I was hoping to learn and more. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?

Chip Huyen (01:08:34):
So I do work with a few companies that does these things of they want employees to come up with ideas. So there's a big debate on what is a better way for AI strategy, should they be top out or bottom up, should executives come up with one or two killer use case and everyone allocate resource to that, should you give engineers and PMs and smart people come up with ideas. And I think it's a mixture of both. So some companies it was like, okay, we hire a bunch of smart people, let's see what they come up with and they organize more hackathons or internal challenge to get people to build product. And one thing that I noticed, a lot of people just don't know what you built. And it shocked me why I feel like we are in some kind of an idea crisis, right?

(01:09:21):
Now, we have all this really cool tools to have. You do everything from scratch, can have you design, it can have you write code, it can build website. So in theory, we should see a lot more, but at the same time, people are somehow stuck. They don't know what to build. And I think it's like, maybe you see a lot of had to do with maybe society expectations because we have gone into this phase of specializations, people very highly specialized and people are supposed to focus on one thing really well instead of being a big picture. And we don't have a big picture view. It's hard to come up with ideas of what you build.

(01:09:58):
So I know what, when I work with this company on this hackathon, we do work on come up with a guideline, how to come up with ideas. And usually what we think of is like, okay, one tip is go look from the last week. For a week, just pay attention to what you do and what frustrates you. And when something frustrates you, think about, is there anything we can do? Can it be done a different way? So it's not frustrating and you can talk, people can swap to accept [inaudible 01:10:27] or teams, and I even see they come on frustrations. Maybe there's something you can think about just to build something around that. So yeah, so I feel like just notice how we work, thinking of ways, constantly ask questions, how can this be better? And then I just build something to address the frustrations, I think it's a good way to learn and adopt AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):
I think people have felt exactly what you're describing every time they open up one of these vibe coding tools where you could just describe anything you want. I'm like, "I don't know, what do I want?" And I love this very tactical piece of advice, just like what frustrates you, just pay attention to where you're frustrated. For example, I just built a very cool little vibe coded app. I was working on a newsletter post inside Google Docs and I pasted all these images into the Google Doc, from screenshots and stuff and then I forgot, oh yeah, you can't take images out of Google Docs. It's like this Hotel of California experience where you can paste stuff into it, very hard to get images back out. So I just went to all the vibe coded tools and just built an app that I can give you a Google Doc URL and it let me download all the images automatically. And it worked amazingly well and I made it really cute. And I'll link to it in the show notes.

Chip Huyen (01:11:33):
OH, I would love to see that. I'm very bullish on using AI, just create micro tools. It's just something just make your life a bit easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:41):
A hundred percent. I feel like that's one of the main ways people are using these tools, just a little niche problem they have. With that, Chip, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Chip Huyen (01:11:54):
Yeah, always. No, no, no. It depends on how hard the questions are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:58):
They're very consistent across every guest. So I imagine you've heard them before. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Chip Huyen (01:12:10):
I'm really terrified of book recommendations because I feel like what books [inaudible 01:12:15] you should read really depends on what they want and where they're in life and where they want to get to. But just several books that I do think's have really changed the way I think and see the world. So one thing is The Selfish Gene, that's to understand, it actually helped me with the question whether I want to have kids or not because it's understanding more of a lot of our functions, the way we operate is the functions of our genes and genes want to do one thing, to procreate.

(01:12:46):
So yes, in a way, the book also proposed another thing is so everyone wants to live forever and maybe it's not consciously, but subconsciously, we do want that. And there are two ways. One is via genes. Genes [inaudible 01:13:00] want to continue forever, but [inaudible 01:13:03] two ideas. I think there's something [inaudible 01:13:05]. It's just like being able, if you have some ideas out there and then it's last for a long time, it's going to live on. I know it's a little bit abstract, but I thought it's very interesting.

(01:13:16):
The other books I really, really like is from the book from Singaporean previous, I think he is [inaudible 01:13:24] as a Father of Singapore, I don't know, Lee Kuan Yew. I'm not sure what's the title is, but he was the one who led Singapore from, he's changed Singapore from a Third World country to a first world country within 25 years. And I have never seen any country leaders spent so much effort into putting down his thought of how to build a country like that.

(01:13:47):
And as I talk a lot about public policy, how to create policies that encourage people to do the right things that is good for the nations and also talking about foreign affairs, foreign policies, the liberation of the country, but other. So it's a really good book to think about. For me, it's a system thinking, but it's a different kind of system which a country, which a lot of us don't get a chance to ever experiment in our life. So it's good to learn about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):
What was the name of that second book?

Chip Huyen (01:14:15):
It's called From Third to First World. Actually, I think I have it somewhere here. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:20):
There it is.

Chip Huyen (01:14:21):
It's a very heavy book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:21):
Show and tell.

Chip Huyen (01:14:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):
That's awesome. I definitely want to read that. That's a really good [inaudible 01:14:26]. I've heard a lot about just the impact he's had and I've seen all these videos on Twitter of just his really wise insights into how to build a thriving society. And clearly, it works.

Chip Huyen (01:14:34):
Yeah. Can you believe, how does he time to write such a thick book? It's insane.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:39):
That is. Claude, please summarize. I'm just joking. By the way, Selfish Gene, I also absolutely love that book. That is such a good choice. It's such an under the radar kind of book that really changed the way I see the world as well. So really good pick. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Chip Huyen (01:14:56):
So I watched a lot of movie and TV shows as a research because I working on my first novel and I recently sold it. So I'm interested what makes, it's a drama. It's not a science fiction or anything that tech people usually read. So it very, I know it's a very out of left field and very, so it's almost like reading, watching TV to see what kind of stories become popular, trying to understand the trope and stuff like that. So I'm not sure if the audience will like...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Well, what's one? What's one that taught you something about writing?

Chip Huyen (01:15:35):
I think like Yanxi Palace. It's a Chinese TV show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:37):
Cool. Okay. I haven't heard that one on the podcast before. Okay, cool.

Chip Huyen (01:15:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:43):
Next question. Do you have a life motto that you often think about, come back to when you're dealing with something hard, whether it's in work or in life?

Chip Huyen (01:15:51):
This sounds very nihilist. I think to say, in the end, nothing really matters. Usually, I think of in the grand scheme of things, in a billion years, nothing will, no one would ever be there. I think okay, someone will argue with me about that. [inaudible 01:16:05]. So my theory's like, in a billion years, none of us would ever exist. So whatever messy things, like crazy things we do or how bad we do it, I mean, no one would be remember, wouldn't be there to remember it. And I think in a way, it sounds scary, but it's very liberating because it just allows me say, okay, let's just try things out, right? Why does it matter? And there's a story of recently, so I have some family member who passed away recently. And I was talking to my dad because I couldn't be home for that.

(01:16:36):
I was asking my dad like, "Okay, os there anything I can do to make the person..." Something like comfort. So anything that you can get the persons. And my dad was just like, "What can he possibly want at this moment?" It just made me feel at the end of life, there's nothing that can bring you, like material can bring you joy. There's no money, no product, nothing. And in way, it makes me feel like, okay, what really do I really care about at the end of the day? So I guess it's like I think about it. It's just like, okay, maybe I fail it, maybe I don't get that contract. Maybe those things, but in the end of life, I don't think that actually really matters. So in a way, it's quite liberating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):
I know you said it might be nihilistic. This is what Steve Jobs shared too in one of his most famous speeches. Just we all die someday day, so don't take things so seriously and it is freeing. Absolutely. It just makes you appreciate every moment, every day you have. Just like, yeah, let's just do something hard and scary. Okay, final question. You talked about how you're writing a novel. Most people in tech have never written something creative and fiction. What's just one thing you learned in the process about how to write better stories, better fiction?

Chip Huyen (01:17:46):
A lot of time when we read, we get tripped up by some small things. So I think I want to do creative writing because I just want to go a better writer and it tells us maybe try a different audience could have me become better at anticipating what this different type of audience would want to hear and what they care about. So it's a way for me to get a... So I think if I write it or even any kind of content creations is about predicting the user's reactions, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:14):
The next token.

Chip Huyen (01:18:15):
You do a podcast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
Just kidding.

Chip Huyen (01:18:17):
Yeah. Yeah, so you do a podcast, it's like, okay, what kind things that the users could find engaging, right? And I find this a little bit and a lot of companies you have launch a product, you have a narrative coming out and say, okay, how do we position this product in a way that users would want? So I feel like I have done technical writing for a while and I felt like I had some experience trying to predict what engineers would want to hear or care about. But then I don't have any experience like this, completely different type of audience. So that's what I want to, creative writing, writing a story. And that's why I was doing a lot of research [inaudible 01:18:55]. I mean, doing research [inaudible 01:18:56] enjoyed a lot, watching a lot of dramas. I just see what people like. So one thing that I care about is, I think I learned what emotional journey was from a editor.

(01:19:05):
So when we write something we care about how users would feel across a story. We want something in the beginning, we want something, we need to have a hook so that people continue reading. But we also don't want too much of drama because we'll get too tired because you're emotionally exhausted because it's like you're being emotionally manipulated a lot of time. So it gave a emotional journey, maybe have some climax or something more chill, maybe like... And also care about another thing I didn't realize is, for me, for technical writing, you entirely focus on the content, the argument. It's very impersonal. For example, people like ML compilers, doesn't matter if they like the person telling them about compiler or not because it's just objective [inaudible 01:19:56]. But for a novel, people care about character likeability.

(01:20:00):
So in the first version of my story, it makes the characters a little bit more, very logical, very rational, and just does everything just very rationally. And then the feedback I got is, I have a very good friend read it and he was like, he's an amazing person, he's a great person. And he was like, "Chip, I'll be honest, I hate that person." So it doesn't matter as a story, it's just like the person is so unlikeable, that's why he doesn't want to continue. So is a second version. It makes that person, the character more likable. How she makes that character more likable is that you put in some vulnerability sometimes it's like okay maybe it's person have setback because sometimes we can relate to it. So in a lot of ways, it's very interesting. A lot of it is about understand the emotional bit, like how the users feel, not just about the story but also about the characters.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:50):
That is so interesting. Wow. I learned a lot more there than I thought. That was awesome. Really good example. Chip, two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out and maybe work with you or maybe even just share the stuff that you offer if folks want to reach out. And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Chip Huyen (01:21:08):
I'm on social media, LinkedIn, Twitter. I don't post a lot, but I keep telling myself that I should do more because I kind of like the conversation with readers. So I'm actually about to I start a Substack. So I have a placeholder for Substack right now and I'm thinking of doing it for more system thinking because I think it's a very interesting skill. I'm also thinking of doing a YouTube channel on book reviews and basically books than help you think better. So I think it's the first book I'm a review is probably like this book because it's my favorite book growing up and I've been keep on reading it. So yeah, so how can you be helpful? Send me books that you like, books that help you have changed the way you think or change you the way you do anything. So I would appreciate it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:00):
Amazing. I'm excited to read that book.

Chip Huyen (01:22:02):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:03):
Chip, thank you so much for being here.

# Launching and growing a podcast | Chris Hutchins (All the Hacks, Wealthfront, Google)

## Transcript

Chris Hutchins (00:00:00):
Yes, there are four million podcasts. However, there are only about 150,000 podcasts that have had 10 episodes and have published in the last 10 days. So the easiest way to be in that top 5% ish. I don't know what the math there is. About 3%, 4% is to just stick to it. Like if you just do an episode a week for 10 weeks, you're now in the top 4% of all podcasts that anyone has created.

Lenny (00:00:30):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Chris Hutchins. Chris is not only a former product manager, founder and investor, he just this month went full-time on his podcast and the independent creator path. When I was looking for advice on how to build a podcast, Chris shared this awesome deck with a ton of great advice that he's built throughout his journey, and so I thought it'd be fun to spend an episode talking about all the things that you should know about launching and growing a podcast. Chris's podcast is called All the Hacks, covers all the ways to financially optimize your life, and it's one of the biggest business podcasts in the world. Chris has also been on the Tim Ferris Show actually, interviewing Tim Ferris.

(00:01:15):
He's also head of new product strategy at Wealthfront where he took some big, bold bets within the company, which we talk about. Chris is awesome and I am excited for you to learn from him. I bring you Chris Hutchins after a short word from our wonderful sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart.

(00:02:06):
The other day I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all, learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod, take the first step towards an organized happy team today, again at notion.com/lennyspod. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

(00:03:05):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta, over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today. Chris, welcome to the podcast.

Chris Hutchins (00:03:48):
Thanks for having me. I'm excited.

Lenny (00:03:50):
This is going to be a pretty unique episode, I think. You're a product manager and we're going to talk about some of the things you've learned being a PM on some really killer products. But what I want to spend most of our time on is talking about how to launch a podcast. You've built one of the most popular, biggest business podcasts in just like a year and a half. You've taught me some stuff, you've helped other people with their podcast and so I just thought it'd be really helpful just to talk about just the skill of building a podcast and all the things you should know. How does that sound?

Chris Hutchins (00:04:21):
Sounds great. You just did a episode about growing a newsletter business, which I was like, "This is awesome because I have a newsletter and I want it to be bigger." And I think anyone that's has knowledge to share. I talked to a PM yesterday who was like, "Oh, I've got all these product ideas. Maybe I'll start a podcast." So totally, this is fun.

Lenny (00:04:36):
Awesome. That's exactly how I've been thinking about it. First we did the newsletter and then podcast maybe the other things, I don't know what's left.

Chris Hutchins (00:04:42):
YouTube channel.

Lenny (00:04:43):
YouTube channel?

Chris Hutchins (00:04:44):
[inaudible 00:04:44] I don't know if you feel this way, but YouTube. I feel like just putting a podcast on YouTube isn't enough, I need to learn the skills of YouTube.

Lenny (00:04:51):
Yeah. All right. I got to get MrBeast on, that's the next goal. To set a little foundation for folks, to give him a little sense of your background and some of the things you've done in your career. Can you just talk about some of the biggest things you've done in your career, which you've been up to and then what you're up to now and also about your podcast?

Chris Hutchins (00:05:09):
I'm kind of like a happenstance product person. I basically really liked startups, but I didn't know what job I could have as a non-technical person. And I joined my first startup probably 10 years ago and was like, "I will do anything." And they were like, "Do business development." But it turns out we didn't have anyone who also was doing products, so they were like, "What should we build that people will buy?" So I was like, "Well, I got to figure out how we turned this API we were building for location services into a product." Left that to join other startup with a few people we co-founded, did the Jack-of-all-trades role at a startup and then quickly were acquired by Google about a year in, and I went through the interview process and they were like, "You're a PM." And I was like, "Oh, great, what does a PM do?"

(00:05:51):
I didn't really totally know I'd never worked as a PM. Went through Google's kind of like week of training and got thrown into it and I think I've now learned with a lot of time that being a PM is awesome. Being a PM at Google when we were working on Google Plus was not awesome. Transitioned pretty quickly over to Google Ventures, did venture capital for three years, left to start another company trying to make financial advice more affordable, more accessible. Grew that for about two, three years and we ended up selling that company to Wealthfront where I ran a new product strategy. I most recently just left that role after three years and started going full-time on All the Hacks, which is my effort to help everyone upgrade their life, their money, their travel. I'm the spreadsheet for everything, optimizer and do all this research to try to help people live better, happier, wealthier, healthier lives. And I have a podcast where we share all the hacks to do all of it.

Lenny (00:06:43):
Amazing. While we're on the podcast, we're going to dig into this stuff more. Where can folks, find it. It's called All the Hacks.

Chris Hutchins (00:06:48):
Anywhere you listen to podcasts right now, search All the Hacks, you can find it at allthehacks.com. I'd be surprised if someone listening to this is more of a newsletter reader than a podcaster, but allthehacks.com/email is the newsletter too.

Lenny (00:07:02):
Oh, newsletter. I love it. All right, coming back to your last gig at Wealthfront, from what I understand your title was New product Strategy and Andy Rachleff, who was the CEO for a while, kind of legendary figure. He co-founded Benchmark. He's just like this brain that... I listen to him every time I hear him on a podcast. He basically pulled you into Wealthfront and specifically wanted you to focus on figuring out new business ideas, new business lines, new product lines within Wealthfront. Is that right?

Chris Hutchins (00:07:31):
Yeah, so we had an engineer at the time who came up with this idea called Self-Driving Money. I was like, "Gosh, what if you could automate and optimize your entire financial life and you didn't have to rely on human financial advisors?" And we heard from our customers forever that they pay us to not talk to someone, our demographic doesn't want a bunch of humans in the mix. And so we had this idea but we didn't really know what it was. So Andy was like, "Gosh, you've been spending time thinking about financial planning and software and as an entrepreneur, could you come in and help us build Self-Driving Money?"

(00:08:00):
And I was like, "What is it?" They're like, "Well, we got a bunch of ideas from an algorithmic standpoint about how to do it." But, "What exactly is it?" So it was thrown into, "Let's do a bunch of customer research, let's talk to a lot of people and let's try to come up with as audacious of an idea as we could for how you fulfill the promise of automating and optimizing someone's entire financial life to the point that they don't have to think about their finances on a daily basis and they know the right things are happening."

Lenny (00:08:28):
When I think Self-Driving Money, I'm picturing money just driving around, like a Tesla. Money meets Tesla.

Chris Hutchins (00:08:34):
Yeah, the vision I had was what are the core pieces of financial life that are stressful? It's like, "I got to move money, I got to contribute to these different accounts. I want to make sure I have enough to pay my bills." And so what we ended up with was a product called Autopilot that would monitor your core banking account, whether it was a checking account at Wealthfront or not at Wealthfront or whether it was an account at Wealthfront. And we would say, "Let's make sure we leave a certain amount of money." And you could tell us that much. And then we would say, "Great." Now we had basically a series of things to fulfill with any excess. It was like, "Let's make sure you keep this much as a three-month emergency fund, max out your Roth IRA. Let's make sure you max out your 529 for your kids and let's put the rest in your kind of taxable just brokerage account." And we would just periodically say, "Oh, you got extra money, let's sweep it over and do what we need to do with it so you don't have to think about it."

Lenny (00:09:22):
Can you talk about the impact this had on the company and also just how long of a endeavor this was within Wealthfront?

Chris Hutchins (00:09:29):
It was a quick endeavor to try to start talking to people. This was just throw in the mix. I have a very poor sense of time, but let's say somewhere between six and 12 months maybe before we put something really in front of someone that could execute on all the features, there was a lot of prototype UI testing. I think Andy, he's legendary. If anyone listening to this, wants to learn about product market fit, Andy is your guy. I believe he coined the term, he teaches the class at Stanford. And the lesson was really find something people are reaching over the table want, and make sure you have that validation. And so we were putting things in front of people, clickable, full prototypes, and I remember we got to one where someone was like, "Can I go get my husband? I need to show him this."

(00:10:12):
And then I created this thing, which I'm sure is not that new, but I would start pretending that the product existed in the interviews. Only to find out, at the end, people was like, "Oh, it's not out yet." And they're like, "What I want to use..." You could really feel the like, "No, no, no, no, this has to be out. I want to start using it." So we found this thing that a small number of people were very excited about and we knew that a product, this was going to be a high risk bet because people don't automate their financial lives today. People drive to go pick up fast food and if you could with a push of a button, bring it to their house, you're making a thing that they do much more efficient. Right now, well, technically they do this manually, but trusting software to do it is something that we knew would be a higher risk bet.

(00:10:59):
And I think the takeaway, I would say the impact on the company was not as high as we had wanted in that it didn't become this wild top of funnel. I think it's similar to Tesla's autopilot. It's like nobody goes and says, "I just want to buy this car because of this feature." I'm sure some people do, but once you're in the ecosystem, it had huge impact on making it easier for people to start saving more, making it easier for people to be more confident in their finances and just automate all that behavior. So I would say the letdown was, it wasn't the big, huge top of funnel thing where people are like, "Oh, this is all I've ever wanted." Even though if you interview people and you're like, "Gosh, would you like a product that could just automate all this stuff?" They're like, "Yes, I would love it."

(00:11:43):
And then you hand it to them and you're like, "Do you want to use this thing?" And they're like, "Well." It's very hard to test that. And so what we found was it was a win in terms of it. It moved a lot of metrics for saving more money, increasing contributions and that kind of stuff, but it didn't become this growth channel, which Andy would say product market fit is exponential organic growth. So I would say by that metric, we didn't have product market fit, but as a tool to make a system of products so much better. We have the cash account with all the checking features, we have an investing account, we have retirement accounts. So this really brought it all together and that was super valuable.

Lenny (00:12:18):
Awesome. So here's my big question. What have you learned? You spent a lot of time thinking about big bets, big innovations, working within a company to come up with something totally new. What have you learned about how to approach that within a larger company? How do I successfully innovate? How to think about launching big bets, how to structure teams, anything along those lines?

Chris Hutchins (00:12:37):
I've learned a few things and I think some of them I've learned came naturally being a founder before being a PM. But you think that customer research is all you need to build a product at a company, but figuring out how to create excitement internally and get buy-in from other teams because they're the ones that are going to build it. They're the ones that are going to help market. It's all a team effort. Sometimes you get caught up, at least I found, as a PM of like, "Oh, we got the customer insights, we did the testing. It's all positive." And then you show the ratings you got from sub survey or the engagement or some clips and that's not the end of it. The end is creating this compelling vision for what you're building. And then the thing I learned from being a founder is, gosh, you have to state your vision and your mission and why you're here, every all-hands.

(00:13:27):
It seems so crazy because it's core to you why we would build this, what it's purposes, why it's amazing. But as a founder, I was like every week I was like, "Hey everybody, before we get started, this is the mission we're on, this is why we're doing it. This is the thing we're doing in the world." And as a PM sometimes you're like, "Well, I told people three weeks ago and I put it in that email that I sent out to everyone and it was in the top of the PRD, so why hasn't everyone understood why this product exists?" And I realized very quickly that, that same thing is true. So if you want to make a big bet, if you want to make a big impactful product, you have to bring people along with you. And your ability to speak publicly, persuade people, build influence within the company. Those things are all as important as your ability to identify a user need and build a product that solves it.

Lenny (00:14:15):
Awesome. This reminds me a lot of Airbnb, where the founders, all-hands share the vision and the strategy that they came up with that year. Every single all-hands. And it's always like, "Yeah. Yeah, we know. We know." But to your point, it's so powerful and important.

Chris Hutchins (00:14:28):
And some people don't know. Some people we're not paying attention that one all-hands, we're kind of missed it out, skip all-hands. Often there's just, you need everyone to be able to in... And this is a little segue to podcasting and we'll come back to it, but I start my show with saying, "Hello and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, the show about upgrading your life, money and travel." Because I just want everyone to know this is exactly what this show's about, so when their friend asks them a question, they're like, "This is exactly what it is." And the same thing is true about a company's mission, a product, vision, anything you want everyone to really understand it, be able to talk about it succinctly and just have a very cohesive narrative in their head. That's a really big one. I think the other one is just understanding the customer, not just by talking to them, but just being in the mix, playing with all the products.

(00:15:14):
Something I asked a few of my colleagues before this, "What are things that I've particularly done well?" And they were just like, "Gosh, I feel like you understand what's happening outside of the walls of our business better than a lot of people." And maybe that's talking to a lot of other people who are founders talking to a lot of other people, starting companies, going to read all the comments on new financial products on Product Hunt. Really just trying to understand people beyond just customer research. And so that was another thing that I think... As a founder, you're always looking for product market fits, you're always trying to learn. Sometimes at a company it's really easy to get caught up in the research you've already done and the customers you've already talked to and you forget to kind of step outside and go talk to other people and see what other people are doing. And I'd say don't get caught up in what competitors are building and try to feature parody them, but just understanding the space outside of the walls of your business.

Lenny (00:16:06):
One thing I'll add to your point about reminding people of the strategy and the vision is if you can also help them understand how their team and project connects up through that, create kind of a little tree of, "Here's all the teams, what they're doing. Here's all connects to the pillars of focus and themes and then here's how it connects to the North Star metric and or vision mission. "That kind of adds another wrinkle of like, "Oh, wow. I get it. I get why this team's important."

Chris Hutchins (00:16:30):
There's a great analogy, I'm sure if I send a link you could put in the show notes or something about a football team. And it's like the GM's goal is to sell out the tickets and win the conference championship and it actually tiers it down. It's like, "Well, there's a defensive line coordinator." I'm not even that big of a sports person, but it's like the defensive line coordinator's job is just one specific thing, but they kind of explain how it all levels up to this one North Star metric for the company or two in that case. And I think that's just so important and when you're talking to people at your company with your colleagues, it's not just what it does. It's like, "This product will automate people's money movement so they don't have to move their money and it happens automatically." And that's cool, but it's equally as important to remind everyone, "And then they don't have to worry about their money every week and then they don't have to worry that their contributions might leave them without enough money in their checking account to pay their rent."

(00:17:22):
There's these two components of it which are, what does it do, but what's the feeling you want someone to have? And that gets into product vision versus just the product feature set. And whenever we've written product visions statements about things we're building, it's like, "Imagine a world where someone can feel this way about their money." And it's like, "And then this thing will do that." That's the product strategy. It's how you execute on it. And so Reforge has this awesome product strategy kind of product vision roadmap that levels them all up, which I really like as a another resource.

Lenny (00:17:54):
The Reforge. I just recorded another podcast this morning actually, and what you just said reminded me of it, where a lot of people focus too much on features and not enough on benefits. And the stuff you're talking about is just like, "Think about what are the benefits of the person." Versus, "Here's feature one, feature two, feature three."

Chris Hutchins (00:18:10):
The last little skill, and I know you, you've talked about this, but I think it's something that I was fortunate enough to not care about. Which I think is, when you focus too much at a company about like, "Ooh, I want the promotion" you get caught up in this world where you're like, "If I want the promotion, I need to do what my boss wants." And I had this fortunate benefit of... Like my last job, I was the CEO. I didn't care about my title, I didn't care about leveling up. I came in and I was like, "I want to continue trying to execute on this vision of this thing that I wanted to do." What that actually meant was my only metric I cared about was impact and trying to build a product that would work. And I think in any job in any company, it turns out you think that doing what your boss wants is actually what's going to get you promoted.

(00:18:55):
But the people that I've had work for me or I've worked alongside that seem to always be the outperformers, are always the people that are just solely focused on having the most impact on the company. I think the thing I learned, which I thanks to Andy Rachleff for teaching me this is when you push so hard for your ideas and you have really strong beliefs, you have to also make sure you state your intent. Because sometimes people think you're acting out of self-interest. I'd be like, "Oh, we should delete this feature and build this crazy thing. It's going to be amazing." And people are like, "Oh, Chris just thinks his idea is better than everyone."

(00:19:27):
And so he taught me, he's like, "It would go a long way before you said that, you said, "Hey guys, I've got some crazy ideas, but before I say them, I just want you to know that all I care about is that the company is successful. And I think this idea will make the company successful. And that's why I'm so excited about it. I don't need to own it. I don't care who owns it, I'm just really excited about it."" And when you state your intent, you give people a little bit of ease in thinking you know what it might be. And even though I'm sure half the people listening work at a company where their culture is like assume best intent is one of the pillars, it's still our nature to assume that if someone's shooting down an idea we have that maybe it's out of their own self-interest.

(00:20:03):
And I've learned that when you have crazy ideas and when you're pushing back against a lot of people, if you can make sure you constantly remind them why you're doing it and what you care about, it goes a lot further than if you just kind of come in there with sharp elbows and try to push for crazy things.

Lenny (00:20:19):
Reminds me, I think Andy is the person who on a podcast once said that every year he picks like a, "We're going to bet the company on this idea." Kind of project, is that?

Chris Hutchins (00:20:28):
I would say we've done that a few times. I think the thing that I always told people that I wanted to work on is like, "I want to work on a project that if successful makes everything we do as a company today feel like it's not that important because we did something that was 10 times bigger than everything we're doing today. And what we're doing now is just 10% of the company." Those are the kind of crazy ideas I like to work on. They're very hard sometimes you're like, "Ooh, I've got one." And then it just doesn't work. Sometimes you do one and it takes a turn. But I think that when companies find those things, they're so powerful. But if you don't have the buy-in for management that that's your goal... Andy, he always talks about slugging average, not batting average. He's like, "I don't care if you hit the ball every time. If one in 10 times you hit a home run that's better than someone who hits it every three out of 10 times but gets out a lot."

(00:21:15):
He thought about that and the balance. He's written a lot internally about the balance between working on iterative improvements to current features and then taking big bets and trying to find the balance amongst it all. But I think he does believe there is always exploration necessary for taking big bets and trying to take swings that could have outsized impact. You got to balance it because you're often wrong. And I think that's something that I was like, "That's the thing I want to work on." As someone who is kind of running a company, when you get to go to a big company and you're like, "Now I can solely focus just on this big product bet. I don't have to worry about hiring and recruiting and all these other things." So that was fun.

Lenny (00:21:52):
Speaking of being solely focused on something, let's talk about the podcast. So this is kind of the new thing that you're going to be focused on full-time. You just left Wealthfront and you launched the podcast maybe a year and a half ago, correct me if I'm wrong, by a year and a half ago. The podcast is Top 30, top 40 business podcast. It's probably gone a lot of higher at some points. And so there's a bunch of questions I want to ask about just how you launched this thing and built this thing. But broadly, what did I miss about the [inaudible 00:22:18] framing of the podcast?

Chris Hutchins (00:22:18):
Oh, yeah. That's it. It's about 18 months old. Been doing, gosh, probably about almost 100 episodes, not quite there. Weekly show and I went on parental leave part of the last 18 months and I tried to balance family and just grinding on this and it's been a passion project on the side and I'm very excited to see all the different kind of legs and tentacles that the brand and the content can have.

Lenny (00:22:45):
What kind of benefits and good things have come out of having a podcast and launching a podcast or running a podcast?

Chris Hutchins (00:22:51):
I think we all run into people and you're like, "Gosh, this person's really smart. I wish that I could just pick their brain for an hour." And sometimes you could just email them, be like, "Hey, could we schedule some time in a month and we could just chat?" But that sometimes just feels like a weird thing to ask. The podcast gives you this great platform, you're like, "Well, I have a podcast. And so I would love to invite you on and help you amplify your message and spend an hour trying to understand everything about topic X, Y, Z." And sometimes it's really nerdy and nuanced and sometimes it's broad, but being able to have a reason. I think one of my first episodes was with a guy named Morgan Housel who wrote a book called Psychology of Money. I read the book, I was like, "This is a great book. I have so many questions."

(00:23:32):
But like what I'm I going to od? Randomly email this person I don't know and say, "Hey, I loved your book. Can I just ask you questions for 45 minutes?" I would never do that. But I randomly emailed him and said, "Hey, we've never met. But I have a podcast." I don't even think it had launched, "It's launching next week, but I'm really excited about it. Could I pick your brain?" And he was like, "Sure." So I would say the biggest thing is it just gives you a platform to explore your curiosities on things provided that you can really focus the thing that you talk about on one vertical, niche, something so that people learn what it's about. Because the hardest part about podcast growth is there's like four million podcasts and you've got to find a way to stand out in a sea of many podcasts.

Lenny (00:24:12):
Let's actually talk about that. I was going to ask you about that. There's like four million you said, that seems right. It's probably a four million launched to date. Also, if you're someone that's thinking about, "Should I do a podcast? Should I not do a podcast?" Do you have any advice for just signs that this might be a worthwhile endeavor with your time versus signs you probably should not do this, do not even-

Chris Hutchins (00:24:34):
I'll give you two perspectives. So one is, yes, there are four million podcasts. However, there are only about 150,000 podcasts that have had 10 episodes and have published in the last 10 days. So the easiest way to be in that top, I don't know, 5% ish. I don't know what the math there is, about %3, 4%, is to just stick to it. If you just do an episode a week, for 10 weeks, you're now in the top 4% of all podcasts that anyone has created. Now, that doesn't mean you're in the top 4% of the 150 active podcasts. So what I would say to that is... I mean, maybe you have a massive platform already, in which case just go start the podcast. But if you don't already have a massive platform, it is unlikely statistically, that this thing is going to work. So absolutely, do not start the podcast if you wouldn't do it for free, making no amount of money in perpetuity or as long as you want to experiment with.

(00:25:31):
That's one thing I'll throw out there is you are most likely going to start a podcast and it will not take off and be wildly successful. However, I've met plenty of people who have hundreds of listeners and hundreds of episodes and they stuck at it because they truly loved the thing. If you don't know if you love the thing, it's very easy, which is what I did to say, "I'm going to have one season of eight episodes." And I committed to record eight interviews and put eight interviews out in the world. That was it all I committed to myself. And I said, "If that doesn't work, then I will be fine and say, "Here is season one and there's just not a season two." And I would be okay with it." So you can commit to see if you like it before you do it, but chances are, and you might have found something similar when you started creating content, it's like for the first six, nine months, there's no revenue coming in.

(00:26:23):
It's a lot more work than it seems. Everyone I know that has no podcast and goes to having a podcast, they're like, "Oh my gosh, I thought this was just once, one hour a week, I just talked to somebody." It's like, "Now, I have to prepare for it. I got to write up show notes, I got to make sure it's edited properly, I got to recruit people. Turns out you reach out to 10 people, two reply, one is willing to schedule this week." There's just a lot that goes into it. So I'd say only do it if you're excited to do it, even if five people are on the other end.

Lenny (00:26:49):
Talking about the time investment, how long does it take you per episode, hours-wise? And then how long did it take you to kind of prep launch?

Chris Hutchins (00:26:59):
And this has evolved a bit as the podcast has generated enough revenue to hire other people. But in general, I would probably spend, depending on how well I knew the topic or the person, anywhere from two to 10 hours preparing for an interview. If someone wrote a book at the beginning I was like, I got to read the whole book, I got to take notes. Then I was like, "Well, if I read the whole book and take notes, then I kind of know everything. So I'm going to read a few chapters." I wanted to listen to everyone on different interviews. Some people are really hard, some people have only talked about one topic and you want to get them on another topic. I interviewed Carrie Walsh Jennings, who's a three time gold medalist at the Olympics for beach volleyball. And I listened to every interview she'd ever done because only 3% of each interview was about not volleyball stuff.

(00:27:45):
And I was like, "Well, I don't want to talk about volleyball, I want to talk about performance and how you can train." She won a gold medal while she was pregnant. This is a serious level of physical and mental preparedness that I wanted to dig into. So that's one big piece of it. After it's done, then it really depends on the style of show. If you have this NPR style editing where it's very narrative driven, it could take you a long time to go through the editing. For me with interview style, I think it takes me about an hour to go back and listen to it at a little, speed up pace. And then go in and be like, "Ah, this thing wasn't worth keeping in. Or I mean, we had to repeat something and let's cut that out, or this person stumbled on their words."

(00:28:27):
Fortunately there's some amazing software. Now I use a piece of software called Descript, which basically imports all the audio, transcribes it to, let's call it like 95% accuracy. And then you can edit the podcast like you would edit a Google Doc. It's crazy. You're just like, "Oh, let's delete all the ums, control F, um. Ignore all ums." And then you listen through it and you're like, "Oh, that um, was really necessary, let's put it back in." And little edits like that. But that tool makes the editing process really easy. From the get-go, I had an audio engineer who would actually mix and master and add in the music and that kind of stuff.

(00:29:02):
So I would say each guest is probably at least 10 hours plus probably two or three hours of coordination and outreach to three or four people that you reach out to in order to get the one. Now I've since, hired someone who helps do a little bit of research. So they might go listen to two or three episodes, read a couple chapters of book and put up some notes with links to those various places. So I can then take that and take my time from 10 hours to three hours.

Lenny (00:29:31):
I'll share my experience briefly. It's a little different, which is really interesting to hear your experience. So I launched the complete opposite of your advice, which is I just launched big with like, "I will do this forever. This is my new thing. I have 40 guests lined up, here's who they're going to be." And I think it's partly because I already went through that initial period of uncertainty, whether I can keep this up with a newsletter, which you said eight to nine months. Which is exactly how long it took me to do the newsletter every week to get to a point where I'm like, "Yes, I can keep this up for years. Let's start adding a paid plan." So I think I was just more confident that I can keep at it.

(00:30:06):
And then I actually planned to monetize from the beginning. I think partly again, because I had the newsletter already. And I will say, so I don't edit that myself. I have a production group that is a game changer. So you can save a lot of time and I don't know if you've gone to a producer or anything, but I feel like most people eventually do.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:25):
I've now switched to someone who went back, listened to the first 20 or 30 episodes and said, "Oh, I get what you like to cut out of a conversation." And I'll end and say, "Hey, take that 90-minute conversation. And I think there's probably 20 minutes to cut out." And they do a very good job of getting pretty close.

Lenny (00:30:42):
Awesome.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:42):
To the point that some episodes I'm just like, I don't even look at it.

Lenny (00:30:45):
Yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:45):
It's just recorded and done.

Lenny (00:30:46):
Yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:47):
When it comes to launch, I would say one of my suggestions is to get a few things in the bag. Line up... You don't want to launch and then be scrambling. So I tend to think launching with two or three episodes, either all at once or in a week is a really valuable strategy. You talked about in the intro, you're like, "Sometimes it's been a higher ranked, but top 30." I think I've been top 100 in the business category all the way to top five in the business category, maybe top 10 and just all the way in between.

(00:31:18):
And the reason for that is that the ranking charts are all driven by different variables than you would imagine. They're driven a lot by momentum of new subscribers, at least on the Apple charts than actual downloads. So I have a friend who launched a podcast and had a huge following on social media and so out the gate was able to garner a ridiculous number of new subscribers to the point that she was the number two podcast overall, all podcasts in the world.

Lenny (00:31:45):
Holy shit.

Chris Hutchins (00:31:45):
It is crazy for a week or two, a woman named Erika Colberg, she has a podcast called Erika Talk.

Lenny (00:31:51):
Oh, yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:31:53):
But it's not number two anymore because it's so driven on the momentum of how often you can get new subscribers. She's still in the top 100 of business podcasts, but to get to the number two spot overall, it's all about number of new followers per hour. And if you can get a ton of traffic early on, you can drive that. And I will say the value of you doing that is now you've got this screenshot of like, "Look, I was top 10." And by the way, she did the same thing I did. The moment I was top 10, the second I was in top 10, I immediately took all those guests that were on my dream list and I was like, "Hey, I've got a top 10 podcast. Go look at it right now and see that it's in the top 10." So you can always say that forever after it happens once, you can always use those things. So capitalize on that.

(00:32:39):
So you had the newsletter before. I had a newsletter I'd written on casually for various things throughout my life and for my last startup. And so I kind of put it all together to try to carry a big launch so that we really spike the rankings, maybe qualify for Apple does this new and noteworthy thing. And so there's a lot of stuff you can do to build momentum at launch, but at the end of the day, all the momentum in the world doesn't matter if your content's not good. So I try to say content for me is product market fit for building software. It's like you need to have a good podcast. And so if you launch big, one of the downsides is you're like, you don't really get that moment of tweaking and testing and seeing how it is. And I will say, I did five episodes in the fifth one. I was like, "This is number one." The first one I recorded came out, I don't know, fifth. But the fifth one I recorded came out first because I just knew it was episode one.

(00:33:32):
And the guest that I had on, and we talked about travel hacks, a guy named Leigh Rowan, he's come on twice. It was just like this awesome energy episode about everything you want to know about travel hacks, allthehacks.com/one. So save yourself the need to scroll through the whole list. But if your content isn't a unique perspective, you don't have a unique way of saying it. It's going to be really hard to stand out in the sea of podcasts. So I always say, be you, be authentic. Try to be someone's favorite. Don't try to be everyone's okay podcast. I remember Tim Ferris was saying... I got a chance to go on Tim Ferris's show and interview him about podcasting. And he's like, "Look, I did an episode about how to..." I think it was like how to make violins or something. And he's like, "I was so fascinated about this. 80% of people were like, what is this episode? But 20% of people thought it was one of the best episodes I'd done that year."

(00:34:24):
And I think half of his top 10 episodes of all time are people you wouldn't recognize. So I would focus on what gets you excited, not focus on what you think will move the metrics. Because every time I have a guest where I'm like, "I really think this person's going to move the metrics." It doesn't. And then I interview someone who no one has ever heard of, and I get these emails like, "Wow, that was such a good episode. Can't be. Oh man, I'm so glad you did that one." I was like, "You don't even know this person is."

Lenny (00:34:50):
Very similar experience in many ways across a lot of the things that you said. Something that you did mention that you shared previously with me is, and this is advice that I've thought about a lot, is you should be somebody's favorite podcast. That's like a sign that you're doing something right. Can you expand on that?

Chris Hutchins (00:35:08):
There's this whole idea of your build your 1000 true fans. And I think anytime you're creating something in the world, you want people to be your advocates for it because those are the people that are going to share it. Those are the people that are going to write the reviews, those are the people that are going to send you the ideas. Those are the people that are ultimately, when you make a call-out on a podcast like, "Hey, I'm looking for someone to help build this company or this enterprise." That are going to reach out and want to work for you. I find it so valuable to build that relationship with people. And it's even more valuable with podcasting because podcasting is such an intimate medium. You're in someone's ear and they're actively listening to you while they're going about their life. They're going on a walk, they're [inaudible 00:35:52], but you're right there.

(00:35:53):
And I get so many emails, they're like, "Ah, I feel like I'm just sitting on the couch with you while you're talking to me." And you create this really close relationship and the more you can create for those people and be their favorite time of the day, their favorite thing. Someone once told me, "Make sure you're consistent with the time you release because you'll get people that are like, "It's Wednesday morning, where's my episode? This is how I... It's become a ritual in my life."" And so, I don't know. I just think it's so valuable to build that early kind of excited user base and those 1000 true fans that I always try to put something out that's someone's favorite.

(00:36:30):
And I actually surveyed the audience about 50 episodes in and ask, "Which was your favorite episode?" And every episode except one was someone's favorite. There's one episode that, no one's favorite. So I'm still waiting. Maybe next time I survey someone will be like, "No. No, that one was my favorite." But every other episode of 50 episodes was someone's favorite. And it was like the coolest feeling knowing that every episode was someone's favorite.

Lenny (00:36:57):
That's exactly what happens with my newsletter. I get a reply with every newsletter and someone's like, "This is my favorite one yet." Okay, somebody really likes this one. It's so interesting.

Chris Hutchins (00:37:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:37:09):

Chris Hutchins (00:38:07):
This is an interesting one. So my podcast actually started as a parenting podcast from the perspective of dads. And I was doing all this research. I built this probably 75-page Notion doc all about parenting. It was like I had a kanban board for all the things I needed to do in each trimester of the pregnancy. And then the fourth trimester after the baby was born, I had all these checklists. I had a stroller spreadsheet that had, at least, let's call it 15, 20 different features that you could filter on. Dimensions, cubic volume of when you sum up the dimension, everything. It was crazy. And I was like, "I'm so obsessed with this." And I was like, "Nobody's really taking this kind of crazy optimized approach to processing parental information except a few people." Emily Oster, by the way, if anyone out there wrote a few books, I really loved her pragmatic science approach. But I just didn't see a lot of this and I especially didn't see as much content coming from dads.

(00:39:07):
And I was like, "I'm so excited." And then we had our daughter and for some reason I was like, "I love her. But the topic of parenting and optimizing every aspect of it just wasn't what it was before we had the child as after." I was like, "Wow. But I bought this microphone and I figured out how to use all the editing software and I had never even recorded an episode." And it just ended up that I was like, "That topic just wasn't right for me." And I went on another friend of mine's podcast guy named Kevin Rose, who was a co-founder of a company we started, he started Digg back in the day. And in the middle of it we'd been talking about this, I've been brainstorming ideas, and in the middle of his podcast he's like, "Hey, tell us about your new podcast."

(00:39:50):
And then I was like, "Kevin, I haven't nailed down what it is." And he's like, "Yeah, it's fine. Why don't you just record a response to that question and email it to me before this episode goes live and then you could just tell everyone what your podcast is about." And then I was like, "Okay, I'll think about it." And the next day he was like, "Dude, I need this by Friday." I was like, "Oh, man. So I have two days to figure out what my podcast is." And I talked to a lot of people and they're like, "What do you love, what do you love talking about?" I was like, "Gosh." What question someone said is, when you're at a dinner table, what's the thing that you talk about where you notice that everyone at the table is leaning in and trying to listen and pick your brain on and maybe sends you a text after?

(00:40:27):
And I was like, "It's probably all the hacks I have for traveling for free, for getting upgrades, for saving money, for shopping online, for optimizing my health or anything, house hacking, saving money on my rent." And every time I bring those up, people are like, "I like saving money. I want to travel for free." And they're leaning in, they're like, "Which credit card do I get? Is this one bad? What about this one?" And I couldn't come up with a name. I had hundreds of names. It was like life upgraded, optimized your life. But every time I described what it was, I just said, "It's life upgraded. I'll teach you all the hacks to do this." And then someone, I can't even remember who was like, "What about just All the Hacks?" And then I looked and I was like, "Is allthehacks.com available?"

(00:41:08):
I was like, "What? It's available." It's like... Get the domain. And then I very quickly recorded a response to Kevin's question, which was like, "Yes, I'm launching a podcast called All the Hacks, here's what it is." And I had to go create a trailer and upload it all in three days. And I think I was fortunate that I just had the time pressure that I had a thing to get out. So I'd say one, what do you love talking about at the dinner table? What gets you excited? What do people reach out to you for expertise on? What do you spend your time going down deep rabbit holes on the internet on? Because all of those things are going to be part of your life as a creator. And then two, if there's any way you can force yourself to just have to make a decision because I get stuck in this analysis paralysis, that's great.

(00:41:51):
So find some friend of yours that's like, "I'm tweeting about your podcast on Friday, or I'm going to include you in my newsletter next month." And give yourself an artificial deadline or even a real deadline to just put a stake in the ground. And you could change the name, you could pivot the topic, you could pivot the style of content. All those things can happen after, but just get started because you'll get to learn whether you like doing it, how it feels. And you could always... This is another fun hack. You could create a podcast and make a private feed and people can add a private feed to their podcast app. So if you want to get some feedback, you can just send people a URL and say, "Hey, paste this URL and the Apple Podcast player and listen to a couple episodes and let me know what you think." Before you make that plunge to send it to the whole world.

Lenny (00:42:34):
Awesome. I actually heard that interview with Kevin Rose back in the day, and I checked out the podcast, I think I actually subscribed and it felt very natural. So nice job.

Chris Hutchins (00:42:43):
Yeah. Little did you know that it was inserted in post production, recorded on a separate system. Yeah.

Lenny (00:42:49):
So people listening to this made feel like, "Hey, I don't have Kevin Rose announcing my podcast. How do I get started? How do I get my initial traction in my podcast?" Do you have any advice there for people that are just launching things they could do to get their initial set of subscribers and get the word out and get some kind of traction without a friend with a huge platform?

Chris Hutchins (00:43:08):
Yes. I interviewed a guy named Nick Gray, and it was a fun conversation because he wrote a book called The 2-Hour Cocktail Party, and it was all about how to build relationships by throwing the best cocktail parties. And it was very tactical guide, but one of the things he does is he has a friend's newsletter. And he basically created a newsletter and every time he meets someone that is a friend of his, he sends him a note, says, "Can I add you to my friend's newsletter?" People say, yes. And he just shares, "Here's some cool articles I'm reading. Here's a cool thing I'm doing in my life. Here's a picture." It's instead of waiting till the holidays to send your holiday card to everyone that's like, "Here's what happened this year. Or maybe now we've..." That's what my grandparents did. Now it's just like, "Here's a photo of the family."

(00:43:45):
He just sends it out. I don't even know what the cadence is. It's just like every now and then I get an email and it's like, "Oh, this what Nick's up to, this is pretty cool." Anyone can subscribe to it. And he shares all these great things. He's like, "Ah, I was thinking about a virtual assistant. Here's 75 things that I dreamed up that I could send to a virtual assistant." I was like, "That's really cool." "Here's how I tweak my Calendly. And I sent the Calendly to you. It's like I added a few little things in it that..." He had suggestions to just make it a little more friendly, make it a little more comfortable. The one I loved was like, "If I'm not arrived within two minutes of the start time, here is my cell phone number. I just want to make sure I'm prompt. And people know that."

(00:44:19):
And so, one thing is, before you even get started, find a way to just build an audience of your closest friends, family, colleagues, and throw stuff out in the world. You don't have to do it weekly or monthly. You could just send it out every quarter, every six months, it doesn't matter. But start to build something. So I started with a new, I think it was on MailChimp, called Life Updates. And I think I sent five of these out 10 years ago, and I hadn't really sent one out in seven years, but I still had this email newsletter with 1100 people on it that I just collected from life. And so that was one thing. Look, you can always go out and try to find other creative ways to partner with people. So you have a newsletter, but you don't have a podcast.

(00:45:03):
Could you use your newsletter to promote something? Could you find someone who has a platform that you could trade your services for promotional things? Yeah, I can think of any couple examples where there's been something where I've been really excited use and I'm like, "Hey, could I talk to my audience about this thing? And then you could let me use this?" So if there's anything, whether it's consulting services or anything, you could maybe trade those services for other people with an audience to share and promote you. I think that happens more often than not. But again, it all matters if you have good content. So I'd say the first thing, the most important thing to grow a piece of content is just have it be good. And it's hard to know what's good. Put it out in the world, see if people like it. Maybe get your reps in before you even try some of these growth things.

(00:45:46):
I think I was fortunate to have done some public speaking before, so I felt a little more comfortable. But if you... You mentioned MrBeast earlier, he's very public about the fact, if you go back 10 years and look at his YouTube videos, they were not exciting like they are now. And it took him a long time. And I think that's the reality with content is, for almost every person that you see out there and you're like, "Wow, they have this huge audience. It's so awesome." You go back 10 years and you're like, "Oh, well their first episode wasn't that awesome. It was actually kind of crazy. Or it wasn't that interesting. And they got better over time. They learned what their audience liked, they built a following." So those things are all there. Find communities. If you're talking about a very specific thing, I never forgot Gary Vaynerchuk's lesson, gosh, he probably told me this 13 years ago.

(00:46:32):
He was like, "When he was starting Wine Library." Which most people don't maybe even know that that's what he was originally known for. He wanted to build this business and so he went on Twitter and he looked for every single person that asked a question about wine and he at replied them back. And so a tactic that I think could work really well is, for me, I'm like, "I love travel. I love points and miles." I can just search Twitter and find every person on Twitter, every person on Reddit, every person on a forum, whatever that's asking a question about the thing my podcast answers, and go in and try to be a value add to them. I guarantee that if you have a podcast and your favorite thing is quilting and in your bio on Twitter, maybe Twitter's not the right platform, but let's just go with the analogy, right?

(00:47:14):
Your bio says , "Top quilting podcast." And you go find everyone that's asking questions about quilting and answer their questions with strong, good answers. They're going to look at your bio and be like, "Oh my gosh, this person knows their stuff about this topic. Let's go see what they do." And you have these advocates they share in their communities and it grows over time. I'll come back to one more tactic, which I didn't do, but there's no built-in distribution engine in podcasting. TikTok, you make a TikTok video, TikTok sends it to like a hundred people and if no one likes it dies. But if like a few people like it, they send it to more people and more people. And YouTube does the same thing. Instagram Reels does the same thing. Podcasting doesn't have that, and so it's just a slow growth effort and you just have to be okay with that.

(00:47:59):
But what I didn't do early on, which you can do is you can make clips of your podcast and you could put those clips on these channels that do have that built in distribution. And if those clips do take off, they could build a massive audience. And so there's a guy, Danny Miranda, he has a podcast and he launched, didn't have a huge following, but he created clips of every single episode, lots of clips. He didn't know what was the most interesting piece of content, so he made a clip for everything. He built millions and millions of views on TikTok and Instagram, just by creating content from his podcast that drove downloads over to his podcast. Helped him build his audience, and he built an audience on social faster than I have a and bigger than I currently have out of just being all in on distributing his content on platforms that had growth engines built into it.

Lenny (00:48:48):
The last point is interesting because what I've been hearing, and I've actually experienced it, so I have TikTok clips, I have YouTube videos and YouTube shorts, and I find they drive followers within the platform and downloads and views, but I haven't seen any actual impact on the podcast. And maybe people can measure it or maybe they can tell something's happening, but from what I hear and what I've seen, I don't know if it actually drives a lot of downloads, but it's still really useful, still useful to have an awesome TikTok account and an awesome YouTube account.

Chris Hutchins (00:49:16):
He said, "Look..." I don't know if it drives downloads, but it drives brand awareness for me.

Lenny (00:49:20):
Yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:49:20):
And he's had multiple guests be like, "Oh yeah, I'd love to go on your show." One of the clips he made, he made a clip talking about Ray Dalio. And Ray Dalio was like reposting his clip. And so he was getting a lot of engagement with people that would be very difficult to reach out to saying, "I have this many downloads." But because he was getting thousands or even millions of views across a platform, it gave him the credibility to do a lot of things that he might not have been able to do now. Then he's gone and translated that into, "Well, let's go bring some of these people with really, really wide distribution of their podcast onto my show and let's do an interview with them." Then for the most part, people are like, "Oh, let's distribute that content to my audience that you had me on."

(00:50:03):
One thing he did that was so good is he did all of his videos in person, so he would fly to someone record in person, and the quality of the video for an in-person video was just so much better than you get doing a remote thing. It's a lot harder. It's a lot more work and it doesn't even impact the audio, but he would make the best quality clips, and Erika Colberg does the same thing. And she would deliver them and he would deliver them to the guests, and now the guest starts using those clips because he spent so much time trying to come up with the best clips, the highest quality, best produced that made his guests look amazing. And then those guests were much more likely to share those in their audiences and all of a sudden you've got a lot of momentum.

(00:50:44):
Does that translate to downloads? I'll give you a little shout-out, Danny has a paid newsletter on Substack where he actually breaks down all his downloads and all his tactics on how this is all working for him. And it's fascinating, it's called In The DM, because he did a lot of his early on recruiting with guests in DMS on social media. But it's to be seen, how much of an impact it can have on your podcast, but it certainly builds other things that are, I'd say like indirect... There's no direct attribution, but that doesn't mean that things aren't overall going up. And then the last one is finding other podcasts that you can go on as an expert in some area. So hopefully, you're starting a podcast because you believe something is exciting in the world, you love it, you have a passion about it, you're an expert in it.

(00:51:32):
Take that thing and go present yourself to other podcasts. And they all have listeners that are listening to podcasts, so it's the best medium. Because yes, someone who likes short form, 60-second videos is maybe not the best target demo to listen to a one-hour audio only thing, those two are very different behaviors. But if you can find something you're really good at and present a value add to people to come on their show, then that could help you build your audience while adding value to their audience. And I think as someone who gets a lot of pitches from people to come on their podcast, I will only caveat it with, do the work to make sure you're really presenting a compelling pitch. You're going to get a lot of nos, that's just how it works. I've pitched myself to go on lots of shows and sometimes I get nos also.

(00:52:19):
Many times I get nos, but I never send an email that's like someone would read it and be like, "This person obviously, doesn't know what they're talking about." But I get so many, they're like, "Oh, I'd love to have my client come on your podcast. They love talking about building a business." And I was like, "Well, I don't really interview people about that." If someone came to me and was like, "Here is a tactic to improve your life that I think your audience would benefit from and here's why my expertise makes me the best person to talk about it." I'd be much more open to it because they actually understood what my show is about.

Lenny (00:52:51):
Yeah, I get it. At least, one email a day with one of these pitches and I know exactly what you mean. I generally, don't reply because it's just not even worth trying to convince them they're not a fit.

Chris Hutchins (00:53:00):
Yes.

Lenny (00:53:01):
Shifting gears a little bit, I want to talk about your stack, your podcasting stack. What do you use on the software? What do you use the hardware? Mic, headphones. What do you recommend?

Chris Hutchins (00:53:11):
On a mic? I started out with the ATR2100X, I think it is a great entry level mic. It's under a $100. You can use old analog XLR cables if you want, but it's also USB. That mic got me through 50 episodes. I have since upgraded to a Shure SM7B, which is the XLR compatriot to, I think you have a Shure MB7.

Lenny (00:53:36):
Yeah, I have the USB version if that's what-

Chris Hutchins (00:53:38):
Yeah, exactly. And those are two great kind of upgrade mics that I think... I like the sound quality a little better, but every time I'm traveling and I'm not sure if something's going to come up, if I can make a recording and if I have to record the intro, do a remote interview, I still carry the ATR2100X, because I just think it's an easy thing to have and it works really well. I record everything on Riverside. I put everything into Descript. I plug my XLR mic into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, which is like a audio interface. I would say I've gone a little bit overboard with video, so we were talking right before this started. I have a Sony a7C, which is like a mirrorless, full frame camera behind a $60 Amazon teleprompter so that I can make direct eye contact with the camera while an iPad that's... I don't know, it's like 10-year-old iPad sits under it and projects as a second screen for my computer, using this-

Lenny (00:54:36):
[inaudible 00:54:36] If you're not watching this YouTube, you got to check out the YouTube video at least for five seconds to see Chris just staring at you. I've never seen this on a podcast video before.

Chris Hutchins (00:54:43):
Yeah,

Lenny (00:54:44):
It's the future.

Chris Hutchins (00:54:45):
So I have that set up using a iPad, running an app called Duet Display. I don't do the editing. I've worked with one editor that uses Audition and one that uses Pro Tools. I don't have a strong opinion there. Oh, my favorite of all, my friend of mine, Brendan Mulligan, started this company called Podpage. And so for people who don't know a lot about how podcasting works, there's a hosting platform, I use Simple Cast. I liked that they were one of the only hosting platforms that has a really affordable self-serve option, but also has a really great pro, all the features that you would want in the future for monetization, everything so that you wouldn't have to switch. Not to say that you know couldn't switch easily, it's pretty easy to switch. How it works is you upload an MP3 file, you write out all your show notes, the title of the episode, everything, and they create an RSS feed for you.

(00:55:36):
You could literally just create an RSS feed, right? That's all it really is, and you could host everything on your own on AWS or something, but they make it really easy for not that much money. And then you go distribute that RSS feed to all of these different players, so the Apple Podcast app, Spotify, et cetera. And one of the things that's amazing is this site Podpage, you submit the RSS feed to this website and they go in and say, "Oh, here's the description of the podcast. Here's each episode. Here's the cover art you submitted for that episode. Here's the title, here's the show notes." And they just auto-generate a website for you. And then they give you the tools like a WordPress style set of tools to go and change the header, change the descriptions. They're like, "You could go in and tweak things." But every night on Wednesday, or I guess Wednesday morning at 2:00 AM my podcast goes live. And at 2:05 Podpage has already noticed, the RSS feed is up-to-date and that site is posted. I don't have to do anything.

(00:56:30):
They even monitor for the slug, like the URL slug I put in as a checkout. This podcast at this URL and podcast page says, "Oh, that's the URL you want them to check out. We're going to inherit that and put it in so you don't even have to give us any information. And we'll just know the URL that you want to set this episode up on." I think that is a super simple way to build a podcasting website. The only other thing, we didn't talk at all about analytics at all, but I use Chartable for analytics. And podcast analytics are a little crazy because you don't have a lot to go on. But Chartable is a really cool analytics platform that becomes really interesting when you start to cross promo with other shows or run ads for other shows or do anything like that because they basically can track IP address of downloads.

(00:57:22):
And I say track, I don't know who's listening to what from where in any kind of very specific way. But what I do know is if I'm doing a cross promo with another show where I'm saying, "Hey, check out a podcast I love." And they're saying, "Check out a podcast I love." It actually says, "Oh, how many of the people that downloaded this episode actually went and listened to this other episode?" So you can get direct attribution of podcast listeners going from one podcast to another. So that is a really important tool in my kind of running a podcast toolkit, but it doesn't matter as much until you start focusing on growth and doing promotions and stuff like that.

Lenny (00:57:58):
Awesome. I host on Substack as maybe one difference. I use Podpage for my site, my producer/editor people actually use Descript/Descript also. That's kind of what they use for editing professionally, so it's good for amateur hour and good for professionals as well. I use Chartable, something's up with my Chartable, I think I've told you, or it doesn't count my Spotify downloads. It's kind of a pain in the butt, but it's still-

Chris Hutchins (00:58:21):
Which is funny by the way, because for anyone listening doesn't know, Spotify actually owns Chartable. So the one platform your Chartable doesn't get good download data from, is the one that it is owned by.

Lenny (00:58:33):
Yep. I do not understand what is going on. I've talked to them and they don't know what the fix is. It doesn't matter anyway. I get enough analytics other places. There's one other site I'd recommend called Podstatus that just gives you quick access to where you're on the charts every day, gives you these cool line charts. Which Chartable sort of does, but it's a lot simpler on Podstatus. But otherwise-

Chris Hutchins (00:58:53):
Awesome.

Lenny (00:58:53):
All the same stuff. One other question real quick. Say someone launches their podcast, what would be a good download goal to aim for, when you're getting started that's like, "Maybe this is working." Do you have a sense of a threshold try to hit?

Chris Hutchins (00:59:08):
I wouldn't think of a threshold to hit because you could launch with a huge audience and have a terrible podcast and you might hit 10,000 downloads and it would be crazy, right? You would feel really good. So I would care more about the direction than about the number because even the Apple charts, they're more momentum driven. You could have one download, but the next week you have a lot more and a lot more and a lot more. You would actually rise in the charts faster than someone whose podcast is kind of stagnant doing X number of downloads. If you have 3000 downloads an episode or something like that, you're in the top 1% or something. So you know, don't have to get to crazy numbers to be in the top of the charts.

Lenny (00:59:08):
Yeah, I heard-

Chris Hutchins (00:59:08):
I would say-

Lenny (00:59:54):
I heard a similar number, 3000.

Chris Hutchins (00:59:55):
The top podcasts are doing millions in episode, but that's like top 10, top 20, top 30. The next tranche of the top 50 are doing probably hundreds of thousands of downloads. But outside of the top two, 300, it's in the 10,000s of downloads per episode. And this is a little bit variable if you have a daily show or a weekly show or something. But I would say if you cross 10,000 downloads an episode, you are now taken seriously by a lot of people. So I had conversations early on with networks like iHeartMedia and different podcast networks that wanted to bring in the show and would do all that, and that all started at 10 to 15, maybe 20,000 downloads an episode. But by no means would I expect anyone to get there right away. Even I didn't get there right away. It took time even with a few friends to make announcements and stuff, it took time.

(01:00:50):
So forget how many downloads you get on your first three episodes because you're probably going to tell everyone in the world and you're going to use all your social capital to boost those. And then look at how many downloads you get on your fourth and fifth and sixth and does it go up? Does it stay stagnant? Apple and Spotify actually give you really cool data about how long people are listening. Do they drop off halfway through? You could start to be like, "Oh, do people stay for the whole episode?" I will say I haven't found a good site for benchmarks, but it's like the average podcast I think probably has less than 50% of listeners by the end. So don't be turned off when you say, "Wow, only 40% of people made it to the end." That's not horrible. I think my best episode, it might be like 65 or 70% of people made it all the way to the end. It's not 99.

Lenny (01:01:37):
What I like about those charts is you can see what percentage of people skip the ads and then just keep continuing. It's like a bump-

Chris Hutchins (01:01:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:42):
The mid-rolls and the-

Chris Hutchins (01:01:44):
[inaudible 01:01:44] And it's not as high as I thought.

Lenny (01:01:46):
10, 20% depending on-

Chris Hutchins (01:01:47):
Maybe 15%. It depends.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Yeah. Not bad at all.

Chris Hutchins (01:01:51):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:51):
Any last words of wisdom on the world of podcasting? Starting a podcast? Continuing a podcast?

Chris Hutchins (01:01:57):
Yeah, I've got three things for you. One, this is a little bit of a financial outlay, but I think it's really interesting. There's this podcast app called Overcast, and it's not the biggest in the world, but you can run ads in it. And the thing I like is that the ads are much more reasonably priced than a lot of other places and they're very dynamic. So I would encourage anyone listening to watch it for a few weeks if you have a podcast and you want to experiment, because the same ad could be $200 one week and $700 the next week depending on how much demand there is for that category. So you can wait and hold out. But what I like is they take your art from your podcast and then you can rewrite your description and they tell you how many people saw the ad, how many people tapped on it, and how many people subscribed to the podcast after seeing the ad.

(01:02:43):
And technically they could also listen to the trailer, they could listen to an episode. And they even give you benchmarks of what to expect. So for a few hundred dollars, you could go in and run an ad for your podcast. Now, I would say in all of the experiments I've done with them, I've probably garnered... I'm looking at some numbers, like hundreds of subscribers, not thousands. And I've probably spent maybe a $1,000. The average cost to acquire a podcast listener, if you're doing paid marketing is about anywhere from three to $10 depending on the appeal of your show, what kind of audience? I'm sure it could go way over that for a business show. And by business I mean, B2B focused kind of show. So, let's call it $5. So it's not going to be the best way to grow your audience. At some point, if you're at enough scale that you have ads in your show and how much a customer's worth, maybe it makes sense to pay $5 because your LTV of a podcast listener is $7. But getting it started, that's not you.

(01:03:39):
What you can do is say, "Okay, what was my click-through rate on the ad?" Which will tell you if someone doesn't click, it's either not a good description or it's not a good set of content, or your cover art's not good. So you can think about, "Okay, I actually need to figure out the podcast before I even have content." And you could run this ad with a trailer before you even record anything. And then it's like, "Okay, well people tapped on it, how many of them subscribed?" And I like to use this as a way to say, "Okay, well the benchmark said I was going to get about 50 subscriptions for this ad that was going to get a thousand taps and I got seven." So these aren't people who weren't interested. These are people who read the description, were like, this is interesting, and they didn't subscribe.

(01:04:20):
That means my content probably sucks. That means someone listened to a trailer or an episode or something more than the description in the image and decided, "This is not for me." Maybe they looked at your episodes, I don't know. But if they don't tap on it, if you're supposed to get a 2% click-through rate and you get 0.5, then it's actually the topic or the way I describe it or the cover sucks. And so I like that as a way to, for a few hundred dollars, get a good test. I've even thought of running an AB test of the same podcast with two different descriptions. I wish you could do it with two different cover arts. So I don't know, that's like a cheap way to do a little bit of testing. One other thing that I'll share is I just try to share the podcast everywhere.

(01:05:05):
So you've probably noticed that in all of my emails at the bottom, it's like, "Oh, great, talk to you Chris." And then it says, "Hey, want to upgrade your life, money or travel? Check out my podcast and newsletter." I'm taking every opportunity I can to let anyone know about it because you never know it'll happen. And my favorite example, especially, when it's written that it doesn't come across a big bulky signature was we bought some floor mats and one of them didn't fit. And I was going back and forth with the customer service person and they actually replied and they were like, "Oh, thanks for sending me that podcast. I really appreciate it." They thought I was just randomly telling them, "Hey, if you want to upgrade your life, check this out." They didn't know it was my signature. So I got a new listener from customer service from a floor mat company. Which by the way, here's one hack that I also learned from the floor mat company.

(01:05:52):
Come to my show for hacks, but if you're ever trying to get a deal on something, that floor mat company, I just pulled up the live chat and just asked. And I said, "Hey, I'm looking at these floor mats, think you could give me a discount. It's a little expensive." And it was like, "Yeah, refresh your cart. It'll be 15% off." So, this episode's not about all the hacks, but there's one cool one.

Lenny (01:06:11):
We need more hacks. Wait, I think we'll get to that at the end. Keep going.

Chris Hutchins (01:06:14):
And then the last is, I think it's fun, that podcast you can experiment. I started out doing guests and then I did some Q&A episodes from questions listeners asked me, and then I recently did some solo episodes. I was really interested in the idea of all the ways you can rent and swap and exchange your home to stay in vacation homes around the world. So I just researched it for, I don't know, two or three days and just did a 45-minute episode of me talking. There was no guest, there were no questions, it was just me talking. And that works. I'm going to start another series of episodes where instead of interviewing people about an expertise topic, I'm going to interview people who are really dialed into a country. So I've got a guy who's written a handful of the Lonely Planet guidebook for Japan and is in Japan right now for three weeks getting dialed in, what are the latest, coolest stuff.

(01:07:03):
He's going to come back and we're just going to record an episode about everything you need to know about going to Japan. And I'm going to add on about 15 minutes I think at the end without him, where I just talk about all the tricks for using your points, your miles, deals and discounts. Like there's this new airline in LA that's super cheap to fly to Japan, but it comes with some caveats. So it'll be like two thirds guide to going to Japan, one third guide to getting there for cheap. And there aren't a lot of businesses or ideas where you could just have all of these things that you can experiment with.

Lenny (01:07:35):
And then you could do them so fast. Yeah,

Chris Hutchins (01:07:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:35):
I love that.

Chris Hutchins (01:07:37):
If I interview you, which I'm doing right after this, so anyone listening to this that wants to hear a little of Lenny's story, come check out All the Hacks. And for 20 minutes we talk about some topic that's a little off topic. I've sometimes just taken that it's submitted it as a bonus episode on Friday. 15, 20 minutes, it's not my regular show, but there's so many ways you can experiment and find out what you like. And then you might say, "Wow, you know what? I really like doing the solo things." Or maybe you have a co-host on for a week and you're like, "Ah, that's so much better."

(01:08:07):
So I just love that it gives you a good opportunity to experiment with stuff, find the thing you love, because I think my big takeaway is once you find the thing you really love to talk about, all of that, it just makes everything so much easier because it's natural and you would do it for free. And the harsh reality of this whole game is like there's probably going to be a number of months or years you have to do it for free before it takes off. So if you don't love it, that's going to be a painful few years.

Lenny (01:08:31):
To build on that, I find the same thing with a newsletter, same with a podcast. The last thing you want to do is create a job for yourself that you hate. And so picking a topic that is just not interesting to you, picking a medium that is painful to you, there's no reason to do that. You may become a TikTok star and you hit a viral video, but then you have to make viral videos for the rest of your life. That's no fun. You have to think about, "Do I want to do this for years and years and years." And you can stop, but then becomes hard if it becomes a really good source of income. So that's something to think about, just don't create a job for yourself that you just don't want.

Chris Hutchins (01:08:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:07):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I don't know if you knew this was coming. So it'll be extra special, real quick, easy, whatever comes to mind, let me know, and then we'll see how it all goes. Does that sound good?

Chris Hutchins (01:09:18):
That sounds good.

Lenny (01:09:19):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people recently or in life in general?

Chris Hutchins (01:09:26):
Two, I love. Actually, this could be three, Happy Money is a fantastic book. All about ways that you can spend your money to optimize for happiness. It's like a collection of a ton of research about the science of happier spending, so that's one. Vagabonding by Rolf Potts, who I had the pleasure... The last two I've had the pleasure of interviewing recently. It's like a guide to long-term travel, but it's just kind of a different perspective on travel. I would say if you're at the point in your life where you now have kids, it's probably going to be hard to live up to that. But I have gifted that book to so many people who are like, "Oh, I think I should take a trip for six months." I'm like, "Go read this book." My wife and I travel around the World for seven months, and that book was instrumental to us taking it and how we lived on that.

(01:10:09):
And then the last is called Die with Zero by Bill Perkins. And that book probably had the biggest impact. I haven't gifted it to anyone. I've recommended it heavily the last week because it had a huge impact on me. And the fundamental premise of the book is that, this isn't very lightning round response, but instead of optimizing for money, which is so tied up in American culture of how do I make more, how do I get promoted? How do I earn more money, how do I save more money? We should really be optimizing for the net fulfillment in life, and we shouldn't be trying to save all of this money. We should actually be trying to allocate it over our lives in the most optimal way to increase experiences, increase fulfillment, increase happiness. And sometimes that means saving less when you're younger and you're more able to do things like backpack around the world for seven months or go bungee jumping. And when you build those experiences early on, the memories of those experience pay dividends, the rest of your life.

Lenny (01:11:04):
Good choices. What's a favorite other podcast, other than your podcast and my podcast?

Chris Hutchins (01:11:10):
I love Animal Spirits. If you're into markets, life and investing. And they always have good recommendations at the end also on podcasts, TV shows, books, movies, that kind of stuff. So that's one I really like.

Lenny (01:11:23):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Chris Hutchins (01:11:28):
A show that I love, which I think is kind of like a version of a show called Silicon Valley, but not, it's called Mythic Quests on Apple TV. And I haven't heard enough people talking about this that I felt like maybe it's a hidden gem. Maybe I'm amongst company of watching this show, but I think it's a funny show. It's lighthearted, it makes me happy, and hopefully at least a few people haven't checked it out. But it's like a startup life show, but just dragged out to the extreme like Silicon Valley was.

Lenny (01:11:55):
What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask on your podcast?

Chris Hutchins (01:12:00):
I like to try to ask people about their favorite misconceptions in a space. Yeah, I like to kick things off usually with, "What's a thing that you kind of have a contrarian take on or you think most people get wrong about the thing that best?"

Lenny (01:12:13):
Awesome. Final question. What are your three favorite money hacks that listeners can take action on soon?

Chris Hutchins (01:12:23):
Okay. One that has paid dividends and literally, I've had people on a podcast telling them, write back to me, guests that are like, "I just saved money." So go to your state's unclaimed money website. Every state has one, and you can go put in your name, state or city, you don't even have to give your address. And you can find whether there are people that owe you money. And oftentimes they're businesses like you moved and Comcast couldn't figure out how to get you the final part of your prepaid month. And I had someone message me the other day and they're like, "I just listened to you talk about unclaimed money on a podcast, and I just found $136. I've never gotten paid to listen to a podcast." People have saved hundreds, some people, thousands. I always say, if you're going to dinner party, you now know someone's address.

(01:13:07):
You probably know their name instead of bringing a bottle of wine or in addition, just check if they have unclaimed money. I brought over to a bottle of wine to someone's house and said, "Also, by the way, did you know that this pharmaceutical company owes you $200?" And I showed him how to go claim it and boom, free money. What a great conversation for the dinner table. So that's one great one I love. Another great one, you can't use it right now unless you have a trip planned. But anytime you're booking a hotel book directly with the hotel and email the hotel in advance that, "Hey, we booked. We're really excited to stay with you." If you're celebrating something, let them know. And if you can't get the email address, just call the front desk, ask for an email address, follow up a couple days before you get there, let them know you're coming.

(01:13:51):
And I would say, you've got a 50% chance of getting an upgrade, getting a bottle of wine, getting some comped something, getting a better view. One person wrote into me letting me know that the hotel had their initials embroidered on their pillow, which I thought was kind of a crazy thing to have happen. It's never happened to me. Personally, I'd rather have the bottle of wine, but I'll take that for what it is. And for people who like the points game, I'll share something. Just give you a little tease of how I love finding all the points and miles optimizations. If you have a credit card that pays multiple points, three, four, or five x points on things like a grocery store or an office supply store, anything like that, drug stores, that's great. You probably don't have a card that pays any multiple of points on home improvements or Home Depot, Lowes.

(01:14:41):
So what I like to do to make sure I get the most points I can, instead of going to Home Depot and paying with a card that's going to give me one point per dollar at Home Depot. I have a four x grocery card. I like to go to Safeway and I just buy Home Depot gift cards. I get my four x points on the gift cards, then I go buy stuff at Home Depot knowing that I got four x points. But you also have some cards that give you three or four x points, if you go to CVS or other pharmacies or drug stores, you can do it there. You can do it at Office Supply stores if you want to take it to the next extreme. If you have an Amazon card, you could buy Amazon gift cards and get your five x or 5% back on the Amazon Prime card.

(01:15:20):
So I'm a little crazy like that. My favorite is if you're trying to buy something at a store, always shop online for coupons. If you Google like Lowes, Home Depot, Crate & Barrel coupons, there's all these websites. My favorite one is Save n, the letter, deals.com. You could buy Home Depot and Crate & Barrel coupons online for a couple bucks, save 15%. So stack up and then the cashback portals. I'm going to buy something, I'm like, "How do I get the cashback portal? How do I get the most points per dollar on my card? And how do I get a discount maybe from asking in the live chat or going in and buying a coupon." So I go a little crazy on that stuff, but I love saving money and just feeling like I got a good deal.

Lenny (01:16:03):
Amazing. What an action packed episode we had. We got money hacks, we got big bets, we got podcasting, we got Self-Driving Money. What a conversation. Chris, this was amazing. Two last questions. How do folks find you online, where do they find your podcast? And then how can folks be useful to you?

Chris Hutchins (01:16:24):

How can you be helpful to me? Check out the show. Let me know what you think. Let me know what you like. Let me know what topics you want me to focus on optimizing in the future. I've mentioned I'm always trying to make stuff that someone's favorite, so if there are things you want to hear me go deep on, let me know. I'm just chris@allthehacks.com and I try to respond to everyone in some reasonable amount of time. And if I haven't responded in a couple weeks, nudge me and remind me. But I'd love to hear from you.

# The essence of product management | Christian Idiodi (SVPG)

## Transcript

Christian Idiodi (00:00:00):
I try to explain to people that the real essence of this job is that you wake up on behalf of someone else to solve a problem for them, and you have to do it well enough that they give you something back in return. That's kind of the real essence of it, and that's, I always call it a certificate of appreciation. And it could be in the form of revenue, engagement, loyalty, reference, all of those things. And that's the real essence of this job. If it's not fun, you're probably not doing it right. If it's not had, you're probably also not doing it right.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Today, my guest is Christian Idiodi. Christian is a partner at Silicon Valley Product Group, alongside Marty Cagan, who when he introduced us, called Christian the most interesting man in the world. After meeting him, I tend to agree. After a long career in product, Christian now spends his time working closely with companies, big and small, implementing and improving their discipline of product management. In our conversation, we discuss why the product management field is so often disliked and what you can do to avoid becoming a product manager people don't want on their team. We spend a lot of time on coaching, how to get better at coaching your reports, how to get better coaching from your manager, and some really clever tactics for building trust with leaders within your company. Also, Christian shares his one favorite go-to method, out of all of the discovery methods out there, for figuring out what to build.

(00:01:23):
Also, we spend some time on the great work that he's doing at Silicon Valley, Product Group. He's been doing a lot of great work on the product management field in Africa to help product builders and founders build great companies. That and so much more Christian is awesome. With that, I bring you Christian Idiodi, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:38):
You fell in love with building products for a reason. But sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

Christian Idiodi (00:04:03):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. It's a joy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:06):
It's a joy to have you here. So Marty Cagan introduced us, a colleague of yours at Silicon Valley Product Group. And the way he described you is he considers you the most interesting man in the world. Did you know that that's how he thinks about you?

Christian Idiodi (00:04:18):
I didn't. I consider him one of the most interesting people in the world too.

Lenny (00:04:22):
You guys are so kind to each other. I wanted to start with this trend I've been noticing in product management and the perception of product management. It feels like, I don't know if this is new or if it's always been around, but it feels like there's this trend of people just not liking product managers. There's trend of founders feeling like they should wait a long time to hire their first product manager. There's a lot of teams that wish they didn't have a product manager in their team. We don't have this person telling us what to do. I'm curious just why you think there's often this dislike of product managers. And then for PMs listening, do you have any advice for just how to not become a product manager people don't like and don't want on their team?

Christian Idiodi (00:04:59):
I think most people don't like product managers often because they haven't experienced good product managers. The core of product management is competency-based, meaning there is someone in an organization that represents the customer the best, that has a deep knowledge of the customers and your users, that has a deep knowledge of your data, your industry, your business and the product itself. And because of this competence, you kind of trust them to make decisions because if you have a problem that says, say we want more customers, it makes a lot of sense to go to the person that is an expert in customers to say, "Help me solve this problem." What you see happening in many organizations is that there is kind of this misperception displaced influence and mistrust because of the poor competency, meaning I feel I know more about the business or I know more about the customer or the data. And so why should I not tell you what to do?

(00:06:03):
And I think people fail to understand that this role is, it's a team spot. They are part of a team of people working together to discover a solution we're building and in a way that works for our company. And so I think when I think through the companies I've worked with, where I see this discipline really eroded is where there is just not a competent level of product management. The way I describe it to a CEO, I'll ask him, "Tell me who you trust in your company to make a decision on what markets we go to, what things we do." And they always have some senior leader, some VP, some person. And I say, "Why? Oh, Bob has been here a long time. He knows everybody. Everybody loves him and trusts him. He understands our business." And I often say to him, I say, "Well, Bob said put up manager." And it's often interesting to executives when I try to explain that way. I say that's the competent level that we're talking about here.

(00:07:01):
Imagine if you had Bob's on every team. Imagine how much you can accomplish. So one, I don't really think it's... I often say it's not the hate for product management, it's a hate for the understanding of what they have experienced in product management, which are people that are not able to deliver results that help them meet the outcomes they want.

(00:07:23):
So if I were advising product managers, I often say, look, when we see sales or executive driven product management where we see these alternatives to product management, it's not a cultural knock or a leadership knock, it's really on the individual and the discipline has to elevate itself to a place that it earns the right to make a decision on what we do.

Lenny (00:07:45):
I have exactly the same perspective. When people say they don't like product managers, exactly what I tell them is, you just haven't worked with a great product manager. A great PM makes everything easier for you. If you want to be a PM, people would hate to lose on their team. I would never want to lose Christian on my team as a PM. Is there something they could do maybe or change to become that person?

Christian Idiodi (00:08:06):
Well, I was just joking with someone earlier. I said, "I've only seen great product managers come out of two places. One, either a series of massive failure in their career or experiences that have been bad or from learning from great product leaders." The reality of this kind of role, it's kind of like if you have all kinds of... maybe you're like on a sport, like a quarterback on a team, you need to practice product management to be good at product management. You're not going to get mastery by avoiding some of these elements.

(00:08:39):
And we've kind of clearly defined what you need to represent to a company for them to trust you. So there is this period of humility that I challenge all product managers to have, this period of learning, recognizing what you do not know. And what you do not have is the trust of an organization or even in yourself that you know the customer, the business or the data better than anybody else. What you need to do is quickly try to accelerate that. You're going to find the loudest, most influential person in your organization, the person that everybody knows, knows everything, is in every meeting and stuff, and you're going to ask them to teach you. You're going to challenge them. And if they don't have the time to teach you, you're going to volunteer to help them. I'm going to intern for you. You're going to get permission from your manager and say, "Look, I want to spend time with Lenny. He's the head of sales, he's the head of operations and stuff. I just want to learn from him."

(00:09:35):
Now, what you're doing is you're extending that person's trust to yourself. You're also building a relationship with that person. But more importantly, you're learning what is driving that person's influence, which is their competence in the business or the customer.

(00:09:51):
After you've done that, you have to keep doing discovery because what's going to be different now is that person knows they've taught you everything that they know, but everybody now sees you learning every single day. So at some point, people will recognize that you might have more insights and more data than anybody else, and they will only know this because they've seen you learn from the best and they've seen you continuing to learn. So I always practically advise product managers in this kind of scenario, build relationships with people. You earn their trust by asking them to do two things. One, you're either going to teach me or I'm going to help you. And you're going to build relationships there, gain experience with them. You've got to immerse yourself in the deeper understanding of the business and the data.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Wow, there's a lot there. Because this is awesome. This is exactly, I think what people want to hear is how do you become better and how do you become more trusted and respected? So things you're recommending to PMs that want to become better, less disliked, more successful. I just took some notes as you were talking. One is there's a sense of becoming more full stack in the company, like understand the business, not just there's your one product and here's your one goal. And then this idea of just be always learning, which is both you are learning things and also people see that you're learning and see that you really care about a lot of the parts of the business that maybe you wouldn't naturally be inclined to understand. And that also helps you build relationships. And also just this really important point of if you know more than anyone else, people will innately trust you and respect you and want you on the team because you happen to have a lot of answers.

Christian Idiodi (00:11:25):
Yes.

Lenny (00:11:26):
Awesome. Kind of on a similar thread, something that Silicon Valley product group has is a really good definition of what a product manager's job is. And I thought it'd be cool just to spend a little time here. There's these four attributes you guys like to share. Can you just talk about that, as a little foundational?

Christian Idiodi (00:11:40):
I kind of mentioned before, a product manager is in a team spor., so they work as part of a team to uncover a solution, what to build. And every time you solve a problem, there's inherent risk involved. There's the risk of will people buy this or will they choose it or will they choose to use it, which is all a value type of risk. There's the risk of can they use it, which is a usability type of risk. The risk that we can build it to have the skills to build it or the time to build this, that's a feasibility risk.

(00:12:14):
And the risk of it working for our business, which is a viability risk. I cannot call out the product manager's competency. It's really to try to drive the first and the last one, which is value and viability. A solution worth building, something people will buy, choose or use, and one that works for our business, which is at the core of what product teams do, solve a problem in a way customers will love and a way that works for our business. It's why the product manager gets all the rap of, if everything goes great, a great team effort, if everything goes wrong, they blame the product manager.

(00:12:49):
It's because people hold them accountable to results. Nobody wants to work on something nobody wanted in the first place and your job is to ensure that we are working on something people want in the first place. And it is such an amazing role. I try to explain to people that the real essence of this job is that you wake up on behalf of someone else to solve a problem for them. And what an amazing job. There's just no greater... I cannot think of a better discipline with such inherent permission to solve problems on behalf of someone. And you have to do it well enough that they give you something back in return. That's the real essence of it, and that's the, I always call it a certificate of appreciation. And it could be in the form of revenue, engagement, loyalty, reference, all of those things. And that's the real essence of this job. If it's not fun, you're probably not doing it right. If it's not hard, you're probably also not doing it right.

Lenny (00:13:51):
Wow, I love that frame of reference of you're giving something to customers and your success is measured by do they give something back in return, which is basically do they pay for your product? Such a beautiful way to think about that. Oh, man.

(00:14:05):
Okay. So just to summarize these four elements, there's value, usability, viability, feasibility to understand if the product they're building hits all these attributes.

Christian Idiodi (00:14:15):
That's right. You're trying to uncover a solution and you know you've solved the problem when you get those two things, something customers love, they give you something back, and our business can support it in some ways. And I'm calling out, these are the different risks in our kind of taxonomy, how we call the things you have to tackle. And it's a team sport, and so there are these four risks of should we build it, will people use it, will people buy it, will our customers support it or our business support it? And you're trying to answer those questions with a designer and a product engineer.

Lenny (00:14:52):
Of these four, so value, usability, viability, feasibility, where do you think most new PMs fail most or should spend more time?

Christian Idiodi (00:15:00):
Oh my goodness, value. Value is probably, it is the most important and the most overlooked. And the big driver for that is often because of the operating model of teams. Teams are often given roadmaps of projects and features to go build and deliver. If that's the case, you actually really don't need a product manager because they're going to assume value. If the boss told me to build this, I cannot say, "Should we build this? Is this the right thing to build? Is there a better option? Is this what people will buy?" You just assume it's valuable.

(00:15:38):
And so often, when people ask me why does the product manager seem to play like a core leadership role on a team, almost like the quarterback. And it's not that they're more special in solving the problem that the designer or the engineer, but they're answering a question that determines if we should be working on this in the first place.

(00:15:57):
So value is often the hardest thing to solve and must be overlooked. We often see bad patterns where companies will say, "Yes, we ran a test, with 300 users and they all scored it 84% or 90%. They love it." In that way. I said, "Well, just because somebody can use your product doesn't mean that they will buy it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean they will choose it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean that they will actually use it." And what people say is often different from what they do. And our job is to actually solve the problem, which is what core value is, in a meaningful way. And often overlooked because we check the box on our own item. So the most important, because that's to the point of the certificate of appreciation, what you get in return, that's the ultimate outcome. Really, value.

Lenny (00:16:55):
You once gave a talk along these lines around discovery, and it was this talk of here's all of the things you can do to help understand what to build to make something valuable. There's a billion frameworks for every step of the discovery process, press releases, story mapping, opportunity solution, trees, fake door tests, all these things. And you're like, if we had to pick one thing, if there's one process or approach that you recommend most, your answer was essentially finding some number of reference customers to work with and helping them and working with them to design the product. Do you still see that as the one, if you had to pick one approach to figure out what to build? And if so, you just talk about how you recommend going about that.

Christian Idiodi (00:17:35):
The holy grail of product walk is really a reference customer. This is somebody that has used your solution or your product, loves it enough to tell people about it. I kind of described the work of the product team is to solve problems in a way that customers love and a way that works for our business. The ultimate definition for me today of the love that somebody has for our product is they're willing to put their reputation on the line by telling people about it. And for me, if we think about you do a lot of interviews with founders and entrepreneurs and you're going to have people that they find a market with an idea and they jump in. But if you think at the core of some of these founder-inspired businesses where the founder will say, "Well, I had a problem and it was their problem and they focused on solving the problem and then they got their friends on it."

(00:18:39):
And so it's almost like this idea that if they were their own first reference customer. They were so close to the problem, immersed in the environment of the problem, solved it in a compelling way enough where it was like, there are more people like me. And it is like if I said to you, "Lenny, let's go to a steakhouse. Find me a new steakhouse around you." You might go online and Google and you see a steakhouse with one review. How do you feel about that? I don't know. Maybe other people don't want to try this. You see two reviews, you're like, maybe it's the chef and their spouse or something. The question is how many positive reviews would you have to see to jump and say, "Let's go try this one." There are some things inherent in, if you look at Geoffrey Moore's adoption curve and those kinds of models in here, most people don't want to be the first to try things. But you are likely to try things if other people that look like you have accepted it or defined it as good.

(00:19:39):
And so the whole essence for me of this technique is to create those first people, those reference customers. If you think about how companies make the shift to becoming sales-led or operations-led, almost all companies start product-led. The product is first. You kind of build something and it's like, yeah, it's going, let's hire salespeople and marketing people and operational people to do it. What's really happening is that the product team created the first customers. And now a group of people have to capture the value that was created. So what's happening here is that it is constantly the job of product teams. The reason they lose influence is because salespeople are having to sell a product. You see? So they're like forcing back, "I need this and I need this." But if you came to me and said, "I want to buy steak," and I say, "Let me show you 20 people that look like you that recommend this steakhouse," my job as a salesperson is very easy. I'm just like, "Hey, you should eat here. Everybody that loves steak, they all eat here."

(00:20:44):
So product teams feel, at this contract to an organization when they don't create powerful reference customers. So it's by far my favorite technique. And the way this technique works is you want to discover and deliver and develop who has the problem, the customer. I want to discover who has the problem. At the same time, discover and deliver a solution to this problem. The idea here is that if you really want to solve a problem, you need to get out of your building. Go spend time with someone that has the problem and don't leave until you solve the problem. People talk about why we had such a record time to the Covid vaccine. Sure, technology has improved, our research has improved. But if you think about it, we had the highest number of volunteers for vaccination in the history of any vaccine in the history of time.

(00:21:36):
Why? Did we have to look for someone with Covid? No, they were literally all around us. The research was immersed in the environment of the problem. They could study... and so this is often what I call, it's almost like a pressure-cooked discovery in some ways. If you truly, truly want to solve a problem, get out of your building, get out of the assumptions, get out of your opinions. Immerse yourself, find someone who has the problem, stick with them until you discover a solution for this problem. And you're going to do that. The part of why I love this technique, the two biggest reasons I think, the first is if I cannot find a certain number of people that have this problem, my goodness, it might not be a problem, but solve it. I have never had a product failure using this technique. If I were to credit... goodness, I think last count, I'm up to like 205 products I have worked on or participated in creating in my career. And I tried to build a new product every year from scratch. It's kind of a crazy thing about me. My friends know what I want for my bad day is a problem worth solving. And I like to go from idea to revenue, and the setup, and I test all of these techniques in this way. And everybody knows my favorite technique is if we find a problem worth solving, we need to uncover a solution for B2B, I want six to eight references, for B2C, I want maybe 15 to 25 references as an indication that we've achieved product market fit.

Lenny (00:23:15):
Just to be clear, you said you still work, you build products yourself and you practice this and you've built... okay, what's like every recent product that you've built? I didn't know this.

Christian Idiodi (00:23:25):
So I do a lot of work in Africa now. WorkNigeria is like a job board that helps people. We do kind of a job board HR replacement and advisory too as well. I'm actually working on another app around the NDA and protecting high-asset individuals in some ways. So kind of every year, I find a problem like that worth solving and I practice doing the work of discovery with a team of people.

Lenny (00:23:54):
That's amazing. I see this unraveling of the most interesting man in the world is happening a little, bit by bit. We learn more and more about you. Okay, amazing. So just to kind of summarize some of these-

Lenny (00:24:03):
Okay, amazing. So just to summarize some of these points, which are really great and I've never heard it described this way before. So basically, a really effective way to understand how to build something people actually want and solve real problems is this idea of pick reference customers. And I really like this word reference, which is not just they're going to help you build a thing, but they're also become a reference to future customers because they end up loving it because you built it for them and they love it.

(00:24:27):
Your advice is find six to eight in B2B space, 15 to 25 in B2C. And the reason there's a number here is if you find just one or two, you never know, they might be just the one or two that have this really weird problem that no one else has. And I think that's usually the flaw in this approach is you end up building it for a small number of people and nobody else really wants it. And it sounds like in your experience, this is a good kind of number where probably a lot of more people will have this problem.

Christian Idiodi (00:24:53):
Yeah. There've been studies to validate some of these numbers. I think early, IBM, kind of struggled selling those supercomputers. And if you're buying a million dollar computer, someone says, "Hey, do you want to buy?" And you're like, "I don't know. Is there anybody else that has bought it? Shall I be the first?" And there was this common question of what would it take for you to buy it? And someone says, "Hey, if I see five or six people that look like me already have this, then I feel confident making the argument to my company, we should jump on it." And it's like, so how do I create the first five to six? And you can see a lot of the validation on B2C in some of the things you might see in the App Store on Yelp or those places. My idea here is if you found a steakhouse with 25 5-star reviews, you are likely to adopt this.

(00:25:41):
So in every app I have ever put on the App Store, on the day I launch the app in the app store, they are 25 5-star reviews. I will never launch an app and be like, "Let's hope Lenny loves it. Let's see who the first person." On the very first day of launching the app, there are 25... so I will know I am not ready until I have achieved 25 people that have told me, worked with me and said, "I am now ready to put my reputation the line." Sometimes I might need to work with 30 people or 50 people because the output is 25 reference customers. Because if Lenny is like, "I don't love it enough" or "I don't feel comfortable," I'm not going to customize for Lenny. I'm going to find my single target market, talk to more people. If I get 25, I have achieved product market fit.

Lenny (00:26:29):
So interesting. It basically kicks in this word of mouth flywheel that everyone's always looking for is how do I get people to talk about it. Build it for them, solve their problems, tell them that it exists. You mentioned a bit about how you understand if it's actually, let's call a product market fit, if you have product market fit with these people that you ask them if they're going to leave you a 5-star review for example. I guess what do you consider this is good, I got one more person that's really happy with this? What tells you it's got product market fit with a person?

Christian Idiodi (00:26:55):
If I were thinking about how I will do this, pick a problem to solve, first of all, I have to know who I'm solving the problem for. And in some indication and I want to validate that this is actually a problem you do have. And I'm looking for a certain type of person. These early adopters in our world are broken up to technologists and evangelists. Technologists could be, "I love the new iPhone 16 is coming out and it's going to have five cameras and I write an article in some tech review board. Super fast, super sleek, all good design." You just love new technology. You always jump on new technology. And evangelist could be someone that says, "Oh my, I look great with the iPhone 15, it has three cameras. I will look phenomenal with the iPhone 16, so I'm going to go stand in line at the Apple Store for three hours or overnight because I just can't wait to get my hands on the Apple 16."

(00:27:53):
They may feel a little irrational, but those are the kind of people you're looking for, people that believe they have a problem. So it's like you will try any steakhouse, in my example. You're just like, "I love steak. I don't care if there are reviews or not. I'll try it." And what I'm trying to do here is I'm saying, okay, Lenny loves steak, he wants to try a steakhouse. And I'm good to say, "Lenny, I'm trying to build the best steakhouse here. If I create a menu that you absolutely love, are you willing to tell people about it?" That could be a video testimonial, write a review, stuff like that. And it's okay Lenny, if you don't love the first iteration of it and stuff like that, I want to hear your feedback. I want you to work with me in ensuring that I build the best steakhouse here. And that's kind of the idea.

(00:28:37):
So I'm going to work with 25 people that look like you and I'm going to keep tweaking, in this sense iterating on the product and the menu until Lenny's like, "My goodness, this is the best steakhouse in the world." It is like I'm just going to write about it and when I get 25 people that have all, it's not the steakhouse, they love it enough. Because this is where you really get the shift in value. Because if I say, "Lenny, go write me a review, a five-star review." You're like, "I don't know if I feel comfortable about." You say, "Why not?" You see, I'm really going to get deeper feedback because people will say or do anything just to avoid hurting our feelings or for us to get out of their face. So they'll be like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll give you a five-star review." But when I say do it, you're like, "Well, I have this hesitation." Why? That's really where great discovery comes. But it's hard to in a silo. You have to be immersed with the person that has the problem. So product market fit is when you iterate it in this discovery, you've discovered and delivered something so meaningful that these customers that are your target customers, are willing to put their reputation on the line and be a reference. That's my indication.

Lenny (00:29:49):
I imagine though, Christian, so charismatic, comes to me and says, "Hey Lenny, would you leave me a five star review for this product. I'm working on this, I'm trying to figure out if people want it." I would be like, "Yeah, of course. I'll leave you a five-star review." What do you do to kind of avoid that, just like I just want to be nice, like I don't care, I'll leave a five-star review.

Christian Idiodi (00:30:06):
You. It's part of why I need 25 in B2C. And don't get me wrong, if I can convince 25 people in there, I may have a marketing product and a charismatic marketing products. If that's all I needed to do was a good message and charisma to get people on it. The good benefits of this is that you can tackle risk very early because you can involve many other parts of your organization, marketing, sales, legal, finance. People often ask me how do I come up with the marketing spiel or the description? I'm like, "I don't make that up." If I ask Lenny, "What do you feel about this product?" And he says, "Well, it's cool and it's very sleek and very nice." The marketing department will say, "We don't like those terms. We want to call it comprehensive." And when you go out to sell your product, people are going to be disappointed because the expectations are created by what's on the box.

(00:31:04):
I only market exactly what customers tell me. I have never been surprised about what customers will say when I release a product because in this technique I already get their feedback. And so I'm going to put exactly what Lenny said on the box. "Hey, this product's cool and sleek and easy to use." I've only launched a product that says super fast but difficult to read because the technology team said there was no way to change the font on something and it was just going to be difficult to read. And you know what everybody did when they got the product? "Oh my goodness, it is super [inaudible 00:31:39]. All right, it is also difficult to read." It matched their expectations in some ways. So what I do here is I learn how to sell the product with this technique, I learn how to market the product because I have real people, that we're not making assumptions.

(00:31:54):
What's the best way to market this? How much Lenny? How would you find this? Does this language resonate with you? Does this properly describe the menu? See? So that's kind of what you're doing when you use a technique like this. It feels heavy to people, but that's kind of part of the practice of it. If you do this a whole lot, you get really comfortable at involving, you're working with your customers to solve it. But for me, the fact that you will not have a product failure because you have a natural pivot out, meaning if I can't find 25 people that love steak, why in the world am I building a steakhouse? So if you don't find enough people that love this problem and are willing to help you, just be like, this is not a problem worth solving. But more importantly, you really start to get... is the fastest part to product market fit, the clearest definition for me because I know when my product is ready, when I've dotted those I's and crossed those T's, in that way.

Lenny (00:32:49):
I think your point there, recruiting is itself a huge signal, is really important. Can you find people that have this problem and care enough about this problem that they're going to talk to you and spend time exploring this thing that doesn't exist yet. I think that's super interesting. And then I think another key part of this is it's one solution that solves many people's problems. And it can't be a bunch of different things for a bunch of different people.

Christian Idiodi (00:33:10):
That's right, that's right. If one person says, "I don't want this," wants this, another person wants this, you don't do it. That's how you know you do the minimum. All 25 have to want the same thing. If one person's out, you just don't do it at all. And the reason that's powerful is because if I come to you and I say, "Hey, it's missing this feature." I say, "Well yeah, 25 people that look like you that are very happy without it." You see? That's how if you think about what you do in a review, you see the five stars and you instantly like, "Oh, that's good enough." But if you have a question, what do you do, you cannot double click on the review to read. And that's how people get convinced. There's this social influence of like, "Well, Lenny's cool, he likes the steakhouse. I should like it. He's fine with this not being there so I should be fine with it." So your references are super powerful in more than any company, in influencing consumers on what they should choose or not choose.

Lenny (00:34:06):
Basically, Strive builds new products exactly this way. They find new customers that have a problem and they work with very small number of customers to build a product for them, and that's how a lot of their new product... I think Rippling works like this too. So I think this is a really good lesson for everyone listening, if they're trying to build something new. Is there an example that comes to mind that would be, I don't know, interesting to talk through, of something you built that you worked through this process?

Christian Idiodi (00:34:30):
Oh, boy. I tell the example of solving a problem when I was at a staffing company, a snag job. They do hourly jobs and help people find their best job or an hourly job and I actually get a call here from the head of Global staffing at Starbucks. Now, he called me, you can see the benefit of this technique, because I'm the person he calls when he has problems. I've used this technique with him at a previous company. He didn't even know I was at a new company. And he calls me up and he says, "Christian, I have a problem." I said, "Well, don't we all have problems?" He said, well, "We just bought a bakery in the San Francisco Bay Area. And as we're doing the paperwork to kind of take over this company or this acquisition, we realized that close to 800 of the employees may be undocumented workers."

(00:35:22):
And I said, "Wow, that does sound like a problem." He's like, "Yeah, imagine if this breaks out in the news and all of that. But more importantly, we still need to get all their paperwork. So all these people are going to quit and we'll have a new bakery without employees." And my first question to him as a product guy is like, "Wow, would you give me a million dollars to solve this problem?" And it's like, "No, seriously?" I was like, "300,000." I'm throwing out numbers. He's like, "Maybe." I said, "Wow, you have my attention." I go to my CEO, I tell him to call. I grab a designer and an engineer. I just say, "Hey look, I would love to work on a little project with you all if you have some time." I kind of debrief them on the call. Now the first thing I have to do is to try to define the problem, identify problems. What really is the problem going on?

(00:36:08):
Yeah, we're breaking it down, we're talking through this. We say, well, at the end of the day, Starbucks needs to hire like 800 people quickly because we can't fix getting everybody's paperwork. But they're going to lose these people and they need to hire those quickly. And I say, well, who else has this problem? We're trying to throw out guesses. I'm like, "What are we talking about? Let's go out." Everybody jumps in my car and we start driving around and this is where we're doing our product work from. We're talking in the car, just out of the building. We see a new construction site for a new McDonald's coming soon and we're curious. We're like, well, "Let's go find out." We start talking to people on sites. Fortunately, the operations director is on site and we ask him, we say, tell us about opening up a new McDonald's.

(00:36:54):
He says, "Well, do you know we need like 120 people on opening day?" We're like, "Whoa, for McDonald's? Really, 120 people?" He's like, "Yeah, do you know that most of the people in this industry don't show up to work on the very first day, and every day we're in construction, we're losing money. So the second the bathrooms, the restrooms, are done, we want to open up." We're like, "Wow, we didn't think about this, new construction, a new store opening." They need to hire lots of people quickly. So I said, "Thank you very much." I gave him my business card, he gave me his. We jumped back in the car. We just kept driving. We went to the mall. We started talking to people there. We talked to a manager at Macy's and she said, "Oh look, we hire 20,000 people in the holiday season."

(00:37:36):
We're like, "Macy's." Yeah, it's like nights, weekend, shipping, stuff like this. We started hiring in the summer because of how painful it is. Now, all we're doing here is just validating that this is a real problem, like other people will have the problem. So we go back to the office, we're brainstorming, like, "How will someone even go about solving this problem?" We're thinking this was like, we're not really sure, but McDonald's guy was very desperate. I said, " I have his business card." We start throwing some ideas. So I called the McDonald's person and I said, "Look, you just met with us." He's like, "Yeah. We would love to help you solve the problem." He said, "Well, what do you have in mind?" I said, "We've been talking. What if we just sent you some people to interview. And if you like them, you'll hire them."

(00:38:18):
He said, "That seems fairly easy." He's like, "How do I pay for this?" And we took a swag like, "Maybe you pay us for everybody that you hire." He was like, "Oh, I don't see much risk to that. This is great." I'm like, "Oh, okay." We have no sense of what to do. We are literally Googling, how do people find a job at McDonald's? We go to colleges, we are sticking up flyers. We are putting ads in the newspaper back then, we are looking at different techniques to try to get people into a funnel and interest by posting on Craigslist or things like that. At the end of the week, we get about 40 people that are interested to come to the interview. We're like, that feels good for our first try. We call the manager up and we say, "Look, on Monday we will send you 40 people to interview. This is great."

(00:39:05):
Monday I take my designer, my engineer, we are on site with the manager. At nine o'clock, we expect three people to show up for interviews. Nobody shows up. 10 o'clock, another three, one person shows up. We got to the end of the day, less than 20 people show up. This man only has four or five people. We are like, "We suck this. This is terrible." We go to the manager, " Let's go and apologize for wasting your day and stuff." He starts to laugh. We're like, "What's going on?" He said, "Look, I forgot to tell you. Folks in this industry don't even show up to interviews. We are McDonald's, we pay minimum wage. People will leave us for 25 more cents an hour. They will leave us for a job that is one block closer to their house or less than a mile closer to their home."

(00:39:54):
Now, the engineer is with us and he's thinking about it. It's like, this is really interesting. About half of the people showed up. He hired one in five. If you really want to solve this problem, playing the laws of averages, we probably need to send this man close to 200 people. We need to go bigger. So we are storming the office, we called the McDonald's guy again. I was like, "Can we try again next Monday?" And he's like, "Do I only pay for the people I hire?" We're like, "Sure." It's like, "Oh, go ahead and kill yourself on this." It's a pain. We've been trying all kinds of things for years.

(00:40:26):
Now, we start doubling down our efforts. We start calling back all the people that didn't show up for interviews like, "What's going on? Did you get lost? Don't you want a job? What's wrong with you?" We start figuring out what portals worked well for us the last time, what wasted our money, what was the cost to acquire a person. And we spend a week doubling our efforts on those channels. We probably have about 120, 130 people on the list. The Sunday beforehand, we start calling them up like, "Please show up. Don't embarrass us. Don't you want the job? Do you need that address? Should I call you a reminder, set your alarm." We're trying all the techniques to try to get more people. There we go the next day and at the end of the day he has about forty-five to 50 people. He comes to us, he shakes our hand. He's like, "Whoa, the quality was excellent. All my recruiters were engaged. The day was smooth," [inaudible 00:41:17] how successful we are.

(00:41:18):
He's like, "I want to use you for every new McDonald's I open in the area." Now, I don't know I have a product. I just know I was able to help one person at McDonald's. But I feel like I have enough learning. So I called up my friend at Starbucks and I said, "Hey, man, remember the problem we talked the about?" He's like, "Yeah. I would love to help you solve it." He said, "Oh, okay. What do you have in mind?" I said, "Well, I think we need to send you about 3000 people to interview." He said, "3000 people? I told you I only need 800." I said, in this industry, most people don't show up for interviews, right? He said, "Oh my goodness. You know our industry well. I like this. I'm going to take this up, I think we'll give you this contract." I take my designer, my engineer, we go to San Francisco. We're out there recruiting because this is where it was based. We have to get a whole hotel, hire people. We are working all the channels we knew, working in the area. Remember, we don't have any software, no technology. The designer, we're doing this manually, Excel spreadsheets, phones, emails, in that way. In one week, Starbucks hired 784 people. I get an email the next Monday morning from the contact at Starbucks. He copied Howard Schultz, then CEO of Starbucks. The email read, "These guys just saved our butts." I sent it to my CEO, but then I said, "You know what?" I only know now I can help on McDonald's and a Starbucks, but that doesn't mean I have a product. But I now have enough of problem definition. I reached out to the head of marketing, the head of sales. I said, "Tell us who has this problem you've come across," because we need to work with more people to try to uncover a solution that is scalable, maintainable, reliable, and works for our business. Weirdly enough, the next opportunity we had was the Los Angeles International Airport. They were opening up a new terminal and they said, "We need 200 people to manage all the stores in the new terminal." And we were like, "200 people? We just hired close to 800. We got this." We go to LA for the briefing with the staffing group and they tell us the people that work at an international airport have to match the demographics of the travelers. We say, "Say what? Yeah, we have 13% Chinese-speaking travelers, we need 13% Chinese-speaking employees." We say, "Sorry? We've got 5% Korean speaking." I mean my team is in LA, we're in Chinatown. We are speaking, trying to recruit people to come and work in an airport. If we expect 10 people to show up, only one person shows up.

(00:43:49):
We start calling job seekers up like, "What's going on?" They say, "Do you know what it means to work at an airport?" First, I wake up at five o'clock, I drive to the employee parking lot. I get into a bus. Then I go through security. There was not like TSA pre-check back then. Then if I want to break, I go to security again and then you pay me minimum wage. It took us close to three months to staff this. We had to negotiate with the union to raise the price to like $15 an hour to attract people. When we come back from that, you know what we're saying, that is not our customer. Never again. We are never doing airports. That's a pain.

(00:44:24):
Around this time, it was the holiday season, so we reached out to the person at Macy's. We told them about our work with McDonald's. They say, "Oh, we'll try this." We started working with them. You can imagine through this, the engineer is thinking, how can I use technology to improve this? I always tell this to people, I never wrote a requirements document, I never wrote a story. So the designer is thinking, how can we improve the end-to-end experience? Okay, we need a recruiter experience, a job seeker experience. We had a funnel. We need to build a scheduling tool so that they can scale the interview. Oh, what about notification? Maybe text message. We can send them a map so that they can know how to get to the... I mean, all of these things, because they were involved from the very beginning in defining the problem, they were immersed in the solution to the problem. It takes us about eight and a half, almost nine months to build this. When we launched this product in its first 90 days, it booked $32 million in sales.

(00:45:22):
Why? Because you got McDonald's probably until today using this product to open up every new store. Well, Starbucks went to the global contract. We say, " Well, we've only done discovery in the US so I only know where it works in this market." And we started finding, if you look at NASCAR, some of these big sporting events, they have to bring a lot of people together very quickly for a short amount of time. And this is the same kind of product they use to do that high volume hiring in a short amount of time. If you think about it, I was discovering who had the problem and developing the customers that have the problem. At the same time, I was discovering and delivering a solution to that problem.

Lenny (00:46:01):
That's insane. You said you made thirty-something million dollars the first year of launching this thing.

Christian Idiodi (00:46:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:46:06):
That's unreal. I love how this is the epitome of doing things that don't scale. You going hiring McDonald's employees and then Starbucks employees.

Christian Idiodi (00:46:15):
That's right.

Lenny (00:46:16):
Then airport employees. Wow.

Christian Idiodi (00:46:18):
You do things that don't scale and then you do things that do scale. And it's so powerful when you discover how to do things that don't scale, when you actually know. Because it's the power of technology is just the beauty of what it can do at scale.

Lenny (00:46:34):
And to that point, it's easier said... a lot of people talk about doing things that don't scale. Many people don't actually do anything like that. They're like, "Nah, let someone else figure that out, or let's just actually think about the future of this versus just doing it and solving and finding problems." I love that also, you didn't do any of these other, the things we talked about. There's no fake door test, there's no opportunity solution trees. There's no user interview. You're talking to people. It wasn't like a user research interview, come sit down, ask questions.

Christian Idiodi (00:47:00):
I said, there's nothing better in learning how to solve a problem than trying to solve the problem. You will get all the answers, the research, the failure, the mistakes, all the evidence. You know the difference between what people say, this is what they do. You'll validate and test. Because at the end of the day, what is statistically relevant? Solving the problem is the clearest indication that we've solved the problem and that we know how to solve the problem then. And so yeah, very powerful technique.

Lenny (00:47:30):
And I love that you didn't really know exactly where this was going to lead. It was just kind of this exploratory, let's see if there's something here. And you just kept following this like, huh, there's a problem. It looks like we found a way to solve it. Let's just see where else this can take us. Amazing.

(00:48:34):
I want to shift to a different topic. You spend a lot of time helping product leaders get better at coaching, get better at building relationships, get better at building trust with their teammates. Marty Cagan actually shared this quote with me when he joined, he said that you can build trust with executives and product leaders faster than anyone else he knows, and the people you coach adore him like some kind of rock star.

(00:48:57):
He's literally on speed dial for several of the CEOs of the largest companies in the world. Okay, so let me just ask you, what's your secret to being a great coach, and how can people listening become better coaches to their reports, maybe colleagues?

Christian Idiodi (00:49:12):
This topic is probably near and dear to my heart because, I mean, there are many ways that I think our corporate structures have failed in creating high performance and stability in people, and I think one of them is actually encro of leadership. And by leadership, the key component I often point to is coaching. This idea of what truly is the job of a leader. And I tell people, yeah, it's context and culture at the highest level like, why are we here? Where are we going? How do we organize ourselves to get there? What's important?

(00:49:51):
Just kinds of things and the environment in which we do it, but there's a people element because you recognize that you want an outcome and you need people working together to that outcome. So I now have to staff those people and I have to hire and train them and equip them and then appoint them to what those things are. But many of those things are one-off, meaning I create a vision, I create a strategy. I hire a person. There's something that is every day and that's coaching, that's like the day job of managers. And if I think about high performing teams in the world, and you can pick sports is one of those, artists, they have coaches and managers like it's an everyday thing. And the idea is that when I explain this to people, I say doing product management is a product manager's job, but getting better at product management is the manager's job, is the coach's job. And people tend to misunderstand how that dynamic works.

(00:50:57):
You see, if you are playing a game, you're in the game. The coaches are on the sideline watching you play the game and getting you better at playing the game. Your job may be to kick or pass the ball and you need a competence level, but somebody's job is every day looking for ways for you to be better at your job.

(00:51:16):
The number one reason most people don't give good coaching is because they've never experienced good coaching themselves. And most people can only give to other people what has been given to them, what experiences they've seen. I was in an executive meeting with a CEO and he gets up in a meeting and he just starts screaming and cursing at everybody, just throwing up And I said, "Whoa, whoa." I said, "Can we talk outside?" They pick him outside. I was like, "First of all, I don't even think I can work with you anymore given this environment you're creating, but I need to understand why you are talking to your team like that." And he says to me, he says, "Christian, well my boss used to scream at me like this. And look at me, I'm now a CEO, I got it, I understand it. They are grownups, they can understand it too."

(00:52:05):
And I said, "Well, tell me what you're trying to communicate." And he explains it to me and stuff and I said, "Is it okay if I show you an alternative way of communicating that?" He says, "What do you mean?" I said, "Well is it first of all safe for me to do this with the team?" So I go back to the team and I say, "Look, I'm going to try to say what the CEO was trying to say again. He's giving me permission for you to speak freely and candidly, I want your honest opinion as to what was more effective and why." And I took a stab at kind of representing what he was trying to say and I asked the team and it's like, yeah, it's the same thing kind of message, but when he tells us this stuff we just go do it. We get it, we go do it. But the way you described it right now to us, I can think of four other things I need to do. I even understand some other things that may be missing that we need to now go tackle.

(00:52:57):
And the CEO is kind of really taken aback and it's kind of in some ways he has never seen an alternative. And he's never seen if an alternative be effective. Most people need to see something then they need to do it before they can even teach it, in some ways. Now I'm saying this all because I need to make a very strong argument for people understanding coaching. And in some ways I probably did not know that I was probably good at coaching. I coached my kids in soccer for eight years and we always won the championship, my boys team and I had long waiting list of people and I thought I had a fundamental flaw in understanding it because when my kids were all four years old, when you have the kids run around the soccer field just kicking the ball any way, my team always had plays, they all have strategy.

(00:53:49):
So winning games like 10 to zero, other kids, I thought I'm like, maybe I was born in another country. I didn't know you were just meant to let them play. And I was really coaching kids and I was treating four-year-olds like adults. We're watching video, watching tape, having real... [inaudible 00:54:05] But it was so funny when you see them execute on the field. But I've kind of always had this mentality about the truest forms like companies cannot care for people, people care for people. And the representation of what is acceptable in an environment or what we do is by the leaders. Now there's some different dynamic to why that's not happening with how we promote people and the whole poor structure around that. But fundamentally, trust is a key part of doing this. And I think when I tell these people, I say, "Look, most people don't know that you know something until they test you."

(00:54:50):
We do it a whole lot in our environment. I ask you a question, I see how you answer and it's like I might ask you what's one plus one? It's two and now I know that one plus one is two. I don't care when you learned it. I need you to know that it's two to do my work. So it happens in everyday environment and what people fail to do is to do the learning so they get the question wrong and they lose trust. And trust is based on competence and character, there are other values like communication and concern and care, but most corporate environments, it's a competency thing. That's why you see so many companies accept people with bad communication, bad care, because they're very good at their job. So if you can demonstrate competence, you will earn some trust, at least the trust of competence from people.

(00:55:44):
So I kind of explained to people a whole lot that the real core of their job at first is to learn, to seek to understand before they are understood, to know what you don't know. That humility and ego only last a small minute. The most powerful way I have found to get trust with many people is to have them accountable for an outcome of mine, which is to know. So if I wanted to accelerate trust with Lenny, I will ask Lenny to teach me. And I see this like an emotional intelligence, black belt technique here, but many environments, if you get into environment, it's very quickly for you to identify the power in that environment. Who is influential? Who has loudest voice and all? And there's something behind why they're powerful. Yes it is title, but if you think about why someone is called a CEO, it's because there's some competence that made someone give them the title, they are great at growing businesses, they have a good stride, whatever it is.

(00:56:51):
So what you do to build trust is you want that person to trust you. Okay. But the only way that person will know that they trust you is if they test you. And unfortunately many environments they do that publicly. I'm in a meeting, I ask Lenny a question. He bumps a presentation like, oh, product managers are useless. That person doesn't know anything. So here's what I do when I want to build trust, if Lenny's a new hire in my company, I take Lenny to the loudest, most influential person in the company. And I say, "Look, I just hired Lenny. Super rockstar, did all of this. But he knows nothing about that business, nothing about how we work and stuff. I will love for you to teach him some things." Now he may be like, "I'm super busy, I'm involved."

(00:57:36):
I say, "Look, Lenny should just hang with you. I've played his calendar for the whole week. He's just got to sit in meetings you are, quiet, observe, just by observing you, he will be a rockstar. No stress, nothing to give." Now it's impossible for this leader to sit with you for a whole week without saying things like, "So Lenny, where are you from? What do you do? Tell me about yourself." What have I now done? I forced a relationship between a very powerful, trustworthy, influential person and somebody else that doesn't have it. If you are walking around the company with this person, what is everybody going to say? Oh my goodness, you're friends with that person. I want to know Lenny because we can never get him to agree on it. So if I know Lenny, I'll be close with it. Lenny is more accessible, he's new, but how did Lenny break in? I'm extending somebody else's trust to you. Now by also making that person share in the accountability of training you or teaching you, in some ways, I am now making them accountable for your growth. It's impossible two months from now for that person to say, "Oh, Lenny doesn't do anything." Why? Because it makes them a bad teacher. So they're always going to be friendly, be like, "Oh yeah, Lenny, let's have a conversation. Don't do it like this in this way." They will prep you because it makes them look bad if you're not competent. Now, this technique accelerates relationships and trust. It's the help me teach me type of technique. It also allows them to observe the dynamics within the company, but it accelerates relationships because it's impossible for you to be in a meeting with a leader all the time without the person saying something like, "Oh yeah, hey folks, let me introduce you to Lenny."

(00:59:20):
Now that person is now the one introducing you to more connections within the company. Fastest way to build is, now feels like it's a expense but this is the job of a coach. You are designing a very specific playbook to help people achieve the outcomes reward and that's by getting them competent at their job and then their potential where they need to go next.

Lenny (00:59:45):
That are some Jedi ninja tricks right there. I love that. I've never heard this advice before. Makes so much sense and it's so easy to implement.

Christian Idiodi (00:59:54):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:59:54):
Amazing. For someone that maybe doesn't have a Christian around as a coach or a manager that isn't at this level, what advice do you give people that are looking for a coach or someone that could help them along these lines to learn to build trust and learn to just generally improve?

Christian Idiodi (01:00:09):
Boy, like I say with everything, you don't get mastery by avoidance. And one of the things that good coaches do that when I say corporations fail companies is they don't create space for practice. I see people complain to me about people all the time, oh this person is not good. They presented this, it was terrible. And I ask them, "What did they do at practice?" They say, "What do you mean?" I say, "When they were practicing this, what did they do?" Say, "Well, they didn't practice. I told them to prepare this." I say, "Think about what happens at practice. Any practice of any sport, any game. You can stop. You can make corrections, you can give feedback. What you do at practice, you do in the game. Product management is a one time, game time kind of role. So when do people practice?"

(01:00:57):
And so what I tell people in the absence of getting good coaching, you need to find practice arenas. It's kind of like if you are learning a new sport or basketball, you kind go to the gym. It's a practice arena. You can play and shoot around and let maybe some people have pickup games that you join and stuff like this in some ways. And so I always advise product managers like, you need to join a lot of pickup games, which they are low barriers to entry, low evaluation reward, loan risk type of thing. Go volunteer at a non-profit working with the team, go volunteer in your community event or church or whatever you go to, go party. But now what am I trying to do with these things? Find places where people do collaborative problem solving. That is what you're doing as a product team.

(01:01:50):
It's more likely in a high performance environment you'll find a good coach. You'll find somebody out there but what you're also doing is you're observing other people play. Most people learn a lot of skills by, you watch TV like, oh I like that move. And then you go to the gym and you practice that move, you see what you do? So it's like you're seeing then you're doing it in some ways. So you need to see good product work so that you can do good product work so that you can teach good product work. So if you don't have the benefit of having a good coach directly, you've got to find environments where you see good coaching happening and a good indication of good coaching is actually good outcomes over and over again. Winning teams, winning performances, great products, great products come from great product teams. They probably have good leaders or a good leader within a bad culture.

Lenny (01:02:45):
So essentially it's get a bunch of reps in is a big part of this advice. Just get reps in and I think what you just said is such an important part of it is collaborative problem solving is the key thing to look for. I was going to ask you how you recommend people get into product management. I imagine this is a very similar answer, it's just find opportunities to collaboratively problem solve.

Christian Idiodi (01:03:04):
That's right. And I differentiate that because there are all those guys that are the, I know I like to change a light bulb or they can walk individually or thinker and stuff and I kind of differentiate that problem solving from the people that are very good at working with other people to solve a problem. And there are so many of those pockets, you're getting reps. You've heard those who that just tell you stories of them working problem and I can see how they will help me. They know how to use data, they know how to use insights. They're not afraid of talking to people. How are you going to get those reps? Because you come into my company I ask you a question like, oh, I really don't know where do I find? But if you've done the problem solve with a team, sometimes you may not even know how to get the answer, but you know who to go to get the answer. That's a gift too.

Lenny (01:03:52):
I love that so much of your advice comes back to being the person that knows the most or has learned the most or even looking like they're spending the time to learn the most, which makes so much sense. The people you want to entrust are the people that happen to have the answers.

Christian Idiodi (01:04:05):
I try.

Lenny (01:04:06):
And each person will know. Yeah, it just makes sense. Something else you talk about is people getting promoted too early. Leaders getting promoted too early, not doing well, they end up blaming others when really they were not actually ready for this new position. Can you talk about why you think that happens and then just how maybe as that person that might be in that position right now feeling like, oh, shit, maybe it's not my fault.

Christian Idiodi (01:04:31):
I don't know how to make an appeal to corporations on this one. It's a similar appeal in the light of coaching too as well. Most people are promoted to a point of incompetency or so, but I kind describe the dynamic this way. It's kind of like Lenny is a fantastic engineer. If you think about it, he wins engineer of the year awards. If you go to the office, his picture is on the wall, everybody knows him. He's feeling good. But it's like one year, two years, maybe eight years in Lenny's feeling like, am I really growing in my career? Am I really challenged in my career? He looks at the engineering career ladder. The next role from his senior engineer role is engineering manager. The leadership team, HR, they look at the same thing. That's true. We love Lenny. We don't want to lose Lenny, we need to promote him.

(01:05:20):
And the next step is engineering manager or product manager, manager, however, I want to use the rule here. And so, we do what? We promote Lenny. It feels good at the moment. Yeah! Congratulations on your promotion. He posts a nice post. We are like, "Yeah, we're going to keep Lenny there for long time now because he's promoted." Now, Lenny has never been a manager in his whole life. He's never interviewed people, fired people, didn't even coach people or had done any of those things directly. After a couple of months, Lenny starts to recognize an interesting pattern. Nobody's clapping for him at company meetings anymore. And sure they've taken down his picture from the world because he's no longer an engineer, he's a manager. So somebody else is now the engineer of the year, they are clapping for him in meetings. He's like, he doesn't feel recognized or seen anymore. He's just a guy now behind the scenes and that kind of thing.

(01:06:10):
Then in a couple of weeks go by, then they have a big engineering problem. And you know what Lenny does? He jumps in and he solves the problem. Lenny did not recognize that his job has changed. His job is no longer to solve the problem directly, but to get a team of other people good at solving problems. This is because you're a great engineer but not a good manager. This story or this dynamic I've told is probably the most common origin story of what people see or deem as micromanagement. In many cases here, this individual knows how to do engineering. They don't know how to do engineering management. They don't see the shift in their dynamic being changed. We see back patterns where it's like the second you become a manager or a leader, you cannot say things like, I don't know. I'm not sure, I need help. Who told us those things? But it's like such an expectation that our leaders must have the answers, must know the right things, must do the right things.

(01:07:17):
And so what do we see people do? Rather than Lenny asks for help, he goes to Google and searches how to do an interview, how to write a review. Are you seeing? He reads different articles like this one looks cool and then he does it and nobody dies. Nothing breaks so he thinks there's a good framework and a good pattern. And we have this dysfunctional culture of everybody doing different things, whatever works for anybody and that is the cycle that repeats itself. Now, a person that works for Lenny sees that he used this framework and thinks it must be a good framework, my boss did it, and you see how that cycle repeats itself? Because Lenny didn't actually get coached to be a manager. If you ask anybody that works with me, if come to me and say, "Oh, I need to get promoted to be a director." You know what I say? I say, "Go be a director. You don't need a title. Let me tell you what a director does. And you're going to work with me over the next couple of months to do those things because I am promoting you to do the job, not to learn the job." You see where it falls apart in promotions? We promote people and it's like you're now a VP, do VP things. And you're like, I have never done VP things before, but I cannot tell people I've never done VP things because it makes me look incompetent, but I see the job description. I should do some VP things. What did my last VP do? Those things and those. How you say? But the best place to learn how to be a VP is when you're not a VP because that's where you practice being a VP.

(01:08:52):
That's where you get feedback on because then when you become a VP, you have done those things before. It's like why is the first time you've done an interview when you're now a VP? Come in and do an interview with me, observe me do an interview, ask questions, see what works, get feedback. That's why I love those group product manager roles because those are actually meant to be designed as ways for people to make a decision if they want to be a manager or they want to just stay in the discipline, but people use them as why would you give somebody four direct reports if no evidence, they can manage one? So what I do is I give you one, you might tell me, I hate people. That's okay, we can talk about that. But it's like, let me give you four and you're just going to practice the bad behavior on four.

(01:09:37):
So this is what often happens in company. We promote them into incompetence. It's not their fault because we are not coaching them. What we need to do is create a safe environment for people to practice leadership before they become leaders, before we promote them. We have to have good coaching programs for leaders to say, if there's a succession plan, I want Lenny to be a new manager. I don't wait till it's time to promote him then I teach him management because then apparently he cannot say things like, I don't know. I have to teach him leadership and management before he becomes a leader or a manager.

Lenny (01:10:10):
I love this idea of just doing VP things. I just picture someone walking around and, I'm doing VP things.

Christian Idiodi (01:10:14):
I'm doing VP things. All the time, I see them live, but what's a VP thing?

Lenny (01:10:19):
I'm doing VP things. I think another added benefit of doing these things before you say you're VP is that is the best way to get promoted to a VP is you are already doing the job.

Christian Idiodi (01:10:28):
That's right. And nobody bites you on it. You see that? And you're not even surprised by it and it's very safe because when you're not in the job, you can make mistakes and nobody blames you. He's not a VP, look at him trying to do VP things. You see? But the second you're a VP, there's so much leverage in the role that your mistake is serious because it impacts everybody. But when you're not, it's like you get coverage, you get protection, nobody's as mad at you. It's like, yeah, he was just trying to take a stab at it. Let's coach him on that. But what is the best time to know those things? It's before you're in it. Before you're in it

Lenny (01:11:06):
To give companies and leaders something to do with this advice, you talk about helping them train and practice before they do this. How did you do that? I don't know, is it work with Silicon Valley Product Group to help train and coach?

Christian Idiodi (01:11:18):
There are many great product coaches out there. There are many leadership coaches out there. I think there's some recognition. People have to have the humility and the self-awareness to recognize that there are opportunities for them to get better as a leader and product management, you need to see or experience, good leadership, you need the reps of good leadership and we do it in everyway. You probably talk to people about strategy and what did they do? They outsource it all the time. Tell somebody else to do it, and that cycle feeds itself because you never do it. You only know how to outsource it. You never learn how to do it. You see? And so many people outsource, oh, go get a mentor, go take a training class, and they'll think that they're outsourcing coaching in that way. It's like go take a communication.

Christian Idiodi (01:12:02):
Sourcing coaching in that way. It's like, " [inaudible 01:12:03]. Go take a communication class." I'm like, "Okay." They come back from the class, and they punch you in the face. I'm like, "Why did you punch me?" "The class taught me to punch you in the face. You paid money for me to learn how to punch you in the face." I say, go to the communication class with the employee because they're going to need to practice the communication.

(01:12:20):
You learn what they're learning. Both of you now will practice it together, so that they can get better at communication. A communication class doesn't get you better at communication. Communicating better is an indication that you're better at communication. You need to practice it. And I need to create a safe place for you to practice, I need to give you feedback that you're communicating better. These are all patterns in coaching that many leaders just don't have these tools and techniques to do it.

(01:12:48):
I do teach a lot of leaders how to coach. I do a lot of people work with leaders. There's not a singular product problem. People here me say, "All problems are people problems." There's not a singular problem that I have not seen coaching address.

Lenny (01:13:04):
What I hear is essentially the biggest burden is on the manager to be a great coach to their reports, and for a manager to get good at this, essentially a coach is a really good method. Bring someone in that could work with you one-on-one on a lot of these things. Awesome. That's very actionable, very solvable.

(01:13:21):
Everyone's always going to ask, "How do I find an awesome coach?" Difficult, I guess. I don't know. What do you tell people to go find a coach? Is there anything you could recommend, just how to go find a coach?

Christian Idiodi (01:13:30):
You've got to find people that have generated good outcomes. People are always like, "How do you find a good consultant?" I get people teaching people a lot that haven't done the job. Don't get me wrong. If you look at American football teams, there are some coaches that have played the game before, and you feel good that they can coach you. And there are also some coaches that have not played the game, but if you look at the pedigree, they've learned from good coaches, they've worked under good coaches.

(01:13:57):
Same thing with product. I say there are only two parts. A good coach is someone that has played the game before and has generated good outcomes, and the second is that they've learned from good product coaches. You want to find people with a strong pedigree. You see [inaudible 01:14:12], and you, "Oh, you worked at Amazon this year," or "You worked at this company," or "You worked at Stripe. [inaudible 01:14:18] good results. How did you do that?"

(01:14:19):
"Oh, my environment was great. The culture was great." "Who taught you? Who coached you?" Do pick-up games with the people that they coached. They will tell you what patterns their coach told them. How do you do that? My coach told me to do this, and you're going to learn from them. I say, "Oh." Important things.

Lenny (01:14:37):
Amazing. Okay. Final area I want to spend a little time on is the work you do in Africa. Marty said that you're the foremost expert in introducing product and technology into world's developing countries. I know you spend a lot of time in Africa specifically. Can you just talk about the work you do there and also just maybe the opportunities and challenges you run into when you're working with folks there?

Christian Idiodi (01:14:56):
Yeah. I have an African background, and my family is there, and I used to have this false notion that the things we've done in North America or Europe or Asia, the problems we've solved, have been solved in these markets. I remember talking to someone in Africa years ago, and he said to me, "Oh." I said, "You just got a new job. Where did you find a job?" He's like, "Oh, I found it in a newspaper." I said, "A newspaper? What do you mean found a job?" I remember participating in solving that exact problem in 1998. I was working with the team to solve that, and I had this false assumption that because I solved it here, of course it's solved everywhere.

(01:15:40):
I started to see patterns like this in Africa where just two things were trending. One, so many, the poor use of technology and enabling technologies to solve problems. And two, the difficulty in actually solving problems in these markets, in these emerging markets. And one of the things we take for granted, I always tell people the government is probably the biggest public private product platform in the world. In all countries, they all have this public... Because they provide the infrastructure and the architecture that is enabling for people.

(01:16:18):
Imagine if you were trying to code and you didn't have power. Now you're thinking there are markets where you have to solve the problem of getting power before you then getting access to a computer and then getting access to the right type of software to be able to code something. Look at all the different things. You have to solve many problems just before you can start to solve the problem in a meaningful way. This is a very big reflection of the dynamic in Africa.

(01:16:44):
The second pattern of what we see is because of this challenge, I see two things. One, people make a lot of money on a problem than from solving the problem. There's this whole society that people are very good at walking around problems. "We've got an electricity problem, we'll just buy generators." "We've got a road problem, we're going to buy bigger cars." I was talk at a conference, and I was driving up to it, and I saw a Tesla with a portable generator at the back of it. They'll stop and charge the Tesla, and they keep going on the road. In some ways, that's a whole society, but it's never been a society that didn't have creative people.

(01:17:26):
Just an amazing, tremendous amount of talent. It's a very young population. I talk to people all the time. I say, "Look." Someone told me, "Well, Africa, seven of the eight most underdeveloped places in the world are in Africa."

(01:17:41):
And I said, "Well." They were talking about the discovery of the internet. Less than 30% of Africa has discovered the internet. And I tell them, "Wow. And we created seven Unicoms from that. Imagine if 50%, 75% discovered the internet. We need to understand the opportunities, the youngest population, the fastest growing, some of the fastest growing economies in these markets. Some of the problems are so basic, and the opportunities are so huge. So I had to kill all these assumptions. One, that I needed permission to come to solve problems there, and two, that we didn't have the means to equip and educate people.

(01:18:24):
We don't have a talent problem or a resource problem. The biggest opportunity I've found is to really empower a continent with enabling technology and the mindset and the skills to be able to leverage technology in solving problems.

(01:18:40):
This led to me starting a nonprofit in Africa, the Innovate Africa Foundation, and we are committed to this education of people on the continent, this enablement with technology. We did our first conference last year, the Inspire Africa Conference. It just blew my mind. I'm so humbled when I could see a thousand people from 31 different countries in Africa come with a hunger and an eagerness to learn how to do product work. And it's not cheap by any means for them to do that.

(01:19:14):
What moved me the most is looking at the future generation. We had a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old in the workshop. The 11-year-old was a robotics engineer. The 13-year-old was a CEO of a small startup that keeps healthcare records, a leader. And I'm like, "If I can help these people learn how to do product well, this is the whole generation for Africa. This is the future of people that want to leverage technology in a meaningful way." So I spend a lot of my time in Africa, coaching, advising and teaching teams how to use technology, how to do product, how to organize themselves as product teams, how to solve problems, and really to create a boldness within the continent for them to go after problems and solve them, than walk around the problems or make money on them.

Lenny (01:20:03):
If people want to learn more about this, maybe support the work you're doing, what's the best way to find out more?

Christian Idiodi (01:20:09):
You can visit the nonprofit website. It's innovateafricafoundation.org. You can follow our work on SVPG or the inspireafricaconference.com. I know I will be doing a lot more next year. In January, I am going to be launching a fund, the Paid Africa Fund, and I want it to be a fund funded by the product community for Africa. It's an angel investment fund. One of the problems I recognize is that so many of the startups, they are not ready for institutional investment, and they are forced into it in some ways. They say people are giving up a lot of equity when they just need cashflow. And so I really want to focus on a fund for the community to enable people to get product market fit in those markets.

(01:20:55):
That'll be launching in January. I'll probably do an announcement about it. I'm excited about that work and to really try to promote more of product-centric thinking on the continent.

Lenny (01:21:06):
Amazing. You should call this fun reference customers or something along those lines, if the goal is to help them find product market [inaudible 01:21:12]-

Christian Idiodi (01:21:12):
That's right. They'll be learning a lot of that.

Lenny (01:21:15):
Christian, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Christian Idiodi (01:21:21):
I've always made an appeal to the product community to really have a sense of what they do beyond the job of a products team or product manager. And I always try to encourage people to see that: at the very core of what you do is really solving a problem. And that's creating... When you do that, create value in the world, you're making a dent in the world. People that participate in trying to make things better or trying to solve problems, and we should not shy from that definition of our job.

(01:21:58):
It might feel like a fluffy one. It might feel too lightweight and not meaningful, but I think when people take to heart that that's really what the essence of products is or product work is, they bring to work a different passion, they bring to work a different sense of empathy, they bring to work a different sense of customer centricity. And all of those things lead to good outcomes.

(01:22:21):
I always make that appeal to product people as like, "Yeah, all the frameworks, techniques, all the stuff, just think truly about what you're trying to do. You're trying to care enough about a problem to solve it on someone's behalf and do it so well that it give us something every time."

Lenny (01:22:37):
I really love that last point of just that's how you know if you've built something people care about. They give you something in return, and one of those things could be actually telling other people about it.

Christian Idiodi (01:22:44):
That's right.

Lenny (01:22:46):
To your point about reference customers.

Christian Idiodi (01:22:46):
Yes.

Lenny (01:22:47):
Amazing. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Christian Idiodi (01:22:52):
I don't have a choice.

Lenny (01:22:54):
Nope. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Christian Idiodi (01:22:59):
Oh boy. In this discipline, probably all of our books: Inspired, Empowered, and we are coming up with one in March, Transformed.

Lenny (01:23:08):
I see that tee shirt there. I see the promo happening.

Christian Idiodi (01:23:10):
Yes, it's happening. It's happening. But it's really a reflection of so many decades of love and passion for product work. And I have not found, I always told Maddie that you write the books after have gone through the failure. It's like, "I've failed at leadership, now there's a book on it. I've failed at product, now there's a book on it." And it reflects really the heart of good product work. I love Ben said the hard thing about hard things I love. There's some books that really describe the mindset and culture that good product work is done in. I always recommend those to people.

Lenny (01:23:43):
Just on this topic of Transformed while we're on it, when is it coming out, and can you give just an elevator pitch for the book just so people know what it'll be about?

Christian Idiodi (01:23:49):
Transformed is coming out March next year. Oh God, just three months. Some people should have gotten shipping dates on their books if you pre-ordered it now. But it really talks about how to move to the product model or the product operating model, which is really this set of beliefs and principles that the best companies work in. We share stories of companies that have transformed into this that are not your traditional bond digital or bond tech companies that have made this transition. We tell stories of what companies can do. If it's anything, it's an appeal that there is a better way of working and solving problems and that companies can work in this way regardless of where you are in the journey.

Lenny (01:24:32):
All right. We'll have to have you back once the book comes out to get more people aware of what is happening. Amazing. Okay, I'll keep going. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Christian Idiodi (01:24:41):
I jumped on the Succession bandwagon, and I enjoyed, and I used to love Billions too as well. I love good writing, really just intellectual media writing business. And so probably Succession and Billions would be two.

Lenny (01:24:57):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing candidates?

Christian Idiodi (01:25:02):
Well, I always give them a problem to solve. That is probably my favorite question, and it's not a traditional problem. I probably will see something like, "Hey Lenny, I have a friend. He's been legally deaf or hearing impaired his whole life, and he just got a new job that requires him to wake up significantly earlier than he normally does. And as you can imagine, traditional alarm clocks will not do it, will not solve the problem. And I would love to give that problem to you. Walk me through how you go about tackling this or solving this." For me, I like that question because it gives me a sense of how you think. It gives me a sense of how you solve problems. It gives me a sense of how you know what you do not know and how you go about knowing the things you need to know, what you need to solve a problem.

(01:25:52):
There's no magical right or wrong answer. I do a lot of people that say, "I have no clue what to do. I'm more curious and because I want to now know what you do, but you don't have a clue." Or people that jump straight to solutions, are more engineering-centric. People that jump straight to... I can get a sense of who you are when I give you a problem that requires you to do some thinking.

Lenny (01:26:15):
And you're doing this live in an interview? It's not like, "Go home and think about this, and then-

Christian Idiodi (01:26:20):
Oh, I'm doing this live in an interview.

Lenny (01:26:20):
Live, okay. And then what's a sign that they're on the right track? What do you look for that's like, "Yes, this is what I want to see"?

Christian Idiodi (01:26:26):
Remember, when I think about what makes a good product manager, I look about collaborative problem solving. There are people that feel like, I'm just going to solve the whole thing myself. This is what we should do. We should do it like no evidence, no data, no kind of stuff in there. It's very interesting. But people that are saying, "You know what? I would need probably work an engineer and designer. We might need to put [inaudible 01:26:46]." I look for intellectual curiosity in some ways, people that have proven questions in your head. People that are very quick to see things [inaudible 01:26:54] people. I will talk to 20 of them. I say, "How you going to do that? Do you know sign language?" And they're like, "Oh, how am I going to talk to them?" There are people that are like, "I'm going to need a lot of help to try to figure this out. I don't know a lot about your friend, but I know..." Some people have frameworks they run to. It exposes that, if they're married to one way of working.

(01:27:14):
It's more about knowing what you can't know. I'm looking for empathy, humility in some sense. It is a competence thing because most of I can teach, I can coach a lot of things, but that arrogance, that ego, those kinds of things, those "I walk alone," those things are very, very challenging and disruptive to a team culture.

Lenny (01:27:35):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like? Either an app or something physical? Anything that's like, "Oh, this is really cool"?

Christian Idiodi (01:27:43):
My eldest son is into sports. He loves all kinds of sports stuff, sports apps, all of those kinds of things, and he got me on this app called Real, like real sports. It's really cool. It shows scores of different games, but it's really driven by social influence. So all of your Twitter posts will get there like, "Oh my God, [inaudible 01:28:07]." It's almost like real time more than real time. You're getting real time with reactions of people around you and your communities.

(01:28:15):
It's a very different way of checking on a score than I've ever seen, and I thought it was just really, really thoughtful in how... I want to share reaction to touchdown with 50 people around the world that will care about my favorite team just got a touchdown, and you'll all share reactions at the same time. And the first person that saw it, you can see it. It's very simple. This is like scores for games, but these days I don't check my scores anywhere else but on it.

Lenny (01:28:45):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends, either in work or in life, that you find useful?

Christian Idiodi (01:28:52):
Wow, boy. I've said a lot in this talk about companies don't care about about you, people care about you. It's never too late to be what you want to be. But early on, my father would always tell me, "Show up. Show up, and you're ahead of 80% of the people in the free world. Show up on time, and you're ahead of 85% of the people in the free world. Show up on time with a plan, and you're ahead of 90% of the people in the free world. And if somehow you have the guts to put that plan to action with a smile, then you probably will have a great chance of success. And if you do that over and over again, every aspect of your life, it can at least lead to successful outcomes." And I think that's a lot of some mental definition for me every day.

Lenny (01:29:37):
Amazing. I love that. Final question: as maybe the most interesting man in the world, is there anything people may not know about you or would be surprised to hear about?

Christian Idiodi (01:29:48):
Wow. I hope there are no surprises about me in that kind of case in that way, but I went to a gifted and talented school. I was out of my house at 12, and I went to kind of boarding school, and I've never been back home since then, so I've kind of been on my own. But we are kind of in the middle of nowhere, probably eight miles from any form of civilization and stuff in the middle of the jungle. No potable water, no electricity. So you kind of had to get water yourself, generate your own power. Probably the most interesting time in my life to shape my worldview, surviving at 12 to 16 on my own in the middle of the jungle. Very intriguing part of my life.

Lenny (01:30:40):
Very different from your life these days. Actually, one more question. I think you're the fourth... You're from Nigeria, right? Your family's from Nigeria?

Christian Idiodi (01:30:47):
Yes.

Lenny (01:30:47):
You're the fourth Nigerian guest on this podcast, I realized. And I always like to ask, what's your favorite Nigerian food slash which food should people seek out if they were to try to find some good Nigerian food?

Christian Idiodi (01:30:59):
My favorite Nigerian is super-duper cultural and native. It's like starch and [inaudible 01:31:06] soup. You can't really find that anywhere, it got to come from mom's cooking. Marty Cagan has tried it. He came to my hometown, my parents' house and had it. But if you are discovering Nigerian food, [inaudible 01:31:18] is a variation of rice, which everybody has, jollof rice, and yes people, I'm going to say this: jollof rice, Nigerian jollof is better than Ghanaian jollof. It's a war, but it's okay. We already claim victory, and we'll move on. But start with jollof rice is elementary, but then you have to try [inaudible 01:31:34] like a pounded yam with a soup. There are many different variations of that. And you get a pounded yam, like pounded cassava, and you eat that with a soup, and you will love it.

Lenny (01:31:45):
Some controversy over here, competition-

Christian Idiodi (01:31:47):
That's right.

Lenny (01:31:47):
... for who's got the best rice. Amazing. Christian, I am now a huge fan of yours. I'm so happy we did this. Thank you so much for making time for this. Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Christian Idiodi (01:32:00):
You can find me on LinkedIn as well. You can reach out to us on our websites svpg.com. I tell people the best fit to be useful to us is to do good work using these principles and all the things we teach people over and over again. We care about outcomes, we care about good product work in the world. I would love your support with the work I'm doing in Africa. I've always reached out to the product community around the world to help developing countries and communities. So please follow our work, please support our work in Africa in building a product community.

Lenny (01:32:35):
And what is the website for that again? Specifically the nonprofit you started?

Christian Idiodi (01:32:38):
Innovateafricafoundation.org.

Lenny (01:32:41):
Amazing. Christian, thank you so much for being here.

Christian Idiodi (01:32:44):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. Such a pleasure.

# The ultimate guide to OKRs | Christina Wodtke (Stanford)

## Transcript

Christina Wodtke (00:00:00):
... people do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, "Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations and oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better." The simple act of getting together and saying, "What was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week? What's the most awesome thing that happened in marketing? What's the most awesome thing that design did this week?" It makes people feel like they're part of something really special, and it's super exciting.

Lenny (00:00:30):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Christina Wodtke. Christina is a multi-time author, speaker, and lecturer at Stanford where she teaches product management, game design, and a few other topics. She also consults with companies on their product development processes, and in particular, their OKR process. Before getting into teaching and consulting, she was a product leader at LinkedIn, MySpace, Zynga, and Yahoo, as well as a founder of three different companies, plus an online magazine called Boxes and Arrows. In our conversation, we go deep into OKRs. What is the atomic unit of an OKR? What might be broken about your OKR process? Why you may want to roll out OKRs or change how you approach them. 

(00:01:20):
Also, how the best companies leverage OKRs, the most common root causes of OKRs going wrong, the elements of a healthy OKR cadence, how OKRs fit with mission, vision, strategy, and roadmaps. We also touch on the skill of storytelling. And she also shares her most contrarian perspective on what new product managers should be focusing on. Christina is a wealth of knowledge and super interesting and fun, and I know you'll learn a lot from her. 

(00:01:45):
With that, I bring you Christina Wodtke, after a short word from our select sponsors. Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on.

(00:02:22):
For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, library actions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's prints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wireframes, draw ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board, and with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O .com/lenny. 

(00:02:58):
This episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights platform for teams that gets you from data to insights fast, no matter the method. There's so much customer data to get through, from user interviews to NPS, sales calls, usability tests, support tickets, app reviews. It's a lot, and you know that if you're building something, hidden in that data are the insights that will lead you to building better products, and that's where Dovetail can help. Dovetail allows you to quickly analyze customer data from any source and transform it into evidence-based insights that your whole team can access. If you're a product manager who needs insights to motivate your team, a designer validating your next pick feature or a researcher who needs to analyze fast, Dovetail is the collaborative insight platform your whole team can use. Go to dovetailapp.com/lenny to get started today for free. That's dovetailapp.com/lenny. Christina, welcome to the podcast.

Christina Wodtke (00:03:55):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm really excited to be here. I've been hearing about you forever. It's so cool to be here in person.

Lenny (00:04:00):
I'm more excited for you to be on the podcast. I kind of see you as the queen of OKRs. I don't know if you like that title or not, but in my mind that's where you sit currently, and partly because from what I can tell, you've done more to help people with OKRs and understand OKRs and fix their OKR process than most anyone else I know. As I'm sure you know, a lot of people just don't like OKRs, are kind of anti-OKR and have had bad experiences with OKRs. And what I want to try to do with our chat today is to try to change people's mind, who are maybe anti-OKR and to help people optimize their OKR process if they're having an okay time with OKRs. How does that sound?

Christina Wodtke (00:04:39):
That sounds just fine, although I have to say in the tech industry, it's a little too easy to be clean. Maybe when I'm a emperor for life, that might be my title.

Lenny (00:04:48):
That might be by the end of this podcast, we will crown you emperor for life. 

Christina Wodtke (00:04:52):
Excellent. 

Lenny (00:04:54):
Okay. That'll be our goal. So, as maybe a first question, I want to give people kind of this confidence that OKRs can lead to great product, great success. What can you share, just to give people a sense of, "Here's how many companies who are having a great time with OKRs, here's the impact OKRs can have on your company if you roll it out or make it more optimal."

Christina Wodtke (00:05:15):
I've seen so many companies do extremely well with it, and I would say that not all companies will be successful, period. Companies are really successful with it are companies that... I think I can swear a little, they have their shit together.

Lenny (00:05:27):
Absolutely. 100%. 

Christina Wodtke (00:05:29):
And the first step is, get your shit together. They have strategy, they have empowered teams, they have psychological safety, and then the OKRs are that extra layer that supercharges them. So, I say OKRs are more of a vitamin, they're not a medicine. So, if you take OKRs and you're like, "Oh, this will fix everything that's wrong with you." No, that's not going to happen. It's just going to reveal everything that's wrong with your company. But if you've done the hard work of getting your company to be strong, it's amazing how well it works. It works really well with startups. It works really well with multidisciplinary product teams. I've seen it over and over. I don't really have permission to talk about all my clients, but I have one client that I'm just working with right now, and it's a purpose built company. So, in other words, they exist in order to make the lives of their customers better, healthier, wellness.

(00:06:20):
And so, they used OKRs to really create this amazing focus on, what does it mean to make everybody's life healthier? And one thing that came out of applying OKRs was this wonderful idea, they're bringing robots into their warehouses, not to replace their humans, they're keeping all the humans, but to reduce the amount of back problems their humans have. So, the humans are doing much more complex tasks, thinking about inventory and how to be more efficient. And the robots are doing the heavy lifting. 

(00:06:51):
They've been growing and growing like crazy. And the OKRs are this very simple way of allowing you to focus on what actually matters and making sure you don't forget in the chaos of everyday life. So, if you know what you're trying to do, then the OKRs just help that happen. It aligns the company. And I think they're a lot like dieting advice, in that they say, "Eat less and exercise more." Well, that's really simple. It's worked for me. I've lost 25 pounds doing eat less and exercise more. But wow, it's hard. It's really hard to do. And I think about OKRs that way. You have to just stay with it and be strong and committed, and that will help.

Lenny (00:07:36):
There's a number of things I want to follow up on in what you said. 

Christina Wodtke (00:07:39):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:07:39):
So, I'll start with, you talked about the benefits of OKR. If you had to just boil down, here's what OKRs can do for you as a company, as an organization, what would that be? What's just the main benefit of OKRs at your company?

Christina Wodtke (00:07:51):
The main benefit is that there's a lot of concrete action through a OKR that you don't always get from strategy. Strategy tends to be a little longer, a little more Muji Muji. And then when you get the OKR, you say, "This quarter is what we're actually going to be doing, and these are the numbers we're actually going to be pushing further." So, that's really good. It creates a cadence of progress, which is incredibly valuable. It creates alignment. There's no question what the single most important thing to do in the company is, assuming you're doing radical focus and you don't have 20 OKRs every quarter. Ugh, don't like to think about that. And last of all, the thing that I don't see a lot of people talking about that I think is really amazing, is because an OKR focuses you for one quarter and at the end of the quarter you grade your OKRs.

(00:08:40):
How well did we do? What got in our way? It creates this learning cycle. So, then you can take that information and say, "Next quarter, what should we try next?" And I think the time is the thing that a lot of leaders really struggle to think about. But if you've been really focusing on say, retention for one quarter, two quarters, and then you go over and say, "Okay, let's work on acquisition." You don't forget all the things you learned about retention. No, you're just building knowledge and building knowledge and building knowledge, which means your company will constantly get smarter and more effective.

Lenny (00:09:13):
I love this. So, just to summarize, the main benefits are focuses you, lines, creates a cadence and creates a learning cycle. And maybe a simple way to think about it is, it's like a plug-and-play product development process. You don't have to invent everything from scratch. There's this thing that exists. I know it's not the whole piece of it, but yeah, maybe... You're nodding and I'm curious, when I say that, what comes to mind?

Christina Wodtke (00:09:36):
Yeah, I guess you have to have a product development process, because obviously otherwise you're just running around chickens with your heads cut off, but it keeps you from making the same stupid mistake over and over and over again, which has been a goal in my life. My motto is, "Make new mistakes." So, by having this focus on really important things, not to spread yourself too thin, like the famous peanut butter memo from Yahoo, which I guess was long ago enough, not everybody remembers it. But companies have a tendency to try to do everything all at this exact moment. And so, everybody's working with 1% on this, 1% on that and 1% on the other. And instead you use the OKRs and say, "Okay, this is the big rock we're going to move. This is the big thing that's going to happen this quarter, and you can fiddle around with all the other stuff if you want, but this one has to move."

(00:10:27):
And then the next quarter, the next thing gets moved and so on. And it just accelerates the speed of your accomplishments so much. It's kind of mind-blowing. I've actually been running my life for the last eight, 10 years on OKRs as well because I'm ADHD and I'm all over the place. And so, looking at my OKRs every single Monday and saying, "Well, am I going to work on a book? Am I going to work on my teaching? Am I going to work... Where do I want to put that attention?" It changes me personally, just like it changes my clients.

Lenny (00:11:00):
What's an example of your personal care? You said writing a book maybe could be one?

Christina Wodtke (00:11:03):
Well, I wish, but no, it's actually been health. One of the great things about managing my OKRs for so long is I discovered this pattern, which is that anytime things get busy, I just stop taking care of myself completely. And that's really bad because if I'm healthy, I can be there for my kid, I can be there for my students, I can be there for my colleagues. So, this quarter's been about setting up habits of well-being and like I said, I've been really pleased at how it's been going.

Lenny (00:11:30):
Amazing. I haven't heard that before. What would you say is kind of the atomic unit of an OKR? So, people talk about, "We're doing OKRs, we're not doing OKRs". What's the line between we have goals and a plan, and we're actually doing OKRs as a concept?

Christina Wodtke (00:11:44):
Gosh, what is the atomic unit? That's a really lovely question. I would say, "What am I doing this week to get closer to our goals?" If you could answer that question, you could give up all the OKR stuff, but if you just asked the question, "What are we doing this week to get closer to our strategic goals, our longer term goals?" That is the very heart of it, because there's the tomorrow problem, like my kid will do his homework tomorrow, and tomorrow never comes. It's always tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. So, what are we doing right now? And I find that it's really useful to tie it into temporal landmarks. 

(00:12:21):
By that I mean that there are things like birthdays or New Year's or Mondays or quarters that are already built into the world. And so, we piggyback onto them and we say, "Okay, it's Q1, boom, we're going to stop. We're going to take a breath, we're going to look at everything and we're going to say, 'What do we actually have to do?'" Raising your head above the noise is really vital. "And then this quarter, remember we have a mission over here and we have a vision and we have a strategy. Okay, this quarter's all about, what?" And you move towards that. 

(00:12:52):
I know there's a lot of talk about outcomes and I think that's absolutely right. It's really critical to think about outcomes because that gives you flexibility on how to attack the problem. But the biggest question is, why? Why do we get up in the morning? What are we trying to actually do? Are we making a difference at all? And if you can say, "This week I'm going to do this," and then at the end of the week you say, "Oh, that worked or that didn't work," and you can try something new or keep going. That's just invaluable.

Lenny (00:13:18):
That is really interesting that your answer wasn't like its outcome or some key results and 70% of success is goal, that there's something more fundamental, which is just being very clear on what you should be doing next week and we should be focusing on now. And that translates into what kind of the OKR process ends up being.

Christina Wodtke (00:13:34):
Oh, yeah. Can I tell you a little story?

Lenny (00:13:37):
Absolutely.

Christina Wodtke (00:13:37):
So, this is personal OKRs, but it works for everything else. It's always easier to talk about personal OKRs because I don't have to do an NDA with myself, so I apologize. But I've had this accountability group with these three women for at least five years, and every Monday we send our OKRs to each other, and I do it the way I do it in the book. Another woman, she had the getting things done approach where it was like, "How percentage did I make and what am I trying to do?" And exactly, super detailed. 

(00:14:06):
And then another woman was like, "Ah, I don't know. I guess I'm trying to think about... What am I trying to think about? Oh, maybe I should think about if I have to get out of product management or not." Well, now the woman who was very precise has kind of disappeared. I think it was just something that she couldn't keep up that level of diligence. While the woman who was hand-waving, she actually has gone from a product manager to a consultant to a life coach, and she's making so much money, and she is so damn happy, and she has a new house. And so, I really do think that the heart of everything is answering that question.

Lenny (00:14:44):
And what is that question?

Christina Wodtke (00:14:46):
What am I doing this week to get to the outcome I really want? Her outcome was to not worry about money and be joyful with what she was doing. And she got that just by every Monday saying, "What the fuck am I doing here? What am I trying to do again?" And it worked.

Lenny (00:15:03):
That is a really cool framework. So, the question you ask yourself every week is, "What am I doing today that's helping me get closer to my outcomes?" Is that the word to use outcome?

Christina Wodtke (00:15:12):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it is an outcome. In her case, it was not worrying about money, having a house, having joy in her work. I think a lot of us get caught up in, do I want to be a writer? Do I want to be this thing? When the reality is, we just want to be satisfied and happy. And with a business, it's the same thing. We get caught up in this or that little details, but you need to go back and say, "What was our mission?" I mean, think about it. How often do companies ever talk about their mission? It's like they set it, they forget it, it's super vague, it's useless. 

(00:15:42):
Instead, it's good to think, "Okay, when we started this company or when we changed this company or grew this company," or whatever you want to go to, there's always these various points in time. "Why? What did we think would work? And let's go back to that moment of meaning and reconnect with it and then make it real in the activities we take every week." And I like every week rather than every day. Because the reality is we still have to do progress reviews and we still have to do accounting and whatnot, but if we just push a little bit each week, over time amazing things happen.

Lenny (00:16:15):
So, I want to drill into some of these things, of just how mission, vision, roadmap and OKRs kind of fit together, just to be pretty tactical. So, as a PM say, or founder, what is the process you recommend for working through mission, vision, and then OKRs, and then roadmap?

Christina Wodtke (00:16:33):
I think it's really important to have a mission, and people get freaked out because they think the mission's forever. And so, they make them super vague so they can do anything. But instead, if you think about it, if the mission lasts for five years, what would you like to see happen in five years? And it might be, "We're going to bring amazing games that delight our users and we're proud to ship into the world." That could be a mission. And it's like, "Okay, I could do that over the next five years." And then, there'll be a point where you probably want to change again. So, you're bringing, what does it mean? What does it mean to be proud? What does it mean to delight people? Really talk about that and get into the nitty-gritty. And then out of that would come your strategy, which is this is going to be our year of exploration, if you have enough money for such a thing.

(00:17:18):
Or this is going to be our year of making our current games a little bit better. I'm in a very game mindset today because I was talking to a client. So, you get into that. Okay, now we have this sort of idea of what we're doing with our year. Now, let's talk about the quarter. And you can use OKRs for the year, but the quarter is where they have the most impact, I believe. Spotify talked about doing quarterly performance reviews because it's long enough to get something done and short enough to not forget what you did. And I think that sums it up perfectly for OKRs as well. So, once you know where you're trying to be, and once you know what you want to do with your year, you can say, "What are the things we want to see happen across these four quarters?"

(00:18:01):
I call it sort of a half-built strategy because too much strategy ties you down and too little strategy, you're too responsive to everything. So, you say, "Okay." Let's say you're building a new game. So, Q1 is about figuring out what it is and what's going to be interesting to users. And then Q2 is going to be about getting some early prototypes out and validating those concepts. And Q3 is about building extensive, and Q4 is about marketing and throwing it out, something like that. And you could venture them into your outcomes. A lot of people who are very venture driven don't understand outcomes, objectives, excuse me, objectives, outcomes, potato, potato.

Lenny (00:18:39):
And they sound horrid.

Christina Wodtke (00:18:39):
It's really something inspiring. Q1, we have a vision for this game that will drive us forward. I don't know, I'm making stuff up, which just means it's going to be imperfect. Although I do warn people not to get too caught up in wordsmithing. We can spend hours doing that. And then, you get to ask my favorite question, how do we know? I love, how do we know? That's how you get to outcomes. So, what does it mean to have a vision for a product we believe will be successful and meet our mission, whatnot? Well, what would it be? How are we going to figure this out? So, something about user testing, probably. Maybe we do a landing page, see how many people are excited by the concept. Maybe we do some technical builds to see if it's actually buildable. What are the sort of things that would tell us, yes, please go forward? We might be excited about VR. Well, how do we know that VR would be profitable for us? 

(00:19:35):
So, once we answer those three, how would we know, then we can know that by March we have the results we need. And we're always going to try to think about the best possible future, the whole moonshot thing, which I'm a fan of, but the reality is, the reason we do that estimating is so we get good at estimating. Everybody sucks at estimating when you first start, and a lot of people think it's like black magic or something you're born with. But no, it's a learned skill. You practice estimating, you get good at estimating, you get better and better and better. And being good at estimating is incredibly valuable as a business skill. So, there's your OKRs, right? And then for Q2, we don't know how Q1 is going to go, so we're just going to leave the objective there, but we're not going to get into the nitty-gritty OKRs. Key results cause a lot of arguing among the team, takes forever to track them down, just wait and see how Q1 goes. And that way you have enough play within your strategy to react to new information.

Lenny (00:20:32):
The question you talked about of, how do we know? That's to decide the objective or the key results?

Christina Wodtke (00:20:39):
Key results, yeah.

Lenny (00:20:40):
Okay, got it. You're saying objective. Okay, cool.

Christina Wodtke (00:20:42):
Objective. My bad. I didn't signal when I turned. No.

Lenny (00:20:49):
Oh, okay, cool. That makes sense.

Christina Wodtke (00:20:49):
Objective is that vision for the quarter. This is what we're we're driving towards in this quarter. And then the key results, you answered the question, how do we know we succeeded?

Lenny (00:20:58):
And so, what was the tip you gave of turning strategy into the objective? How do you translate from strategy to deciding your objective for the core?

Christina Wodtke (00:21:06):
Oh, that sits between mission and OKRs. So, strategy, I've been really shocked lately. I've discovered that lots of companies don't seem to have any strategy whatsoever, which just blows my mind. So, if you think about strategy as a strongly held hypothesis about a way to win in the market and fulfill our vision, then you can say, "Well, our mission is this, or vision..." I kind of use them interchangeably because I think they are kind of interchangeable, and I'm not going to get in semantics in the bitty bits, but the strategy is really important because it says, "We think we're fulfilling our mission of connecting people, by what?"

(00:21:55):
I think that there are a lot of good product strategy pieces out there, but businesses have a lot of questions to answer. Are we going to ship physical products? Are we going to ship digital products? Are we going to be a service? Are we going to do a subscription? Strategy answers those questions. They say, "We're going to have a game. It's going to be an Apple Arcade. We have a hypothesis that's actually going to help us. We're going to build in there and build our customer base there in order to get name recognition, which we can then use on other platforms." That's the sort of strategic stuff. And then we're like, "Oh great, you have a vision. What are we doing? What does that actually mean for us this year, this quarter, and then eventually this week?"

Lenny (00:22:39):
For the actual OKRs you end up with, is it as simple as just with the template of an OKR, is it just objective three-ish key results? Is there anything more to it that you recommend folks use? 

Christina Wodtke (00:22:51):
No. Simple things give you a lot more room to fiddle. And I feel like every time I see people make really complicated methodologies, they get way too caught up in the rules and they don't think about, what are we actually trying to do? So, simple is better.

Lenny (00:23:04):
And what's your rule of thumb for number of key results?

Christina Wodtke (00:23:06):
I like three. I think about it as triangulating. I always like something that's really hardcore numbers. I like something that's a little squishier, like a quality, make sure you don't forget about it. And I usually like something that involves a dollar sign, but it's really going to be specific to what objective you're trying to do. Launch a new product. Well, you probably want to make a certain amount of money, well you want a certain amount of reach, and then you want that delight thing. And then when you get into the delight thing, you can say, "Well, is it going to be Metacritic? Is it going to be a survey? Is it going to be NPS?" You know, could figure out what one makes the most sense for you.

Lenny (00:23:45):
That's an interesting topic. Is there anything you find there to measure customer happiness, satisfaction, delight? What have you seen work best for that sort of squishy stuff?

Christina Wodtke (00:23:53):
I know there's a big backlash against NPS. I think it's okay. It's really funny because you can be insanely successful with a game that people feel yucky to play, and you can be incredibly successful with a product people hate using. Zoom, for example. How many times have you heard Zoom get cussed out? So, the question is, why would I care about that if I'm making money? And I would say the answer is, would you like to keep making money? It's always about retention. 

Lenny (00:24:23):
Right.

Christina Wodtke (00:24:24):
So, anytime you can get strong retention signals, I think those are good signals to get. So, that comes out of qualitative research. There's nothing better. So, if you don't have a qualitative researcher on your team, I think you should get one. You need somebody who knows how to separate what people say and what they do, and what the truth is in that. And then use that to apply to your strategic decisions, so that happy users sell your product for you, right? Happy users stay with your product. Happy users are willing to type an email telling you when you're messing up. I mean, you want committed users. They're just so important.

Lenny (00:24:58):
One final question around the actual OKR document. What do you find are the most one or two common mistakes people make when writing out the objective or the key result in deciding on what to go with?

Christina Wodtke (00:25:09):
Objectives, people make them so fluffy that they don't have any meaning. They really should be a proper goal. We're doing this because we want to see this happen, it matters. We want to delight our customers. Sometimes people make them too fluffy and sometimes they make them too boring. It's like, "Oh, we're going to ship this thing." That doesn't inspire anybody. Your objectives should make you, when your alarm goes off and you wake up, you go, "Oh yeah, I'm changing the world today, or I'm doing something really cool." It shouldn't be like, snooze. So, I think an objective should be motivating but not ridiculous. 

(00:25:42):
And then the key results, it's always going to be tasks. I mean, people put tasks in there all the time, and it can be tricky. Sometimes it feels like a task, like you have to get past a product review, so it's going to have a binary. They either said yes or no. But when you think about it, it is an outcome because it's really hard to get a product review group to say okay to anything. So, making sure that you have real outcomes that let you move forward, I think that's the biggest mistake people make in OKRs.

Lenny (00:26:13):
Yeah. I know you shared a few examples of just that came top-of-mind, but just is there any examples you can think of just, here's a really good example of an outcome? And I think your results are a lot easier, just move this metric 10% or hit-

Christina Wodtke (00:26:25):
Let's try to keep it fairly concrete. You're a online magazine selling interior design ideas. So, what are you trying to do? You're trying to get strong leads out to your advertisers, and that's really important, and you're doing it because you believe that people deserve to have homes that are warm and wonderful. You have this mission, and you want to make money while you do it. So, your strategy is going to be about connecting human beings with the brands that will suit their lifestyle. Okay, that's great. And then we get to the nitty-gritty, well, what does that actually mean? Are we going to really work on recommendations passionately? Are we going to really create various markets and throw down advertising where we think these people are? That's when your strategy comes into play because you're making all these interesting choices. So, let's say we're going to double down on recommendations, which has a lot of presuppositions.

(00:27:23):
We have to get people to like, we have to understand their patterns of behavior, and that's when we can start to go to OKRs. We can say, "Okay, so we have this online magazine, let's really work to get as many people being members rather than browsers as possible, so that we can start understanding what they like." And that's what Q1 could be really about, is starting to collect profiles of people's passions, and that sounds kind of exciting. "Okay, great. We're going to do that. We're going to create a profile of people's passions. Awesome." So, how would we know we were successful? "Oh, gosh. Well, we probably need a bunch of people to do it, but do we really need everybody? Maybe 30% of our audience flips over, and maybe that's right, maybe that's wrong." If you don't know, you just set it and you'll know by the end of Q3, whether you were stupid or not, it's fine, move on.

(00:28:12):
Okay, that's great. Okay, how many things should people do what with? So, they bookmark, favorite, like... How about like? Okay, so maybe they're going to like a certain number of products each week. Let's go for weekly active users. So, they're going to like three things and present it. Okay, so now we've got a couple of numbers that are pretty good. How do we know they're actually kind of liking it? Maybe you decide to do some panels, and we're going to measure using a customer panel, bring them in, have them talk to us, and we're going to do that at the end of every two weeks to hear how it's working and understand more about it. 

(00:28:54):
Okay, now we have some OKRs. With key results, I always recommend spending 10 minutes brainstorming every single way you could possibly measure that outcome. Because with brainstorms, you always think of all the obvious stuff first and then you have no ideas and you're just sitting there with your post notes going, "How long is 10 minutes anyway?" And then you start getting the weird ideas. And often out of those weird ideas are really good insights. So, I recommend some pretty long brainstormings on the key results, but the objective is sort of a manifestation of the strategy at a one quarter level.

Lenny (00:29:26):
Amazing. That was an awesome example. You talked a bit earlier about how OKRs end up being... or sorry, key results end up being tasks for a lot of people. And this reminds me, we had the CPO of Figma on this podcast, and he told the story of how they moved away from OKRs at one point because they found themselves sitting in these meetings reviewing these large spreadsheets of hundreds of tasks- 

Christina Wodtke (00:29:49):
Oh, god. Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:50):
... that were basically just tasks for ICs that they're working on, and they kind of lost sight of why does any of this matter? What are you even trying to do as a company? So, they moved away from OKRs and then they came back to them actually later and fixing some of these issues. So, maybe just as a question, what do you think is a sign that your OKR process is busted and that you need to spend some time improving and rethinking the way it works?

Christina Wodtke (00:30:13):
I think if those meetings are boring, that's a great example. One of the other benefits, which I didn't bring up about OKRs is that they scale really well. One of the biggest problems founders struggle with is they don't scale very well, but if you can set a good OKR and get people to work on it, then you don't have to decide all those little IC tasks. You don't want to be drug down with that. You got a job. CEOs got to figure out what's coming up down the line, not fiddling over everybody's tasks. So, you set the OKRs and then you ask in the meeting, "What are the top three initiatives that you're doing towards them?" Or two or five, whatever. It's going to vary a little bit, but you want to keep it small. You only want to look at the most important stuff and just trust your people to take care of everything else.

(00:30:58):
And then you can say, "Well, why do you think that's important? What do you think that's going to do?" Or, "I've been seeing that for weeks. Are you going to try something else anytime soon?" It's all about those conversations about, is our current strategy, not just at the company level, but at each departmental level, are these strategies working? Are they moving us forward, towards our goals? And so, looking through OKRs, I tell people, "When you first start, it might take a half hour, but after that it should just take 10 minutes." It's like, "I think that's stupid. We should talk about that." Or, "No, it looks fine, looks essentially correct, let's move on. Anybody got anything?" And then you can get into whatever else you do, if it's a metrics review situation or if it's talking about a new deal, the rest of the agenda.

(00:31:43):
But that constant checking in is like touching a lucky stone in your pocket. It reminds you, "Oh yeah, there's this thing, there's this thing." And that rhythm... I'm a teacher, I'm really into learning theory. So, there's a really big concept which is about repetition and retrieval practice. So, retrieval practice means that I put a fact in your brain and I keep asking you to go back and get it again. Qualitative research is really useful for understanding the psychology of your users.

(00:32:15):
I'll say, "Well, how do we understand the psychology of users?" And you'd be like, "Oh, I heard this." Okay, I bring it up. Well, it's the same thing in these weekly meetings, you're practicing retrieving what your OKRs are, and after a while they're just in that long-term memory and you don't have to struggle to think about them and you've got them. And anytime you make a decision and you're in a big rush, you don't want to go through a bunch of paper to try to find what were our OKRs? You just go, "Boo, this is what we should do. I know what we're trying to do and I know how to make a decision about that."

Lenny (00:32:44):
So, what I'm hearing is, a lot of this comes back to, if the meeting is not interesting and boring, change the way you run the meeting. Don't go through everything. Maybe just pick the things that are most interesting and focus on that. You don't have to review every single key result.

Christina Wodtke (00:32:57):
Keep the meeting level at the right place. I'm sorry, I wandered off in a different direction. I get really nerdy around learning theory.

Lenny (00:33:03):
No, I love it. I love learning how to learn. Feel free to share more as things come up. Okay. So, I don't know. I'm trying to think. Figma, I imagine they probably thought they could change this meeting, but I think maybe there's a more deep-rooted issue. And this is kind of where my next question is going to go, is what do you think are just the root issues of OKRs going wrong? 

Christina Wodtke (00:33:24):
Oh, my god.

Lenny (00:33:25):
Maybe that's a symptom of the meeting, they're really boring, but yeah.

Christina Wodtke (00:33:27):
Well, the symptom, it's really wrong. Yeah, it means that you're in the weeds, man. You're fiddling with the little tiny bits. You got to let go of those. You have to trust your people. So, if we do the five why's, okay, why don't you trust your people? Is it you or are you hiring horribly? Okay, if you're hiring horribly, why are you hiring horribly? Is it because you can't find the right people? Is it because you're rushing through it? You have to keep chasing it down. OKRs are a great diagnostic tool because they tell you something's broken. So, if your OKRs are going sideways, something's broken deeper. There's also the problem with psychological safety. You need your teams to be able to say, "This isn't working. We're doing something else." Instead of just saying, "This isn't working, tell us how to fix it."

(00:34:13):
People are coming to you and saying, "How do we fix this problem?" Something's broken in the company. You're doing something wrong as a leader. You have to think about, if somebody doesn't know what to do and you're like, "Well, I have a strategy. I told you what my strategy is." And they don't know how to make decisions, it means something's wrong with the strategy or you aren't being clear, because the conversation always has two people. There's an old joke that I think about a lot, which is, if during the day you meet one asshole, he's probably an asshole. But if all day long you meet nobody but assholes, you might be the asshole. And I think that's very true. If your entire company's confused, you might be the asshole. You have to think about, how can I get more clear? If people are constantly bringing you little things, it's not because they're scared, it's because you're scary.

(00:35:01):
So, a lot of times your OKRs breaking are speaking to something else happening, and if your OKR process isn't working, then you have to step back and go, "Okay, how far deep do I have to go before I figure out what's wrong with my management team?" And it could be the CEO, but it could actually be some weird group dynamics, and you've got to focus on that. I really love Patrick Lencioni. Five Dysfunctions of a Team is his most famous book, and I would recommend that if you like the fable style book. But it's the same thing. You got to fix things at the top, you got to do your own work, and then everything else runs a little better.

If you think back to what most often is the issue, in your experience, is it something at the top? Is it a middle manager doing something wrong? Is it just misunderstanding how to use OKRs? What do you think is usually the issue with OKRs not working well?

Christina Wodtke (00:36:57):
I can repeat everything I said, but instead I'll just say speed. People read, measure what matters. They get their panties in a bunch, they get really excited. They're just going to do OKRs for everybody, but they didn't really read the whole thing. You kind of skimmed it and you don't really understand how it works, and so you just implement it. Or you ask your head of HR to implement it, and it gets implemented and everybody's really happy and then they're really sad and then they spit it out. And then you say, "Okay, OKRs don't work." I mean, that's what I see over and over again. Nobody calls me for advice when they are thinking about OKRs. They call me for advice when they've done it in sales, every damn time. 

(00:37:32):
I think it's... What is it, the illusion of knowledge? If I asked you right now, how does a bicycle work, or how does a pen work? You'd be like, "I know how that works." And if you tried to write it out, you couldn't. Well, I couldn't. How does a ballpoint pen work? Okay, there's a spring and there's some ink. I'm not sure. So, really thinking about, how would OKRs work throughout the company, is valuable. So, because you don't have time as a leader, what you should do is just give my book to your best team and say, "We're thinking about OKRs. Can you guys see if it works?" And then three months later, check in with them. "What did you figure out, guys?" Okay. 

(00:38:13):
Because the best team always wants to be better. I love piloting with the best team, but they're still very imbued in your culture, so they'll figure out where OKRs in your culture don't fit. They'll figure out where it's helpful and then they can give it back to you and you have a template, and then you can take it to two more teams, and then you can take it to two more teams. And maybe you adopt it with your management team, little bit by little bit. That's how I tell people to start with OKRs. Just figure out your best multidisciplinary team team and say, "You guys start and let us know."

Lenny (00:38:44):
This might be a good time to talk a little bit more about your book for folks that are actually planning to roll out OKRs or trying to fix their OKRs. Can you just talk about what it is, how to find it, what it's called, anything else.

Christina Wodtke (00:38:54):
Yeah, it's called Radical Focus. I could have called it Guide to OKRs, but I think what's really important is to learn how to focus on the most important things and make them happen. It is a business fable, as they call it, where I tell a story about two startup founders and their struggle to find focus and how OKRs help them. And then the second half, it's the second edition that's out now, it's gotten twice as big because I started working with big companies as well as startups and had to work through, what does it mean when you have a larger company and what struggles they follow? 

(00:39:27):
And so, I think the first part's nice because it's fun to read stories, but I think what's really good about is what you notice, which is when I talk you through this company trying to figure out what their OKRs were, everything became a lot more clear. And I think that's one of the powers of stories, is seeing an example. And then the rest of it is really like you could almost open it to any page and look at your problem, go, "Oh my problem's with strategy or my problem's with tasks versus outcomes." And you could flip around and figure out, what's the piece I need to solve?

Lenny (00:39:57):
And folks can find it on Amazon if they search for Radical Focus?

Christina Wodtke (00:39:59):
It's everywhere, baby. 

Lenny (00:40:01):
Okay, great. 

Christina Wodtke (00:40:01):
And it's been translated into eight languages, which is pretty cool.

Lenny (00:40:05):
Wow. Which one's your most favorite language it's been translated into?

Christina Wodtke (00:40:08):
Well, Chinese, because it sells like crazy because apparently some Chinese actress said she loved it and then it's been selling bigger there than anywhere else.

Lenny (00:40:17):
So, Chinese actresses using OKRs, what is going on?

Christina Wodtke (00:40:21):
Mind blown. Once again, life is always more surprising than anything you can imagine.

Lenny (00:40:25):
I have more questions I want to ask you about OKRs, but you were talking about storytelling and fables and things like that. So, you also wrote a book about, not that we're going to go through all your books, but you wrote a book about drawing and the power of drawing, and also you just believe in storytelling as a really powerful tool. So, I'd love to hear just your take on why storytelling is so powerful and why skilled drawing is so important for product leaders at the [inaudible 00:40:48].

Christina Wodtke (00:40:48):
I think there are some things that are fundamentally human that are built into our genes. Storytelling's one. If all of human history was a clock, we started writing things down at 11:00 PM, so most of human history has been an oral tradition where we told each other stories to help pass on knowledge. And so, don't get anywhere near the big kitty with the great big teeth because you will die, or don't eat those red berries because my grandfather threw up for three days and then croaked. But we tell them better than that. Longer stories tend to have more conflicts and they tend to be seen as having more information. So, if you use storytelling, you're talking to the most ancient part of the human brain and you will get attention, you'll get comprehension and you'll get retention. The teacher's Holy Trinity, right?. So, I love stories. They work well, they catch people's attention.

(00:41:38):
And one thing I read that kind of blew my mind was, they said that if you tell people a bunch of facts, they'll forget most of them, especially those that don't fit into their current mental model of how the world works. But if you tell them a story that's full of facts, they will remember it. And if you look at TED, everybody loves a TED Talk. They're mostly all just stories, and facts sprinkled inside those stories. So, I think stories are very powerful. I think images are very powerful. Words are very abstract. If I say the word chair, what pops into your brain? Was it a big easy chair? Was it a hard wooden chair? We use these words as if everybody knows what we're talking about, but people don't. 

(00:42:22):
So, in my time in industry, because I was at, what, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Zynga, MySpace, stuff like that, I just found if I got on the whiteboard and drew really badly, and I think it's almost important to draw badly, make some marks, make some squares. Somebody else will go, "No, no, no, it doesn't work that way. Give me this pen," and start doing it. And it gets you so fast to a shared vision of what's going on. I know designers spend all this time making wireframes and I'm like, that's the lamest use of time ever. Just get some whiteboards, go into the room with your engineers and start making some marks together and that just works better. 

(00:42:56):
And I found that for some reason in America, people seem to think that you have to be one of the chosen few and born a drawer. But it's like anything, it's like playing piano, you just got to practice a little bit. So, the book mostly just has some really simple things you can draw, and then it tells you how to use them in business. So, I wanted to make something that was even simpler than Back of the Napkin, which is an awesome book, but gets pretty intense, pretty quickly.

Lenny (00:43:22):
With the storytelling piece, I feel like most people are like, "Yes, I know storytelling is powerful." But they don't know how to do it. Is there one tip you could share? Just how to get a little bit better at storytelling or integrate storytelling into your work as a product leader or founder?

Christina Wodtke (00:43:37):
If you say one tip, you're really holding me down. I would say-

Lenny (00:43:41):
You could do two tips if that makes it easier.

Christina Wodtke (00:43:43):
... when you finish telling a story, if you're telling it to someone you can trust, say, "What's something I could have done to make the story better?" You're going to find out, do I just blather on forever, or do I not give enough details? I mean, if you're only going to do one thing, get feedback, is always the answer. The second tip would be structurally there's a beginning, middle, and end. Intrigue people with a hook, a mystery. That's the beginning, right? A mystery, a secret, a surprise. The middle is, you can tell them a little bit about it. That's where you get your message in. If you're trying to pitch something, sneak your product in, whatever. And the end is always going to be success and celebration because you're trying to get people excited about your story or remember this information. So, just a basic structure in your head really, can kind of make a big difference.

Lenny (00:44:29):
Yeah, I love that. That's such a actionable, straightforward tactic for getting better, just ask people, "How could this have been a better story?" Great idea. Your second piece made me think about the Minto Pyramid. Do you know much about, do you work with that at all? The Minto Pyramid principle?

Christina Wodtke (00:44:45):
I had a Minto binge for a little while, but I moved onto other stuff. I do.

Lenny (00:44:45):
I think it was a triangle. 

Christina Wodtke (00:44:45):
Yes, but I can't recount it to you. I do remember it.

Lenny (00:44:54):
I was just going to ask because it's kind of the reverse concept, which is, you start with the conclusion and then you kind of share how you got there.

Christina Wodtke (00:45:01):
I think that's a good one. I mean, if you think about what's the job of a hook, a hook just gets you excited. So, how do you get people excited? You can start with a conclusion. There's going to be success. Oh, tell me more. I want to be successful. It could be a mystery. Ooh, what's happening there? I want to be part of that. It could be a secret. Something happened and I'm not going to tell anybody else, but I'm going to tell you. There's so many ways to hook people in, but they're all doing the same job because you want people to actually listen to you and not pretend and nod. So, I think you can do it backwards as well. But I bet even when Barbara Minto did it, she probably opened with a success and ended with a success, I would bet good money, to remind people that there's a happy ending and the story's worth following.

Lenny (00:45:42):
That's a really interesting perspective because to me, there were opposites of build tension and you reveal the answer. The Minto approach is start with the answer. Here's what we're going to do and here's why, and here's all the work I did to get there. Your point is, that's also really interesting. You're like, "Oh wow. I don't know how you got to that."

Christina Wodtke (00:45:56):
There's so many ways to tell a story. Just don't bore your users.

Lenny (00:46:00):
Great advice. Okay, I want to come back to a couple more OKR questions. It could be less fun than the story maybe, but hopefully more useful. I want to just get your take on what is the cadence of a healthy OKR process? What are the ceremonies and meetings and emails that are involved? I know you have this kind of weekly status email practice. Do you recommend... How do you describe the system of an OKR process?

Christina Wodtke (00:46:23):
Oh my gosh, I'm glad you asked because I think the cadence is probably the single most valuable piece of it. So, every Monday, because Monday is a great temporal landmark, look at your week, and you go, "Okay, what am I going to do to move the ball forward?" And it could be an email to your boss, it could be an email to your accountability group, could be an email out to your team, could be standing there like standup. I mean, it's very easy. OKR rituals were built on agile rituals. So, there's a lot of connections there, which is great. 

(00:46:52):
So, you just, Mondays you commit and Fridays you celebrate. People do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, "Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations. And oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better." The simple act of getting together and saying, "What was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week? What's the most awesome thing that happened in marketing? What's the most awesome thing that design did this week?" It makes people feel like they're part of something really special and it's super exciting. 

(00:47:25):
So, you have these [inaudible 00:47:26] bookends and I think if you only do that, you're probably in good shape. I think status emails, I hated them so profoundly for most of my life. I had this huge team at MySpace and my project manager would gather everybody's status emails and put them together into this giant status email that I had to send to my boss. And I was so busy, I just sent it forward figuring it was fine. And then I read it and there was this really bad thing in my status email that should not have happened.

(00:47:51):
I was like, "Fuck." And I waited to hear back from my boss, and nothing. Apparently he wasn't reading them either. So, I was like, "What's the point of the stupid thing?" And then when I was at Zynga, we were using OKRs and they were really short. They were like, "What's your confidence level on your key results? What did you do last week? And what are you doing next week?" And the last week, next week is great because it allows you to start noting down what stops you from getting shit done. And that, I got to say, there's so much learning in that. I tried to do this, but what? Did I get sick? Did somebody get mad at me? Did somebody not want to work with me? Do we not have this critical database? The whole, I tried to do this last week and I failed, learning goes through the roof.

(00:48:38):
And that rhythm of just having three P1s, you can't have more than three P1s. You can have as many P2s as you want and P3s if you really think you should, but you can scam it... scam it. You can skim it, right? Go through it really quickly. And we would all send them to emails. You could subscribe to email lists, which meant I could read the status emails of most of the company, and I would know what was going on and I could quickly see who should I go over and talk to, and who should I make a connection with? So, those emails were invaluable. I think a lot of my clients are doing it in Slack now instead. And that works really well, if you have this place where you're putting your status in and people will quickly go, skim, skim, skim, skim. "Oh, okay. I got to talk to that guy." So, it's hyper valuable.

Lenny (00:49:20):
If you assume others, the OKR doc, you're like, "Here's our outcomes for the quarter. Here's our three key results." You make that plan once a quarter. You have any recommendation how long to spend on planning your OKR?

Christina Wodtke (00:49:32):
My goal is always as little as possible. Time you're planning is not the time you're shipping, and the best is the enemy of the good. So, in an ideal world, you would grade your OKRs week at the end of the quarter, maybe second to the last week of the quarter, depending on it. If it takes you a whole week to set OKRs, which I hope it doesn't, but who knows. And then the very last week you set your OKRs for the next quarter and that's it. 

Lenny (00:49:58):
Cool. 

Christina Wodtke (00:49:59):
Boom. If you can do it at in a... usually you can do it in four days total, unless you have a very hierarchal, huge deep bench. And even then, I have something, I'm going to share this with you because I don't think many people talk about this. The approval process will kill you. I've seen it happen over and over again. I was working with one of my clients and we came up with this different kind of approval process that's working really well, is that basically instead of having your boss approve it, you write your OKRs, you get three... I'm a big fan of the rule of three, because I'm a storyteller, but you could do less or more, I guess, teams that work with you enough to know what you're up to, to look them over and they just look them over, 24 hour turnaround. 

(00:50:43):
They say, "This looks right, but I don't think this is possible." They give you that feedback and you're done. That's it. That's the entire approval process, and it's so fast and it works so well. And that means you might have to say no to somebody if they're asking you to do more than... if you had 10 teams asking you to look over their OKRs, you have to say no. You want to keep it down to a reasonable number, but if you do one a day, it could be done in a week.

Lenny (00:51:09):
I'm thinking about companies the size of Airbnb when I left, trying to do it that quickly. And it's hard to imagine, partly because there's top level strategy that has to align with individual team roadmaps and dependencies, and platform teams and things like that. So, I imagine it's hard to do as the company's scales. I like the drive to make it a week and be done.

Christina Wodtke (00:51:29):
Well, I mean, who really has to approve it and what does it cost you if you get it wrong? And so, if tech looked at it, if somebody from strategy looked at it, if somebody from sales looked at it, whatever, the right people looked at it, you're probably fine. And if you're not right, you'll figure it out over the quarter and do better next quarter. We have to let go or we will get mired down in all this crap.

Lenny (00:51:57):
I love that. I went off track, but just to kind of put a ribbon on the concept of OKRs, you have this document with your object, your outcomes, your key results, and then your recommendation is do a weekly email. And is the idea everyone on the team sends this weekly email or Slacks to the rest of the team?

Christina Wodtke (00:52:15):
To the rest of the company if you can.

Lenny (00:52:18):
Wow. Okay. [inaudible 00:52:19].

Christina Wodtke (00:52:19):
That's the thing, is Google, even as a huge company, everybody's OKRs and their weekly updates are on their intranet. You can look stuff up, so why not?

Lenny (00:52:28):
Got it. And we'll link to a template that you have on your blog post. And also I think in the book, I imagine you have this template of what it is, but essentially it's your confidence level of hitting your OKR, what you did last week, what you're going to do next week.

Christina Wodtke (00:52:40):
And then a few notes if you need to.

Lenny (00:52:42):
Does this replace stand-ups in your experience?

Christina Wodtke (00:52:45):
It could. I never try to tell engineering how to get their shit done, but if they felt like it was doing the same job, then they could combine them.

Lenny (00:52:56):
Cool. Okay, great. And is there anything else? Is this the whole OKR process, in your experience?

Christina Wodtke (00:53:01):
The only other thing I would bring up is thinking about the word grading. So, a lot of people think about trying to make something really numerical, like 0.08, I got 80% of the way there, but a lot of times they're qualitative. So, how do you think about that getting approved by the product committee? So, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Don't get fussy. Don't try to make it really precise. Just go ahead and say, "Ah, hand wave, hand wave, 80%." What matters is, why 80%? Really focus on the learning. So, we almost got there. Well, if we would've gotten there, if we got two more days, that's fine. We basically got there. We knew what we were doing. If we didn't, if we were really far away, what went wrong? 

(00:53:44):
It's all about the retrospectives. Make sure your grading is secondary to retrospective, is the biggest thing I would say, because that's what's going to be valuable. And you could spend so many hours trying to come up with some fake measurement system that never is quite accurate and just wastes everybody's time when you could just be faster. I'm just obsessed with speed. You may have noticed that.

Lenny (00:54:03):
I thought it was 70%, is that 80% is success? Is that the rule of thumb for OKRs?

Christina Wodtke (00:54:07):
It's about 70%. Some people do 80%, some people do 0.075, I don't know. My feeling is, a good goal is one that makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable but not doomed. You're like, "Woo, that's kind of good, that's going to be tricky. Okay, let's go for it." That's about where I like to land with a key result.

Lenny (00:54:29):
I had a newsletter post with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he made this point that OKRs were created by Google, which is the most incredible business model in history. They just print money, and for them it's okay not to hit their goals, like 70% of goal is fine, it'll be fine, we're making so much money. And so, his perspective for most companies, it doesn't make sense to set the goal to be like 70% of this goal you set is a success. Do you have a perspective on that?

Christina Wodtke (00:54:57):
I think you'll never know what you're capable of unless you try to do something that you're not sure you can do.

Lenny (00:55:01):
I agree. I find setting more ambitious goals than you think you can immediately achieve actually really pushes you to achieve them.

Christina Wodtke (00:55:08):
And the literature agrees. There's a lot of literature that shows ambitious goals are actually quite motivating unless you feel you're doomed, at which point then they're demotivating.

Lenny (00:55:16):
I've seen that too. Okay, two more OKR questions. One is, I noted this from before so I'm just going to come back to it. There's a balance with key results of, as you've talked about, being very precise and metrics-driven and focused. And then there's, you talked a bit about sometimes it's okay for them to be a little fuzzy, like quality and delight, and those latter ones are harder to measure, it's hard to keep people accountable. Do you have any advice for just how to find that right balance of, this is what will keep you accountable, and this is how we drive the business forward, and this is how we know you're doing a good job, versus here's a general thing that we think is success and it's fine. Do your best.

Christina Wodtke (00:55:57):
Yeah. One of the most common arguments I have with my friends is I think everything can be measured to a certain degree. Not precisely necessarily, but you can get enough of a swag to be useful. So, by trying to measure things, you'll start learning how to measure things. So, you maybe try NPS and you're like, "Wow, this is not actually accurate, or weird, or not." There's a lot of stuff we don't know until we try them. And of course, my background is in lean and agile and design and they're all iterative. They're all about, let's try something and then learn something and then do something. Which is why I'm so fanatically iterative. So, I think that when you got these fuzzy things, you just got to start trying out ways to measure it and trust the team to be able to figure out whether it's working or not.

(00:56:46):
Revenue, it's easy. This is what we're making now, this is what we could be making. Or you're not making anything now, so you can look up some numbers from public companies or whatnot. That's easy. DAU, it's easy. Acquisition numbers, it's easy. But when it comes to will people stay, do people actually like this? That's harder, but it's not impossible. There's a lot of user researchers who have worked hard to figure out how to measure it.

(00:57:15):
So, you can either buy the obvious off-the-rack package like an NPS, or you can dig a little harder and figure out what would be meaningful to your company. And I think there's a desire not to do things that are hard and take a little bit longer, but that's where you're going to get the super value. That's how you become the next Netflix or Amazon or whatnot. So, you really got to say, "How will we know about our product and what are the approaches are out there and which one makes sense for us?"

Lenny (00:57:47):
Final OKR-related question. Say someone's listening to this and they're like, "Wow, this is awesome. I want to do this at our company, we have a focus problem, we have alignment problems, we need to be more clear about what we're working on." Other than buying your book and reading it and sharing with everyone, what would you recommend would be the first few steps to work along that journey to rolling out an OKR process at the company?

Christina Wodtke (00:58:09):
I hate to say this, but there are a lot of consultants that have popped out of nowhere and it's kind of terrifying because so many of them really, really suck and they're just like, "Oh, OKR sounds like SMART goals or whatever, I'll just use that." Or it's hot, and so I'm going to figure it out by reading some articles. And so, I would ask for references. I think that's a good one.

Lenny (00:58:33):
So, your advice is find someone to come in and help you figure out how to do this well and find the right person.

Christina Wodtke (00:58:40):
Yeah, I guess I think that finding someone to coach you is really high value, but I also think it would be okay if you just read a book or read a bunch of blog posts and start experimenting. It's not rocket science. You just listened to this podcast, listen to it again. Take lots of notes, Google around, see if you can learn a little more about some of the concepts that you didn't fully understand or you want to know more about. And then just run a tiny pilot and say, "Okay, what does this mean for us?" You don't even have to call them OKRs. You can just try, "We're going to do a outcome focus this quarter and let's see where it takes us." But just try it because that's where you learn stuff. And try it at a small, safe level where you don't think it's going to hurt too many things.

Lenny (00:59:25):
And you said to start with a high performing team. 

Christina Wodtke (00:59:27):
Oh, yes.

Lenny (00:59:28):
[inaudible 00:59:28] point.

Christina Wodtke (00:59:28):
Because they're smart, they're capable, and if anybody's going to figure out how to make it work, they will. If you try to fix a bad team with OKRs, you'll make everybody hate OKRs and make the bad team worse. So, just don't do that. It's not a medicine, but that high preferring team, they're going to be the ones who go, "Oh, well, okay, our stand-up's like this, so we should add this to standup. And then instead of emails, let's just have a brag channel on our..." I've seen people do the coolest stuff with OKRs, totally changing what I recommend, doing wonderful things with it, just because they're smart and they messed with it till it worked.

Lenny (01:00:03):
Awesome. Final question in topic. You teach product management at Stanford. What's maybe a surprising or contrarian opinion about how to learn to do product management, how to get into product management, how to do product management, from your experience teaching young PMs?

Christina Wodtke (01:00:22):
I taught it and a bunch of students who thought they were going to be product managers realized that they wanted to be interaction designers and not product managers at all. I think one of the things that might be off with a lot of the product management education and conferences is, it's good that they take a lot from UX and it is important to be people-centered, but the reality is the product manager serves the business. That's their role. Teresa Torres talks about the product trio, right? Trio.

Lenny (01:00:52):
Trio.

Christina Wodtke (01:00:53):
Trio. She's talking about business and user experience and technology. So, if product's over here messing with the user experience or products over there, messing with engineering, who's taking care of the business? And I think it's absolutely critical product managers, they say they're the mini CEO, but that just means they want to be in charge and nobody's in charge. It's all about working together as a team. So, they need to understand business models, they need to understand how to do a target market, and what is a target market, why is that target market the right one to go after, and how is it going to grow, and what are the trends that are going on that's going to change the business? 

(01:01:29):
Product managers need to serve the business and it's not a bad thing. If you have a company, it needs to survive and all money is, is oxygen, it lets the company keep going, unless people are being greedy assholes, which definitely happens. But it's okay to care about the health and well-being of the company's ability to make money and feed itself. And don't do anything unethical, but really focus on these questions. And if you don't know business models, if you can't talk about why you might want to do a subscription or if you want to just do one-off sales, if you don't understand why you know have all these in-app purchases in your mobile devices, go learn it. I'm really shocked at how many product managers are just smart people who care about users and just showed up and said, "Yes, I will be a product manager." So, no, business is a real thing. It has a long history of knowledge and understanding, and go do that.

Lenny (01:02:30):
What I'm hearing is, maybe product sense is overrated in your experience.

Christina Wodtke (01:02:34):
Ain't none of them yet old enough to have product sense. I mean, seriously. Product sense is intuition, intuition is compressed experience, compressed experience comes from having lots of experience. And if you're young and you don't have a lot of experience, the smartest thing you could do is learn. You've got to learn what models work and why they work, and just intuition is overvalued and under-exists.

Lenny (01:03:01):
Imagine that's kind of freeing to a lot of people listening, where they're like, "Man, I just don't know if I have product sense. How do I learn product?" All this. Yeah, don't worry about it is what you're saying. Any other advice for just people thinking about getting into product or trying to get into product other... Many can't get to Stanford and learn product from someone like you. What else would you suggest they do to try to help them get into a product management role? What other activities or areas they should spend time, in your experience?

Christina Wodtke (01:03:30):
I think I agree with my friend Ken Norton on this, in that you shouldn't probably start in product. Go be an engineer or be a designer, work, get to know businesses. And I got into product from, well, I was a developer and then I was a designer, and both of those gave me a lot of knowledge. But when I moved into product, it came out of my startup where I had to learn business, and I absolutely had to learn business or else I wasn't surviving. So, I would say work for a company that's small enough that you can poke into the corners and learn from other people, and learn and then do stuff. 

(01:04:11):
I don't know, it's funny because I'm at Stanford, which is all fancy with a degree and stuff and I'm like, "No, no, no, just read up, go hang out with people, get a job, figure it out." Because that's very much how I did it. And I think that if people want to get into product, I'd ask, "Why? Why do you want to be in product? Do you want to be in charge?" I learned that nobody's in charge. No matter what you do, you have to use your influence, you have to use your people skills. 

(01:04:34):
Are you willing to work on your interpersonal dynamics? Because if you can't fire someone, if you can't tell somebody their behavior is interfering with the ability to get things done, don't be a product manager. If you can't solve the fight between two of your coworkers, don't be a product manager. If you can't go out and talk to somebody in a Starbucks line and say, "Hey, we're working on this new thing, what do you think?" Don't be a product manager. You got to have hustle. You got to talk to people. You got to always have your eye on the bottom line.

(01:05:00):
Maybe you don't want to be a product manager. Maybe it's much more fun to leave work every day at 6:00 and be a designer and think about how all the systems work and how and where the error message is going to come in, and is blue the right color, all the combinations of that, that's fun. Or you really want to be an engineer and solve puzzles all day. Product manager is probably the worst job unless you love talking to everybody and connecting them and stepping into the mess.

Lenny (01:05:24):
I definitely agree. There's not enough talk about how painful and hard the PM role is and how thankless it often is.

Christina Wodtke (01:05:29):
And I love it, but I love everything. I fell in love with the web and I haven't stopped, even though it's now mostly on phones and stuff. It's an exciting space. But yeah, you got to step up and do the hard stuff.

Lenny (01:05:42):
That is an awesome way to end it. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I just have six quick questions. I don't know if you know they are, so let's just go through them and see how it goes. Are you ready?

Christina Wodtke (01:05:53):
I love it.

Lenny (01:05:54):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Christina Wodtke (01:05:59):
The Fearless Organization. I think that book on psychological safety is the bomb. It's so, so, so good. For fiction, I loved The Overstory. It's about trees, and it's mind-blowing and so good. I'm going to leave it at that. Less is better.

Lenny (01:06:17):
I tried reading The Overstory and it's very long, but beautiful.

Christina Wodtke (01:06:20):
It's a lot like Cloud Atlas. If you liked Cloud Atlas, you'll like The Overstory.

Lenny (01:06:24):
I think I watched that movie.

Christina Wodtke (01:06:25):
No, a terrible movie. Only read the book.

Lenny (01:06:28):
I agree. Speaking of movies, what's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Christina Wodtke (01:06:33):
We just saw Wakanda Forever and it's a very different movie than Black Panther, and my kid and I spent quite a bit of time talking about it and what it meant and it was a lot deeper than I expected. And I'm very passionate about the Mayan people because I live in Belize part of the year, and I don't know, the Mayans are just the OGs of everything, invented zero, writing. They're just so amazing.

Lenny (01:06:56):
Love it. Next question, favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people.

Christina Wodtke (01:07:01):
What questions should I have asked you? I've been using that one forever, whether I am interviewing somebody or being interviewed, because the person is an expert in themselves. And if you say, "What question should I have asked you?" A lot of times they'll be like, "Oof." They'll be knocked off-base and then they'll give you a really honest answer.

Lenny (01:07:20):
What are five SaaS products or tools that you just love and use constantly?

Christina Wodtke (01:07:24):
Oh, I hate all technology. That's what the problem is, if you've been a product manager and a designer, all you can see is the flaws. But I would say I like Zoom better than you might think. It's terrible, but it's better than everything else. Slack, when I saw it, I was like, "This is not going to get rid of email. This is just going to be another channel of nonsense." And that showed up. But I do use it. God knows, I use it. 

(01:07:48):
The Google Suites, I got to say the Google Suite is pretty amazing. Most people think that the students who go to Stanford are all rich, but 70% of them have huge amounts of financial aid. And so, I'm always looking for things that are free and won't cost too much for these students. So many of them are first generation, the first student who's gone in their family here. So, having the Google Suite and being able to have free slides, free docs, everything interconnected, Drive is sort of a gift. So, I've got to say I love those.

Lenny (01:08:20):
Cool. I didn't expect the question to go in that direction, but I love it. Two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've seen a company you've worked with change in their product development process that's had a tremendous impact on their ability to execute and ship crates?

Christina Wodtke (01:08:35):
I will never forget when people stopped sitting with their disciplines and started sitting with their teams. I think that we in tech want everything to be tech and be remote and everything, blah, blah, blah. And there are definitely jobs that are wonderful remote, but if you're trying to innovate, there's nothing like getting the product trio to sit together, and preferably with walls. Walls are really underrated. If you can just give them a war room where they can put stuff on the wall, or I hate to say it, cubicles, I'd rather see offices, but if you can give people walls, it becomes part of your memory. And then you're not using your short-term memory to remember stuff. You're using it to think, and so the war room becomes a living memory so you can make connections. I mean, it's one of the hardest things I have to teach my students too, is that some things are just better done analog and that's okay.

Lenny (01:09:27):
Reminds me of a story I just heard from a friend where there was a team sitting next to a data science team and they were one table apart. They're right next to each other. And the data team just had a lot of concerns with what that team was building. They didn't believe in what they're doing and they're just like, "Why are we wasting these resources on this thing?" And the head of data science put one of the data people on the team and had them sit just one table over with the team and everything changed. They're just like, "Okay, let's do this. This is great. We're going to build some awesome products." 

Christina Wodtke (01:09:55):
We're human.

Lenny (01:09:56):
Just that one move.

Christina Wodtke (01:09:58):
We are human. We are social. Yeah, and I think moving people around every year or so, everybody hates it. Nobody wants to change desks, but do it to them anyway. It always makes things better.

Lenny (01:10:07):
Final question. What's a company that you think has a really strong and effective product culture? If you can name one, if not, that's okay too. 

Christina Wodtke (01:10:14):
Well, I think of all my clients, the best cultures all seem to be very small companies working in strange little corners of the world. They're not the big, sexy guys. Everybody's there because they want to make dog food or they want to make this kind of financial software, and they're amazing. I think we treat scale like it's a virtue when it's merely a tactic, and it might be a bad tactic as well. So yeah, I think there's something really sweet around 250 people working on something that everybody agrees is important.

Lenny (01:10:49):
Christina, I honor you as emperor for life of OKRs. 

Christina Wodtke (01:10:54):
Woo.

Lenny (01:10:54):
You've achieved it. I'm very proud of you. I think we've made a big dent in how people perceive OKRs and will utilize OKRs. 

Christina Wodtke (01:10:54):
I hope so.

Lenny (01:11:03):
Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Christina Wodtke (01:11:10):
If they want to learn more, I've been blogging at eleganthack.com, like a hack writer since 2000. It's where I've dumped my thoughts for a long time, so it's always a good place if you want to go spelunking about anything. If you want to attempt to hire me, cwodtke.com is not a bad place to go. I say attempt because I teach, and so I don't have a lot of time. But you know what users could do? Users could slow down. I just wish everybody would take a deep breath and think about, "Okay, we're going to adopt this thing. Let's read up on it. Let's think about it. Oh, we're going to build this new product? Let's do a literature review, let's do a competitive analysis. Let's see what's been done. Let's learn from the past."

(01:11:55):
I think if you could slow down, you'll end up going a lot faster. So, I would encourage people, if you're in a panic and you're in a tizzy, and I know the economics bad and the world's on fire, but just take some deep breaths before you do anything and just ask yourself, "What's a good way to do it? What's a good way for me to move forward?" I think I would like to encourage that.

Lenny (01:12:16):
A beautiful way to end it, but I also want to make sure you plug your books. Just say the titles of your books and where people can find them, and then we'll [inaudible 01:12:24].

Christina Wodtke (01:12:23):
Radical Focus. Get the second edition. The Team That Managed Itself. And Pencil Me In. Those are my three books that are out there right now. You can get them pretty much anywhere I do believe, but definitely, I mean Amazon. Amazon rules us all, so they're definitely there.

Lenny (01:12:40):
Amazing. Christina, again, thank you for being here. We'll all go slow down right now.

Christina Wodtke (01:12:44):
Thank you so much for having me here, Lenny, and sharing your audience with me. It's been an honor.

# Understanding the role of product ops | Christine Itwaru (Pendo)

## Transcript

Christine Itwaru (00:00:00):
Speaking as a former PM, I would not ever give up spending time with customers and watching their pain. That's how I fell in love with product was I saw my internal customer 12 years back now fighting with the keyboard, fighting with the mouse, and I was just like, "Oh, my gosh. What's this guy doing?"
Lenny (00:00:23):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Christine Itwaru. Christine is a long-time product ops leader at Pendo, a role that she transitioned into from product management. I've been hearing more and more about the rise of product ops and I've never really understood what the role was until I have this conversation with Christine. 
(00:00:49):
We dig into what product ops people do day to day, where the line is between their role and product management, whether you should consider getting into the role, whether your company would benefit from product ops. We also have an interesting discussion around whether ops roles in general are a sign of inefficiency at your company. I learned a ton from this conversation and Christine is awesome. So, with that, I bring you Christine Itwaru after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Christine Itwaru (00:02:37):
Thank you. I'm so happy to be here, Lenny.
Lenny (00:02:39):
First of all, I just wanted to give a big thank you to Ben Williams who is a previous guest on this podcast who suggested you join this podcast and who connected us. We were chatting earlier and you said you have a story about Ben. So, what is that? 
Christine Itwaru (00:02:51):
I do. Absolute thanks to Ben for connecting us. So, when he made the intro, I was super excited, one because it's you, and two, because I love hearing from Ben. I was like, "Oh, great, he's doing all these wonderful things and whatnot." I just remember in that moment, my first conversation with Ben, which was really early in the days of starting product operations at Pendo and we were going through all these just really crazy things that he was going through and his team was a customer of Pendo at the time. He's sitting there just staring and I was like, "Oh, you're okay?" He was like, "Yeah, I'm fine. I thought that I was just throwing them off at every return." 
(00:03:28):
He said to me, "I bet you I'm not the only person who has these questions and I bet you I'm not the only person that's thinking about all these problems that probably seem very normal and natural." I don't know. All of us are going through this. This is why I'm building product ops here. But what he said and he was just like, "I really think there are a lot more people that you need to talk to about this stuff." It's just full circle. I think he connected us and he was one of the reasons I started to say... One of the best things that my first boss product always told me was, "You have to find a way to give back." When he said that to me, I was like, "I wonder if this is one of the ways that I can start to give back to the product community."
Lenny (00:04:08):
Awesome. Well, here we are, and obviously, we're going to be talking about product ops. You've been in the product ops role for seemingly feels like as long as the role has existed. I'd love to know when you think the role actually and we're going to talk about just when this spurred happened in product ops. I hate this term, but it feels like you're a thought leader in the product ops space. I've never actually worked with anyone in product ops. I've never had a product ops team, so I have a ton of questions. I imagine many people listening also have and are also just curious about this emerging role. 
(00:04:38):
So, what I'm hoping we do with our chat is to help people understand, "Do they need a product ops team? Would that be beneficial to their company? Whether people should be consider moving into product ops, whether they're in PM or something else right now, and then just generally helping people understand this emerging role of product ops." Does that sound good? 
Christine Itwaru (00:04:56):
Yes, thank you, number one. That was really kind. Two, yeah, I'm happy to dive in. Yeah. 
Lenny (00:05:01):
Okay, sweet. So, I think we have to start with the basics. What's just the simplest way to understand the role of product ops, especially in relation to product management? 
Christine Itwaru (00:05:11):
I've had many ways of describing this in the past and it generally centered around the ladder of what I'm going to tell you or the second part of this, but I'm breaking it down now into two simple things. One is it is a thing you do. Product operations for a VP or a head of product or a product manager is the creation of some system that allows you to thrive or allows your team to thrive in product management. The second is what we've seen more of over the last couple years, and it's the more common definition. 
(00:05:44):
The emergence of the role itself is why it's so common. It's a person or the people, the group of individuals who are strong partners to the product manager and then for more mature product ops teams end up people being more strategic advisors to the head of products. So, your CPO or your VP again. When it comes to data, qualitative, quantitative, anything that they feel can help the CPO or the head of product make more strategic decisions and well-informed decisions. 
Lenny (00:06:11):
Got it. It feels like there's been this big inflection and emergence of the role in the past couple years, past few years. I'm curious what you think triggered that and if that's true, if it feels like it's just emerged in the last couple years and then just like why do you think that has happened? 
Christine Itwaru (00:06:28):
This is interesting, because as a former product manager and product leader, I don't think that things are new. Absolutely. When I go back to the story about Ben, I'm like, "No, none of this stuff feels really interesting and it's just stuff that we had to deal with in product." So, the problems have always been there. I think maybe that is because I have a product background. So, I felt that pain very acutely, but I will say for the majority of people I always speak to who don't have that product background, they're coming from consulting or from technical success or from some other group marketing maybe, it does feel relatively new because they're starting to dive into that space a little bit. 
(00:07:06):
But I will say that for me in particular at Pendo, it was the summer of 2019 that this really picked up and I remember a colleague of mine, shout out to Shannon. He's no longer with us, but he is one of the original people on the Pendo product team. He said, "I think this is the summer of the birth of product ops." I just started laughing and he was like, "I'm telling you, it's everywhere." All of a sudden, everybody's just like, "We need something. We need to make product better." I thought that was awesome because we had already started talking about it. 
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]So, it took me a bit to understand what was going on across tech that was making this thing so big. I'm very grateful because we have so many great customers that reach out and say, "Help us understand how you're doing this." I'm like, "Well, help me understand what's going on." So, for me, it went beyond the problems that we would solve as a product team with the Pendo product. It went into, "How can we help you as an organization solve pain that you're feeling within your product team that trickles out to the business?" 
Lenny (00:08:07):
That's interesting. That was the summer of product ops. What happened there? Why was there a summer of product ops? Why was everyone starting to get excited and creating product ops teams? 
Christine Itwaru (00:08:17):
Yeah, I'll dive in. The customers started to come up and we started to feel it a bit more and I felt like there was this huge need for a voice of customer management and synthesis of both this qualitative and quantitative data as a theme that I saw arising across our customer base or even just folks that were reaching out about this role as they saw Pendo was putting it down. There was a lot of pain around internal alignment in general, transparency to stakeholders up across your revenue team members. Then for a lot of people during this time, growth was a massive propeller of the need for product ops. I remember just sitting here in this office and getting these random... 
(00:08:58):
Every industry almost was like, "Yeah, I'm thinking about doing this and I really need to do this, the pandemic, blah, blah, blah." Because it was growth during the pandemic, especially within industries such as home furnishings and making their living space a whole lot better. All of a sudden, we started to see that rise, but we were all experiencing this massive amount of growth across some of these startups and really rapidly growing companies. We're also moving more towards these product-led tactics, product-led growth. All of these things I feel like made this perfect storm for product operations to come in and start calming things down. 
(00:09:34):
I personally believe there's this natural evolution that happens at any mature function when it starts to grow in an industry and across an organization. So, think about marketing or sales. This just started to happen with product managers. For me, I was sitting there going, "Well, you can appoint a PM to liaise with other ops teams and the business, but at what risk?" Their product portfolio, the growth and adoption of their product, all these goals that they have to hit today in order to build a better tomorrow for their customers. So, I feel like that was the moment to say, "Okay, how do we give them the structure that they needed to thrive?" Because the CPO is in charge of so much more than product people have historically been in charge of, right? 
(00:10:17):
I'll probably talk about Marty Cagan several times here. I really do admire and respect him, and I think one of the things that he always talks about is future teams versus high performing teams and focusing on outcomes. CPOs went from deliver, deliver, deliver to really increased business metrics or just help drive the bottom line versus just really look at the product. You really have to figure out what that means for the product team at large. 
Lenny (00:10:45):
Got it. So, the way to think about this role, because I imagine most people haven't ever had a product ops person in their company is there's a slice of the PM role that companies are finding is valuable to put on a different person that has different skillsets that can take this endless load that PMs have. PMs have so many things to do and their job is so full of responsibilities that there's a sliver of stuff that a product ops person can take off. I'd be curious too and feel free to comment on that, but I'm also curious, you mentioned a few specific things that the product ops folks do. 
(00:11:19):
It'd be cool to just go through a bullet list of just those sorts of things, like you said, responsible for voice of the customer, pieces, alignment across stakeholders, whatever. If you could just go through some of those, that makes it really concrete I think for people to understand wow, this person that could have someone do all these for me, that'd be amazing. 
Christine Itwaru (00:11:37):
In some ways, I've got this question a lot from product managers who are concerned about the rise of this role or product leaders who are concerned that it was going to create some controversy or friction between product ops people and product managers. The way I've coached people to get around that is really, "What are your people responsible for? What are you holding them accountable to? Are you holding the product manager accountable to elevating these strategic insights so that they are going to elevate it to everyone else and then everyone else is going to go out there and build thing and drive the value or are you holding them accountable to truly understanding the customer in whatever way possible?" 
(00:12:15):
Especially going on and talking to the customer, please don't let anybody ever take that for granted. Really spending time with their engineers and the customers in order to drive a better experience. So, if they've got to spend all this time, which is our most valuable asset with those two entities, everything else still has to give. So, I think that yes, there was a point of friction, but I feel like now it's been a nice change where I'm seeing people in products saying, "No, I want to do product ops now," who was a former product manager. The second part of that, you said, let's go through the list of tactical things. Yes, voice of customer management is definitely one of the things that we're seeing more... 
(00:12:54):
I don't want to say mature because then I feel like I'm seeing mature of your peak, but the ones who have matured a bit, I feel like they are focusing more on the voice of customer elements. So, quantitative analysis, qualitative, bringing all of these different inputs that would traditionally be handled by product manager through looking across the aisle at their PM or looking at different data sources to the surface when they're going through their product development lifecycle planning, and really figuring out too what that balance is. I think there's an art. You can do voice of customer in two ways. 
(00:13:27):
You can do it one in this process way where you're feeding it to a really mature longstanding product team who has switchboard product or you have this voice of customer thing that you have to do for teams that are actually building something new. They're really trying to move fast, so how do you really get them what they need in order to experiment and iterate on the next thing that they're doing? That's one aspect. Another one is tooling. We see this more for folks who don't yet have tools under control in their product org. I'm not saying everybody has this, right? We had someone at one point handle whatever tools connected to Pendo and make sure that those systems are set up for maximum outcomes for the product manager. 
(00:14:10):
So, Pendo's connected to Salesforce. We're connected to Looker. We're connected to all these different. So, what does the product manager need to achieve out of all those things that ultimately drives our experience for Pendo ourselves? We get very meta here. That person was responsible for that. That's all also a part of the data component. The other things that we're seeing are more of along the lines of content strategy and being really intentional about making content and education a part of the product process and the delivery process. So, taking a look at how they maximize the outcomes from the outcome that the product manager is driving so that they can help increase retention, growth, and all of that good stuff for the product. 
(00:14:57):
So, those are some of the things that we're seeing. Then there's also this component that happens or this piece of it that happens in the beginning when you're standing a product ops for a product team that does not have much process in and that's the process piece. That's the bit that's a bit controversial, because folks are like, "Is this just program management? Is this just a different flavor of agile?" 
(00:15:20):
So, what we're seeing is this, what are these folks doing? Are they managing and facilitating the product development lifecycle? Are they doing things with the rest of the organization? So I feel like this one's a little bit up in the air. Some are actually agile facilitators as well, but I am seeing emergence of some companies that have the program management team under the product's umbrella to help with this massive amount of things that they have to manage across the board. 
Lenny (00:15:49):
Oh, that's a really interesting point on the last piece. I want to dig in on that a little bit just to summarize what you shared. So, some of the key roles of a product ops person, there's this voice of customer element and just to understand what you mean by that. The team is aggregating feedback from customers and feedback from the customer support and sales and things like that and sharing it with the product manager to give them clear conclusions and takeaways so that the PM doesn't have to sit there and filter their data. Is that a way to think about it? 
Christine Itwaru (00:16:19):
That's one part of it. We actually developed this really cool way of doing it here at Pendo, which is the transparency is a word that we love here. What we found that there was just not this need for the revenue org to be transparent and say, "Hey, this is what we're hearing. Product people, please listen," or vice versa. Here's what we're doing for your customer. There was this interesting moment where we realized that our sales team was screaming for something and our success team was screaming for something else, but [inaudible 00:16:46] looking at something else. So, they're all wonderful relevant things that our customers wanted, but we were like, "What if they're aware that they've got all these amazing things and they're talking about it separately?" 
(00:16:59):
Our PMs, they would get the whole readout with us, but we brought those folks in a room together. It was really cool because I think our head of professional services team at one point was like, "Whoa, this could truly impact what we do from an onboarding perspective and now we have this data. Then how do we then strengthen this area and the product?" So, it wasn't just about the components. So, I don't know if other companies are doing it like that, but I was very proud of the way we ended up doing that here. But the PM got risk data, high-priority deals, feedback from our feedback product. What are we hearing from prospects versus paying customers. What segments are saying what? 
(00:17:35):
All that stuff got fed over to the PM and then validated through our research team or disputed through our research team, which was really cool. This is a really good partnership with our research team. But on the other side, what was really nice too was we were able to educate our revenue team on behalf of the product team and say, "Guys, not everything requires a product change." So if you're saying there's customers that have friction around this one area of this product, maybe it's enabling. Maybe it's something that we need to help you guys understand a little bit better so that you can make their experience better or maybe we need to help update. It's just very simple things like that that just ended up coming up this voice of customer process. 
Lenny (00:18:15):
So essentially, it's just finding ways to make the PM more focused and allow them to focus on the things they want to focus on and reduce workload. On the user research piece, so it feels like there's user research coming in. PMs are involved, user research. There's a research team. Where does the product ops team fit in there or is it focused on internal alignment, stakeholder feedback more versus external customer feedback? 
Christine Itwaru (00:18:41):
Yeah. Again, I'll say these probably several times. Every company's doing it in their own little bit of flavor. I'll tell you that here and from a couple companies that I'm seeing outside of Pendo, our user research team sits with our UX team. They report into our head of UX and they are responsible for proactive research and making sure that we are aligning to our strategy and saying, "Okay, here's what our folks are saying. Here's why we're going after this market or this new thing that we're doing. Let's start going out there and validating or checking with some of these key personas and what we need to do." Then they are also a part of the ongoing development process or product development process. 
(00:19:21):
So, testing stuff out, making sure that they're doing user interviews, and all that good stuff. So, they sit as a partner to us. We work very closely together. Again, I'll give you that example of voice of customer, which is we have all of this input coming in from our customer success or post-sales teams and we know we're about to invest in our guides area of the product. We have all of these. What do we do with it? Well, we couple that with I'm personal responsible for NPS or I was for a very long time. I'm seeing a lot of noise around guides. 
(00:19:52):
So, I take all of that, we pull it all together, and we give it to our head of research and say, "All right. Let's all make sense of all this together. Is this something that is in line with the direction that the product team is going, the guides team, or is this something that we're going to need to dig a little bit more into to see if their efforts right now where they're growing are not where there should be going?" 
Lenny (00:20:10):
The other two bullet points, just to make sure I totally understand, you help with tooling. The product ops teams help, just optimize the tooling to build product. Is that a simple way to think about it, just make sure the product development process is efficient? 
Christine Itwaru (00:20:24):
Yeah, we partner with the program management team and the tools that they use for product development stuff. I would say it's more, "What are the things that the product manager needs in order to be successful?" So, we look at Pendo, right? We do use our own product like I mentioned quite a lot. Salesforce is another thing, so how does that all plug into our own product and what data are we looking to get out of there? So, our PMs have a complete picture in Pendo. Tray is another one I mentioned. Zapier was another one that we had used. So, it's more about the PM's tool stack versus the PM's planning tool stack if you want to draw that distinction. 
Lenny (00:20:59):
Got it. Okay. That is helpful. Then content strategy, by that, you mean internal documentation to train sales and customer support or is there also help the product team build out product marketing content and things like that? 
Christine Itwaru (00:21:13):
Neither or a bit. I guess what we have done is fed into both of those technical documentation. We use Zendesk as another tool, so we use Zendesk as another part of our tool stack to support our customers. So, a brand new feature comes out. Natural thing to do, let's write up this thing in Zendesk, but it's also about how we weave education into the product and we use Pendo again. Sorry, that's all right. It's actually really good tool. So, we do use Pendo guides and we just release our NPS themes. So, a pain in my team's butt has been manual labor around NPS themes and qualitative data. So, we designed this experience for customers who are in this beta. So, that they can in the product understand what it is. 
(00:21:59):
Then if they really need more, they can go out to the technical documentation, but it's about the education for the customer. I mentioned earlier treating content is a part of the development lifecycle process. You really want to treat it as a part of definition of done. When you think about product-led growth and the emergence of that in particular over the last couple years, it's all about creating that experience and keeps people in and helps them upgrade. So, they work alongside product marketing to develop these playbooks for what they're doing in app to create less friction and drive more engagement. 
Lenny (00:22:36):
Got it. Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Would it be safe to say that product ops is essentially for B2B companies where there's all these internal stakeholders, sales, customer support, marketing, things like that and that's the work that you can take off the product manager's plate? 
Christine Itwaru (00:22:53):
My personal experience and I think a lot of people would agree with me has led me to believe that's not accurate. It's emerged a lot more in B2B or I think we've seen it a lot more in B2B or at least people talking about it. I'm curious as to why and I wonder if it's because we're sharing because we're all trying to go through this thing together serving each other and then the other is serving the customer. So, it's not like, "Hey, you helped me figure this thing out." I understand I was so lucky and I still am so lucky to work with so many people in my network, in our customer base to help them understand the role or determine whether they even needed this thing or not. 
(00:23:28):
Without calling out names, there were some really big companies in retail and finance and some industries that you would not expect who are B2C, larger, well established companies who we all know and love and maybe not even love. Maybe the experience is bad for us. So, they also do have a lot more cross-functional engagement internally than we would even think of. So, I don't know if it's because we're used to this world and we haven't thought about that side of it, but it's really interesting. I think the common thread is the cross-functional transparency and then transparency out to the customer. 
(00:24:04):
So, I mentioned transparency is a big word for us, but readiness is another one and so readiness means a lot. You have your teams you need to get ready internally, but you really need to get customers ready for something new as well and everybody needs to feel aligned. So, it plays a massive part in what the product manager and the product team needs to consider, advocate for, deliver, and communicate about, I feel like no matter the size or industry. 
Lenny (00:24:28):
I imagine a lot of PMs listening to this have this two minded view right now of on the one hand, somebody could take all his work off my plate. That's awesome. On the other, it's like, "Oh, okay, there's another stakeholder that have loop into every meeting and they're going to be doing this work that's cool and important that I'm not going to get to do anymore." That's weird. What have you found is the best way to convince a PM to this is like, "Wow, this would make your life so much better"?
Christine Itwaru (00:24:54):
Yeah, I go back to that question that I have asked leaders when helping them stand this up, which is what are you looking at your PMs to drive and how are you measuring their success? That generally just helps everybody get on the same page really quickly. I've had customers or I've had folks come to me in the product community that say, "I've tried this and it's just not going anywhere." There's resistance to the role because they feel like it's stepping on too many toes and whatnot. Generally, I will tell you it's because they still have a bit of buying in the top to get done. 
(00:25:32):
I'm seeing that the most successful ones that are drawing the lines and showing that this role is valuable are the people that have their buy-in from their CEO or CPO at that level or their head of product and saying, "Hey, this is what this role means for you." So, I don't want to say it needs to be directive. I do want to say that you need to be able to articulate the value to somebody who's heading up essentially businesses and saying, "Here's what this role is going to drive for you at the end of the day." The very mature product ops end up having people that are strategic advisors too, a product leader. So, once you can show that this is what you'll also get as a result of me and this other person or me and this team doing this, it ends up being an easier conversation. 
Lenny (00:26:17):
What are a couple bullet points that are most effective to convince a product leader product op is going to make a big impact and benefit you and then just an ICPM who's like, "I don't want this person on my team"? What actually works there to get buy-in? 
Christine Itwaru (00:26:31):
Yeah. Number one, do you want your PMs to constantly be fielding questions from your revenue team when they could be spending time with customers? Yeah, you're shaking your head. That one seems to be the one. 
Lenny (00:26:43):
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good one. 
Christine Itwaru (00:26:44):
Yeah, I can count on one hand the companies who have blocked their product managers from speaking to customers and those companies are not product companies. I mean they do not believe in product management. They might say they do, but they don't. So, that's number one. Number two is how are you measuring your outcomes and where are you making this all transparent? Is this happening consistently across the board? So, one probably seeing product teams across so many different places is you might have somebody who's really passionate and really good at doing this stuff for their own vertical and then it doesn't scale. 
(00:27:20):
So, how are you doing this at scale so that your stakeholders are building this trust in you and making sure that they get the best out of the product team at any given turn? I say those are the two bullet points that seem to stick the most is that quality time, giving the PM what they need, which is their time to be able to drive the outcomes for the customer. 
Lenny (00:27:41):
What is it that you think a PM will never offload, if that makes sense? In your perspective, what's like the core of a PM's role versus maybe product ops for now and then maybe potentially other roles that take off some of the stuff on their plate? 
Christine Itwaru (00:27:57):
Speaking as a former PM, I would not ever give up spending time with customers and watching their pain. That sounds really bad to customers. I'm sorry. That's how I fell in love with product was I saw my internal customer 10, 12 years back now fighting with the keyboard, fighting with the mouse. I was just like, "Oh, my gosh. What's this guy doing?" 
(00:28:23):
I think it was an experience that some people might say, "Oh, I never want to be in that situation again because it made me feel very uncomfortable that my product is not doing for this person what it needs to," but for me, it was, "How do I make this thing do what it needs to for this gentleman? How do I make this thing better?" I cannot see product managers saying, "I don't want to be a part of that conversation." Then you know what? I'm going to say it then don't be in product. 
Lenny (00:28:50):
Love it. Yeah. I'm so curious what parts of the role get sliced off over time because I love that. That's the core of it is just build great products that your customers want and use and want to pay for. Then what else can people help you with along the side? Because yeah, PM role is just crazy. There's so many things going on.
Christine Itwaru (00:29:06):
It's crazy how this article that I wrote, I dug into the history of product management and it's like 100 years old not in its current form, but it's about 100 years old and just the evolution of what product managers have historically been responsible for. Then if you think about just really sit down and think about what the world has turned into today and how much noise we have coming at us. We talked about put yourself onto not disturb mode and I learned a long time ago, put myself onto disturb mode. So, imagine having a partner that helps you filter that noise. 
Lenny (00:29:44):
Yeah, quite useful. Along those lines, I was going to go in a different direction, but as you mentioned that, there's all these roles adjacent to PM. There's program managers, project managers, agile product owners, and all and then now product ops. I guess before team has product ops, let me just ask this one straightforward question. Which of those roles generally does the thing that product ops can do for you? Is it the PM or is it one of these other roles? 
Christine Itwaru (00:30:11):
It's a PM. It's PM. Yeah, it's a PM and then I would say, because what I'm seeing in less mature product orgs who first bring in product ops, the first thing they ask them to do is streamline the planning process. So, I would say it's a PM and maybe the agile. That's probably what it is today. I feel like program management and agile are starting to get a little bit close to each other in what they do. So, it's most of the PM stuff because we're doing elements of their job that they have off to the side versus being able to focus on. But again, in lesser mature orgs, the first thing is, "How do I actually just get the people to plan the same way and give me the thing that they're planning and doing?" 
Lenny (00:30:56):
That's interesting, what you said there, that maybe often a wedge to a product ops person joining their company maybe as a first product ops person is the planning, helping with the planning process. Is that what you find? 
Christine Itwaru (00:31:07):
It could be. The only thing that distinguishes product operations folks from program managers and agile is that product operations people know, understand the product, the customer, and the inner workings of the business. 
Lenny (00:31:20):
Cool. Yeah, Marty Cagan has some hot takes there about how product owners are never going to be great product managers. They don't really understand the customer needs and building product in any way. That's a whole other topic. I want to talk about the career path, but before we get there, I want to go in a spicy direction. So, Casey Winners, he is a guest on this podcast at one point. He wrote this hot take many years ago about this premise that operations in general often is a Band-Aid for inefficiency at a company. 
(00:31:54):
Companies often hire a bunch of ops people to just solve a problem and often they're much better ways to solve that problem. For example, tooling or a new process. His take is a person doing the thing often should be the last resort or it's a temporary gap and then over time you should strive to find a more efficient way to solve that problem than people. I don't think he's saying ops people in general or not necessary. It's an easy default. So, I'm curious what you think of that take. Generally, do you think product ops is this long term we're going to need more and more of this or is there a different path that's solving the problem that product ops? Spicy take warning.
Christine Itwaru (00:32:41):
Yes, I remember this. I'll address that inefficiency comment first, right? I mentioned a little bit earlier as roles in any industry or I guess any role matures like marketing or sales, this ops thing ends up being this natural progression. It's not just because the role itself is maturing. It's also because the org is maturing. So, what I found and what I'm finding with customers is that ops alignment across companies is what often ends up keeping the companies moving and keeping everybody aligned. So, to say ops teams are generally a sign of inefficiency or the need for them is a sign of inefficiency is not always accurate, it's generally a sign of growth and opportunity. 
(00:33:21):
People are really just trying to stay in aligned and do the best for the people that are doing the thing, the product managing, the marketing, the selling within that org. Overall though, I will say I will agree with his points about getting in and maybe giving it off and using humans for other things. I wrote something recently and I highlighted something that he mentions here in this article and what he mentioned on your podcast, which is we as product ops want to and should be standing up whatever processes or systems are needed and then get out of the way so we can focus on driving more strategic value. 
(00:33:58):
I keep mentioning that more mature product ops folks end up being a very good strategic advisor to leaders in product and to the product teams and that continues to be my belief. From day one, this has been my own personal goal for myself and for my team. I myself recently switched roles here at Pendo because I did what I said I was going to do, which was stand up the system, stand up the things that we knew we needed to do that were going to either be given off to another team or automated and then get the rest of the humans that are here to do the other strategic things for the product team.
(00:34:34):
Some of those are, "How do we increase retention? Like I mentioned, how do we focus on growth in this one area? How do we make the experience better in app? How do we do a better voice of customer management?" My energy now at Pendo is I'm able to now go towards more impactful things for not just the product team and the product community, but for our customers at large. So, I'm basically saying, "Look, I did what I needed to do and I'm ready to go." 
(00:34:56):
So I think that's something though that people need to be very, very comfortable with, very comfortable with. If you change course and change your tune two, three years into doing this and you built this team, you're like, "Here's what you're doing, manage this process," people are going to lose their mind. Change is constant, but telling someone, "I no longer need you to do that," it makes them a little bit nervous. So, for years when I was interviewing folks from my team, I made that one point abundantly clear to them, get into this role if you're comfortable letting go of things and moving on to something that is well worth your time. The company's going to change. 
(00:35:36):
Our process is going to need to be tweaked. The company is going to change. Something's going to need to be automated. We're going to need to cut something else. Maybe ChatGPT is going to make things very clear that humans are not always going to be doing the same things and we need to focus our energy elsewhere, but people do need to get comfortable with that role. 
Lenny (00:35:54):
I love that take. Generally, I think it aligns with what Casey's saying. What I'm hearing is you may be a product person today doing a bunch of stuff. Your job in a sense should be to automate as much of that as you can and find more strategic higher level things you could be doing instead of sitting there connecting Salesforce to Zendesk and maintaining that. It'd be great in customer feedback in theory. That could be a tool that could do that for you. That's part of the job. Is that roughly what you're saying? 
Christine Itwaru (00:35:54):
That's exactly what I'm saying. 
Lenny (00:36:24):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. 
(00:37:03):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing, companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:37:40):
Zooming out a little bit and building on the stuff we've been just talking about, what would you say are just signs that your company would benefit from a product ops team and that you're a fit for building a product ops team? 
Christine Itwaru (00:37:51):
I touched on this quite a bit, but that lack of transparency in many directions across, down. Sometimes people are on very transparent about, "Hey, this came up in planning and here's what we need to do." So it's relevant for stakeholder management, getting stuck out to customers, internal teams, and making sure they're aligned, revenue teams in particular. 
(00:38:11):
That was the first thing we focused on at Pendo was really aligning our success org and our sales org to the product team. We monitored success just within... I think a quarter was the time-bound space that we had it in on quality of inbound to the product team. So, that was really cool. It was just more thematic questions around tell us what you guys do because our customers would benefit from this versus teach me how to do this thing. 
Lenny (00:38:36):
I wanted to dig into the transparency piece. Is that the same point as the transparency piece or are those two different heuristics? 
Christine Itwaru (00:38:42):
That's transparency. Yeah, so what happened was we realized that we share this story actually quite openly and I'll share it here again, which is one of the things that kicked off products for us was we had a really bad launch, a really, really bad launch. It was a moment in company history where we realized that there was not transparency across the aisle and there was this lack of readiness across the organization and out to customers for what was coming. It wasn't this piece that folks say, "Oh, well, they didn't know this was coming." Well, there's two things. There's the knowing something's coming and then there's the knowing what to do with it. 
(00:39:18):
You can use just some status keeping thing to say, "This is coming in Q4 and as we get closer, here's the date," but it's what to do with it and how to position it and how to talk about it and all the things that was missing from it. It was really bad and it was my fifth week here. It was a moment of, "Well, I promised myself I'm going to let this happen." That was one of the things where I said, "I'm going to start to focus a little bit more on product ops within this director position I had just as director of product." Then I spun off and I think we need to do this thing and make it a bit more formal. 
Lenny (00:39:53):
Just to dig it on a story a little bit, so I didn't know this, so you were a product manager at Pendo. There was this bad launch and you recognize there's this gap that maybe I could fill, that somebody needs to fill and that you want to take that on. Can you talk a bit more about that? It's really interesting. 
Christine Itwaru (00:40:12):
Yeah. They brought me in as their first director level. So, I was doing a bit of director plus a little bit of IC stuff because we were starting to build up our product team. Yes, that launch happened and the product area was under development for about eight months from what I can remember. I came in with the assumption and also knowing fully well that I'm a brand new leader in this product team and product people want ownership. They crave autonomy, they crave trust, and all of that good stuff. I know that firsthand. I did not want to jump in and say, "Have you done X, Y, and Z?", especially in the first four weeks of me being there. Yeah, it did not go very well. 
(00:40:54):
So, we recognized that we had more opportunity that we should have grabbed onto to test more with customers, to find feedback loops that were going to be healthy for the team and for our customers, to stand up ways for us to measure changes and impact of changes that this thing was making to our customers. This was the biggest launch in our company history since the launch of the product. So, it was a moment where we all sat down very openly and shared with each other what we all could have done better. It wasn't just the product team. 
(00:41:25):
So, I truly believe with a really healthy product operations person or team, you have that ability to impact change across the company. So, yes, we look at that story. I remember us sitting there and being, "One day, we're going to look back at this story and we're going to say, 'Oh, yeah, I remember that.'" We do now four years later or four and a half years later, but yes, I felt really passionate about making sure that that didn't happen. 
Lenny (00:41:48):
The gaps you found are there's just like this lack of internal alignment. Sales didn't know what was going on. Customer support didn't know what was going on. That felt like that's where the gap was because that's what led to this product ops opportunity, right? 
Christine Itwaru (00:42:00):
Yes. There was a lack of alignment across again, they knew it was coming, they just didn't know the extent of what to expect and how to prepare customers or prospects or the change the way that we should have. There was definitely training. There was stuff being done. It just could have been a whole lot better. So, there were gaps there. One more point was the piece after that was I love people. I love managing people. I love healthy team environment and dynamics. 
(00:42:32):
As a product person, it means a lot to have that, because if you have direct reports, you obviously want them to be happy and healthy, but as a product person, you have this system around you even if you're not having people that report into you where you feel ownership to make sure these people are healthy. I remember even in my early days of being a PM, I wanted my engineers to be super happy. I wanted them to be proud of work that they were doing and I wanted them to be comfortable letting go of things that we no longer needed. 
(00:42:58):
I remember that moment looking around and looking at our engineers and seeing that they were like, "Hold on. What? Where do we go now? What do we do right now?" We wanted to take that moment and make it less about firefighting and more about being responsible and really customer obsessed. So, that was our moment or one of our moments for thinking about, "Okay, we might need product operations formalized here."
Lenny (00:43:24):
It's interesting that your mind went to product ops, because I think most companies would be like, "Oh, the product manager of this product screwed up. They didn't communicate enough to ensure sales. They didn't set up the marketing material well." It often falls on the product team and the product manager. What made you realize, "Oh, this is a product ops role and I need to move into that role versus here we are"? 
Christine Itwaru (00:43:46):
Yeah, I didn't say in that moment we need a product ops role. All I said in that moment was we need to create a system so that this doesn't happen again. That goes back to my definition of what product ops is. It's a thing and it is also a person or a group of people. It could be one or the other. So, I want to make sure we decouple that. It does not have to be humans. It can be that there's a system being created that is from a strong product person who knows how to get this team to be healthy. 
Lenny (00:44:12):
That's a really good way of thinking about it. That clarifies it in a big way. Thank you. You were talking about transparency and just like a sign that maybe you need product ops. I think the thing that stuck with me there is just the quality of questions the product team gets from sales, right? 
Christine Itwaru (00:44:27):
Yeah. I get a lot of questions around, "I'm investing in this. How do I measure the effectiveness of the team, all of these things?" It's really not easy to measure this in a quantitative measure just yet. Maybe one day, right? Actually, yes. Now one day, I feel like it might be coming sooner than we think. So, what we did was we looked at that transparency problem. We sent out this survey across both product managers and the sales and success teams and we said, "Where's your time going, PMs? How much time are you giving on average to the revenue team to firefight? How much time do you with customers that's quality time."
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]Then on the flip side to the revenue team, how many times do you find yourself asking questions? We gave all of these one to five and blah, blah, blah, those sorts of things, so that we can figure out where to place our energy. We came up with this, "Okay, well, it seems like there's a lack of transparency across the two groups. Let's start with getting data out or information out to the revenue team from the product org." We created this product digest. It's like today and it's matured quite a bit, but I go back to this whole people can know when they're coming, but they need to know what it is they need to do with it. So, this thing was less about this thing's coming next quarter, go tell your customers. 
(00:45:43):
It's more about here's how you get ready for it, here's how you get jazzed about, and then the handoff, which is probably the question you're going to have at some point, which is, "What's your line between PMM and products?" The handoff is that we don't teach them to sell. We don't teach them to position, but we know that the product intimately enough to help them understand the new value, to help them understand how to use the thing and to make sure that they're hitting the ground. 
Lenny (00:46:08):
Let's ask that question. If there's anything more, what is that line between product ops and product marketing? 
Christine Itwaru (00:46:13):
Yeah, I always say this and it and it's worked. I haven't seen anybody dispute it yet, but product marketing positions help the revenue team sell their lead gen for all of the outbound and the campaigns that they're running. They are marketing. They're helping you at the end of the day make this thing sound amazing and do the right things with it. For us, it's about educating and it's about helping our internal folks, our internal revenue team understand, "What is the added value? How do you now do this thing? How does this impact your role?" 
(00:46:48):
We focus a bit on the customer success persona, for example, on Pendo. Customer success managers can go in. They can see their account health and what's going on and blah, blah, blah. How does this impact you as a customer success rep and how do you then help your customers understand the value? Not hey, can you help us upsell this thing and here's how you do it. 
Lenny (00:47:06):
Great answer. Makes a lot of sense to me. Final topic, the career path of a product ops person. A lot of people listening to this podcast are either PMs today or I want to be PMs or thinking about becoming product manager, because PM can mean a lot of things. It's interesting, there's this new path that people can explore, product ops. I'm curious who you think might be a fit for the product ops role versus the product manager role. Someone deciding, "Oh, man, maybe I should go down this other route." What do you think are just signs that maybe you'd be a better fit where you enjoy that route better? 
Christine Itwaru (00:47:41):
Yeah, I love that question because it makes me feel that this role has become embraced a bit more. What I hear questions like in the past, it was, "Do we need this role and how do we help get the buy-in?" Now it's more the acceptance from a product manager to maybe want to even become this. I'm seeing more PMs, like I said, go into the space. So, it's no longer being seen so much as a threat. It's being seen as this partner. So, just one, I'll say that I think if you're someone like me who absolutely loves and I mentioned the story about the engineers and the team health and stuff, if you love creating that healthy team environment and one where there's cross-functional collaboration and it fuels you to empower the team more, it's a wonderful fit for you. 
(00:48:22):
Again, I was a PM for years and I felt that pain so much and how much we had to do in order to make this small change and then figure out whether it's valuable. I knew that there had to be a better way to get better outcomes to happen, but I also know that better outcomes don't just mean for the product. It means better outcomes for the entire product team, for the customer experience at large, and ultimately for the business. So, I think that that's one thing. If you're curious and you really want to learn more about that side of the house, one of the beautiful things I saw was one of my products managers fall more in love with understanding the business as she was starting to assure in her product ops career. I thought that was really cool. 
(00:49:04):
She had already had product background and she was like, "I want to understand the inner workings here so that I know how to help these people." So the other thing is if you're a PM having issues with the role that you're currently in, I think you need to remember that you are there to solve problems. That's a very simple thing that we talked about. What are the things that PMs won't shed and shouldn't shed and that go and talk to customers? We get to talk to customers in order to solve the problems, figure out the right problems to solve. You do that in product ops as well. You don't have to go out to customers externally, but my customers and the people I speak to are internally. They are helping me understand the pain that the product team is tied to. 
(00:49:47):
So, if you don't love solving problems through building brand new features and building a product, then how can you help contribute to solving other ones? If you're a true problem solver, think about whether you want to do that. So, if you know the pain, what can you do to build a better experience overall? You can ultimately impact your business. 
Lenny (00:50:03):
Do you find most product ops people, at least at this point, are former product managers? What would be the pie chart of last job was product manager versus not of existing product ops people? 
Christine Itwaru (00:50:13):
I got to put on a new survey. I do. I really have to put on a new survey. Initially, I saw a lot more folks moving in from management consulting, from customer success, from technical success. I haven't seen anyone from sales move in yet, and I have seen a couple PMs. Now, that's the day-to-day product ops manager. I will tell you that the people who are standing up the product ops orgs and being the first product ops hire at the leadership level are former product people. 
(00:50:45):
I strongly advocate for product ops leaders to have done that role, to have actually had hands-on product experience building and understanding customer problems and feeling that pain, because you very quickly realize where to place your efforts and where your team's efforts should go. That helps you from an efficiency perspective and the business knows you're not just dilly-dallying. 
Lenny (00:51:11):
That's really interesting. That makes a lot of sense. Just the roles you named again, where product op people come from. You said customer success. What are the others again?
Christine Itwaru (00:51:19):
I have seen technical success. I've seen management consulting. The management consulting piece makes a ton of sense to me. I think there's that data piece that they really like to lean into and advisory, and then the leadership ones coming in from product to leader roles. That's been a happy change too, seeing a director say, "I now want to move into a position to coach the teams and to help build a stronger product team overall. I don't feel like building product." 
Lenny (00:51:46):
Fascinating. For someone that's like, "Wow, I want to do this job. This sounds rad," what advice would you give for people to pursue this role and get a gig in product ops? 
Christine Itwaru (00:51:58):
Well, one, it's a good thing that there's no shortage of these roles. I would say that there are a lot of these roles open out in the industry. Be intentional about what you want to do, because right now, it's still in a bit of, "Well, what are we doing in product operations as a product management community?" There's no consistency industry to industry, size to size, team to team. It is very different. So, really think about your strengths. Do you love data? Are you a person who thrives on being able to make beauty out of this mess that you're seeing and advise people and help them understand maybe this is a direction that we should be going in? 
(00:52:40):
Are you technical where you're like, "No, I actually really enjoy doing the quantitative side of things," and you truly enjoy working with data science teams and you really like to bring that data aspect to the product teams? You could probably find a mix of both. There are people who do like doing both of those things. Generally, I mentioned this and I keep saying it, standing up that system because you know that if you had it, you would've been a better PM. 
(00:53:05):
I think that that's a big thing there. If people realize that there's a better way to do it and they no longer have to do it all but they can do a slice of it in order to drive efficiency for the organization, then start thinking about going out there and doing it. The other thing too is look at those roles and make sure that you fine-tooth comb those job descriptions. Some of them are very vague because they're trying to figure it out on their own as well. So, the more you know what you want to do as a product person, the more you know what to lead out from these roles. 
Lenny (00:53:36):
Are there red flags when you're looking at a product job description of, "Hmm, this isn't really the role you want"? 
Christine Itwaru (00:53:43):
I think this is a red flag for any role. I mentioned that it's really hard right now to put a number to the success of the role or on the success of the role, but if there's no, "This is how you will be measured or this is what we're looking at as a successful outcome for this person in this role," I would say that's probably a red flag. That's table stakes people need to have on their job descriptions. 
Lenny (00:54:06):
Final question. Something I try to get to with people from new companies that I haven't talked to before is just to get a general sense of how the product org is structured at the company. Just because people are always curious, how do you structure product teams? So I guess broadly I'd love to hear just how is the Pendo team product team structured? What are the buckets? Then also, is their product ops person integrated into each cross-functional product team? 
Christine Itwaru (00:54:31):
Yeah, I too love to learn about this. We're broken into major areas of the business or revenue streams and we have general managers over those. The GMs actually sit in the product team, which is nice. All have PM background, all really, really experienced and incredible. We also have a head of growth, so there's that component to it as well. Then you've generally got the senior directors. There are teams of product managers who are responsible for different areas in the product. So, we've got one product that's our core product and very mature, broken down into different components there. We have a newer product where that's just one straight product team versus having many different directors. 
(00:55:06):
We do have a product ops person integrated into these teams. I'd say probably all of them at this point, but the key thing here is they share themselves across two or three teams. Something going through listeners' minds right now is, "Christine, is there a ratio of product ops people to the team?" I would say that at one point, I felt like there might have been and I don't think that's the case anymore. Again, based on my experience and what I'm learning, we operate pretty lean and a lot of people are having to operate very lean right now. So, every few quarters, we look at our goals. We determine who or what goals need a product ops person and for what reason. We're really intentional about it. 
(00:55:44):
As an example, I use this saying respect the hustle with my team a little bit for the newer product that's still finding its way. The last thing you want to do as a product, which for somebody who I had a legacy product in my last job, one that I was building from the ground up and one that I was just responsible for getting out the door, sun setting at some point, you don't want anyone stifling creativity with any process or some time bound this or anything like that. So, the last thing you want to do is introduce something in there that feels like that you want them to hit the ground running. 
(00:56:18):
So, we don't over-index on things like a certain planning process or you need to get this to us because the other teams have. We need to know this thing by this timeframe. We'll do what we need to do from there. That's it. We're also quicker with the data. Voice of customer stuff takes a little bit longer for a more mature product team or this is more like, "What are we learning right now and how quickly can we communicate this over to that team so they can iterate really quickly?"
Lenny (00:56:47):
Awesome. To come back to the structure just briefly, so you have GMs, business units. Within the business units, you have directors of product that report up to the GM within each and the directors or product have cross-functional product team that they operate that builds specific features and elements of the larger product. Then there's a product ops person supporting some of these teams and they're shared across teams. Got it. 
Christine Itwaru (00:57:14):
You've got everybody rolls up to a CPO. CPO's got all of this. 
Lenny (00:57:15):
Christine, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. I'm going to just fire them away. Does that sound good? 
Christine Itwaru (00:57:23):
Yes, let's do it. 
Lenny (00:57:24):
Let's do it. Two or three books that you recommend most to other people.
Christine Itwaru (00:57:28):
Classic is Inspired by Marty Cagan. It's one of the reasons I really fell in love with the product. It's inspirational. Leaders Eat Last, Simon Sinek. I really like that book too. That's more leadership style and making sure you putting in your team first, which is something I strongly believe in. This is a plug, but I also really like the book and it's very practical so it falls in that category, which is the Product-Led Organization by our CEO Todd Olsen. Really good book for right now, especially with people really going through this transformation. 
(00:58:00):
There's an old book that I have that's sitting on that shelf. It's Product Roadmaps Relaunched. It is really old. I mean I don't want to date myself, but it's almost 20 years old when I was in college. But it's really, really valuable and I can reference it just for a quick yeah, I forgot about that from a communication perspective for a roadmap. This is really cool. 
Lenny (00:58:21):
Favorite other podcast?
Christine Itwaru (00:58:22):
The Product Experience Podcast from Mind the Product. I really like that one. A little bit similar to this other favorite one I'm on right now, but lots of really good product people and just very practical advice too. For leadership, I like HBR IdeaCast. Again, I like to balance the business side and the people side of leaderships.
Lenny (00:58:44):
Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Christine Itwaru (00:58:46):
Because I have kids, my brain is flooded generally with kid shows. I would say this year, it was between the new Matilda movie, which is based on the Broadway production, which was based on the old Matilda movie, but it's really, really good. Really well done. Then there's this movie. I think it's called Rise. Have you seen it? It's about the Giannis... I cannot say, forgive me, his last name, but he's on the Milwaukee Bucks, basketball player. It's about overcoming adversity and just struggle and really pushing through and giving it your all. I think that one is really good. Add it to your list if you haven't. It's called RISE. TV, I have Food. I don't have a favorite TV show. I've just finished watching White Lotus if that's qualified. 
Lenny (00:59:33):
It's the most popular mentioned TV show on this podcast. 
Christine Itwaru (00:59:40):
Yeah, I would say for TV in general, you give me anything food. I love cooking. I'll cook an entire massive meal, three course, whatever, sit down, and eat it while I'm watching. Yeah. 
Lenny (00:59:53):
Yum. Favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people? 
Christine Itwaru (00:59:58):
If you could choose any career outside of what you're doing, what would it be and why? 
Lenny (01:00:04):
What do you look for in an answer there that tells you that this is a strong candidate versus not? 
Christine Itwaru (01:00:08):
There are skills that are a part of that other role that I would lean into. So, if somebody were to ask me that question, I would tell you a chef. It's about experience and it's about constantly refining your craft and it's about constantly looking to delight. I think that speaks to my love for product. It's all about that end state for the customer. So, I always ask that question and I look to see, "What is it? Are they looking for fame? Are they looking for the temporary role?" It's really telling. You dig into the qualities of what makes a good candidate for the other thing. You can figure out a lot. 
Lenny (01:00:47):
Fascinating. If they're watching this and learning the secret, that's a good sign too. They're doing the research. 
Christine Itwaru (01:00:52):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:00:53):
Top five SaaS products that you love, use at work other than Pendo. 
Christine Itwaru (01:00:53):
I got to say Pendo.
Lenny (01:00:59):
We already know. We already know that's on the list. 
Christine Itwaru (01:01:01):
Yeah, I love Miro. I love Miro so much. During the pandemic, this became an essential tool for so many teams. I brought it into our company and I was a big advocate, part of my last one as well, just the collaboration and connection. Figma along the same lines, I think Figma is really great at that for our design team and the rest of products. So, that one's been really good. Seismic is one that I really like as well. That's the content management system for our go-to-market teams. So, it really plays well into how do we make sure we give them what they need and the tool that they need to be in. 
(01:01:36):
Gong is another one. I think Gong's really great. I've watched them go from the early days and I think we were an early customer or we were using it early on. I think they've pivoted at some point or they've definitely updated messaging on the coaching for their teams and us being able to dig into the qualitative insights that we get on those calls of people is really good too. So, yeah.
Lenny (01:02:01):
Great list. Ones that people haven't mentioned before, so that's always fun. Final question, what's something relatively minor that you've changed in Pendo's product development process that has had a tremendous impact on the way that you build product? 
Christine Itwaru (01:02:15):
This one's going to sound really elementary or for some people really elementary, but for some people, they're going to be like, "Uh-huh, I totally feel that." Early on, we started bringing in engineers to customer meetings more and more and you don't want to typecast or profile an engineer, but generally, they're not raising their hand and being like, "Yeah, I'm going to come and join, blah, blah, blah." They want to make sure they're doing their job and building the experience, but it's so simple and it's so effective. When we started doing it, the response from the engineering team was great and then also it helped us dig into a different side of the customer while we were on call sometimes. Some of them were flies on the walls. 
(01:02:52):
Some of them were actually engaging with the engineers and help them increase their confidence in speaking to customers. So, I don't know. I feel like that just ended up changing a lot of the way that we started planning and making sure that their voice had a certain amount of weight or even more weight than it did before in the product development lifecycle. We respect their time. I remember some were very nervous and be like, "Oh, I got to do all this other stuff," but they're like, "Okay, I'll try it." 
(01:03:21):
Then all of a sudden, they're like, "Whoa, I really want to do this more and more." But it's just really being able to see that pain for them firsthand from a customer or the delight and frustration was very impactful. So, that's my answer and I feel like if you're not doing that as a product manager or product leader, then you better get on that train real fast because it's life changing for the entire team. 
Lenny (01:03:42):
That is an awesome answer. This is the first time I've asked this question. I think I'm going to make it a standard question now because I feel like we're going to get all kinds of cool nuggets. So, thank you for starting it off with a bang. Christine, thank you so much for joining me. I learned more about product ops in an hour than I've learned in years and years of reading about it online. 
Christine Itwaru (01:04:02):
Thank you. 
Lenny (01:04:02):
So, thanks for making the time. Thanks for sharing all your wisdom. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe ask you some questions about product ops and then how can listeners be useful to you? 
Christine Itwaru (01:04:13):
They can connect with me on LinkedIn. You'll put that up, I'm sure. Twitter, same. I've got my own site, so the productcraft.com. I started posting on product management products. I'm going to start doing some stuff on careers, all that good stuff. How can they be useful? So don't laugh at me, people. I needed a Twitter reset and so I had that for 13 years and then I no longer did and now I took it. So, just help me rebuild over there and just get back on that site. That's more immediate, but I would say help me understand what's going on in product and product ops. I will continue to do things like this and share more about what I'm learning, but I need to learn more from other people as well. That's an amazing, incredible part of my job that I'm about to do. 
(01:05:00):
There's just like a lot of pain right now all around us in the tech industry. I think about today and probably the next year or so. For people who are really questioning their next steps in their product careers, whether they stay in it, whether they move into something adjacent or relevant, they're looking to sharpen their skills, maybe make a site pivot to ops, whatever it is. I'm really interested to just gather more data on this and see how it all plays out while also trying to see if I can make some connections. So, I've been able to do that. Full circle back to Ben, Ben did this for me and you. I think that it's really important that the product community is smaller than we think. It's large and it feels expansive, but it's smaller than we think. 
(01:05:43):
I think we're all facing an interesting time where people may be, again, questioning that next move or struggling. It would just be amazing for us to share. So, cheesy as it may sound, product ops for me was an easy way to be able to connect the dot and be that partner, right? Talk about the transparency and alignment. If there's a way that this community can help empower me to do more of that for all of you, I think that that would be incredibly helpful. 
Lenny (01:06:06):
What a beautiful way to end it. Christine, thank you again for being here. 
Christine Itwaru (01:06:10):
Thank you. This was so fun.

## Transcript

Christopher Lochhead (00:00:00):
The point being, now is the greatest time in history to be a creator, to be an entrepreneur, to be a marketer. I've been a marketer for my entire adult life. It's never been greater than it is right now. And so here's the big thing that I would share. If you are somebody for whom you want to make an exponential difference, you want to innovate, you want to create new value where there wasn't, you want to have a legendary career where you could look back on your career and go, you know what? I was part of this and that, and I was on this team, now's the greatest time in history. And what I would say to you is, the future needs you.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

He's also an advisor to over 50 venture-backed startups, and a former three-time public company CMO.

(00:01:07):
In our conversation, we dig deep into all things category design, including what exactly is category design? Why, in order to build a legendary business, it's so essential to build your own category versus trying to become the best in an existing category. Also, how to actually go about creating your own category. A ton of examples of companies that did this well and didn't do this well, what we could learn from them. Plus a ton of practical frameworks, including something Chris calls The "Better" Trap. Also, why he thinks product market fit is a very dangerous idea. Chris is such a character and I had such a blast speaking with Chris. With that, I bring you Christopher Lochhead after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:37):
Christopher, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Christopher Lochhead (00:03:41):
Lenny, it is my absolute joy. And let me say in case my ADHD brain forgets, I love all things Lenny. You're doing a great job, buddy. I'm honored to be here. And there's so many people in the entrepreneur startup marketing world who are scam artists, shysters, pieces of shit, idiotic hustle porn stars yelling stupidities. There's a lot of idiocy in the world in which you travel and I travel, and you, sir, stand out. You are making a difference. The conversations you're driving, the content you're creating. You're fucking awesome, Lenny, and I'm really stoked to be here with you.

Lenny (00:04:27):
Damn, what an intro to my own podcast. I'm bad at accepting compliments. I'm just going to accept that and I appreciate that, man.

Christopher Lochhead (00:04:34):
No, you need to get it. You are a beacon in an ocean of crapola. You are incredible.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Well, enough about me. I really appreciate it. I was preparing for our conversation and usually what I try to do when I prepare for conversations is I read everything the person has written and it was very challenging with you. You have two podcasts, you have at least six books. There's probably more I missed. You have a newsletter, you tweet a lot. There's probably a lot of other stuff I didn't get to. And so you made my job very difficult preparing for this podcast, but also very worthwhile. So I'm excited to begin.

Christopher Lochhead (00:05:07):
I apologize for that.

Lenny (00:05:09):
The other thing I noticed as I was browsing your website, and it was hilarious because you have all these testimonials of your book and podcast and you have a lot of negative reviews, like "Off-putting, or, "Very disappointing," or, "Absolute crap." I'm curious why you chose to do that as your website testimonial wall.

Christopher Lochhead (00:05:29):
Well, and I believe, I'd have to check with Steve Osler, the founder and publisher of Podcast Magazine, but I believe I'm the only podcaster in history to run a full page ad in Podcast Magazine with just negative quotes in it.

(00:05:44):
So a couple reasons. Number one, can we all just have a sense of humor about this stuff? So it's my way, and the name of our team, yet we're sort of a company, but we're more of a band, is Category Pirates. I mean, clearly if you're called Category Pirates, you're probably trying to have a little bit of fun with this stuff. And so part of it is just trying to have a sense of humor with people.

(00:06:10):
The second piece of it is, for a lot of entrepreneurs, marketers, creators, innovators of any kind, we live in this fear that when we launch our thing, whatever our thing is, that we will be criticized by the world and that we will be made fun of. And if you've ever authored a book or done a podcast or done anything, built a product, a software product, built any kind of a product that you feel is part of you, and most innovators, creators, software developers, artists, of course entrepreneurs, feel that way because they put themselves into this stuff. And when somebody criticizes us, many of us are devastated. And I have been in the past too. I'm a person just like anybody else.

(00:06:55):
And what I realized is, fuck them. Anybody who's trying to do anything exponential, anybody who's trying to break and take new ground, anybody who's trying to radically innovate, anybody who's trying to design and dominate new categories of the way we live, work and play, gets criticized. Picasso was called stupid. The Beatles were called terrible. Elvis was called terrible. I just wrote recently a little bit about hip-hop. I was listening to Rick Rubin on Barry Weiss's podcast, excellent episode. Excellent. She does a great job with him. And he was talking about how ridiculed hip-hop was in the beginning and it got banned. And it's the number one category of music in America today.

(00:07:38):
Anyway, so that's also part of it, is to just sort of say, "Hey, look, this is some of the shit people have said about our work and my work, and I'm going to just put it on display, because this is going to happen to all of us."

(00:07:50):
And then I guess, Lenny, the third reason is in the creator world, broadly, there's a lot of people who are breaking their arms patting themselves on the back. And look, I understand why we have to tell people about why they should pay attention to us, and so we use our credentials or our awards or our downloads or our books, I understand that, and I do a little bit of that too. However, come on, let's just not take ourselves so seriously.

Lenny (00:08:17):
Amazing. I could definitely use more of that skill of not taking negative feedback as seriously. And I love the idea of just embracing it and showing people what people don't like.

Christopher Lochhead (00:08:27):
Why not? I mean, look, you're incredibly successful and if somebody says something negative about you, okay, great. Fuck them. They're not your people.

Lenny (00:08:39):
Fuck them. There we go.

Christopher Lochhead (00:08:40):
I didn't know who you were until Substack, and I saw your logo, the fiery logo, and there was something endearing about your logo. And the other thing that's great about you, from a radical differentiation marketing perspective is, you call yourself Lenny. And when I talk about you, I don't know your fucking last name. I mean, I sort of know it, but I don't really, you know what I mean?

Lenny (00:09:04):
Yeah. It's hard to pronounce.

Christopher Lochhead (00:09:04):
Actually, I was at the gym this morning and I was telling my buddy that we were doing this, and I said, "Oh, I'm going on Lenny's Podcast." He says, "Lenny who?" And I said, "It begins with an R. I don't know. Everybody just calls him Lenny." And so the fact that you are yourself, you don't play a character, you're not a douche, you're just a person trying to be successful in the world and help others, right?

(00:09:28):
That's a very powerful thing. And I think one of the things that is insidious about influencers, hustle porn stars, part of the business model is creating the perception of superiority, right? The reason Grant Cardone and Tai Lopez and all these douchebags pose in front of planes and all this garbage is they want you, the Kardashians are the queens of this, they want you to look at them and go, "Oh, wow, don't I wish that I was them."

(00:10:03):
And so these folks are in the create and monetize envy business, and you're the opposite of that. And I think the legendary educators in the native digital world are the opposite of that. Anybody who's creating separation, anybody who's putting themselves above, anybody for whom there must be, "I must be the leader, and you must be the follower," that's the business model of a massive amount of people in the native digital world, and we reject that. And I know you do.

Lenny (00:10:34):
Absolutely. We've already gotten way off track, but I love it. I'll just say one thing and then we'll get back on track. The reason I called my newsletter, Lenny's Newsletter is because that was the default recommendation Substack gave me when I signed up. They're just like, "Call it this." And I'm like, "Okay," because I don't know, I didn't have no plans to actually be doing this long term. And then it just stuck. And then I brainstormed for weeks. I'm like, "I need a real name on this thing." And I just couldn't think of anything that I liked. So I'm just like, "All right, I'll just roll with it." And then when the podcast launched, I tried so many ways to call it something else so that it would push the whole naming in a different direction, it wasn't about me, but I couldn't think of anything better. So I'm just rolling with it at this point.

Christopher Lochhead (00:11:12):
Well, and the interesting thing is, even though the branding of the shit has your name in, it's not about you. That's the irony, right? Meghan Markle gets canceled. Why? Because it's about her, and it turns out she's infinitely uninteresting. I've consumed enough of your content to know that the cool thing is, yeah, it's called Lenny, but it's actually, you are not trying to impress all of us with how awesome you are in front of a fucking plane or a bunch of scantily clad people, or I don't know what.

Lenny (00:11:54):
It's true. Well, I'm enjoying this podcast. You're very kind to me. Let's talk about the meat of what I want to chat about, which is your bread and butter category creation. It goes without saying you're a big fan of creating your own category versus what most people try to do, which is try to compete in an existing category. So just to kind of lay a little foundation, can you just explain what this actually means, this idea of category creation for people that have heard this idea in this term, but don't really know what it means.

Christopher Lochhead (00:12:23):
It turns out that in business, most people, and in life for that matter, make a unquestioned, unconsidered, undialogued, unthought of decision that they don't know they made. And the decision they make is, "What I'm going to do, is I am going to compete in a market with demand, with a better product/service/brand, maybe a better business model, maybe a better set of growth hacking ideas that I learned on the Lenny Podcast. And when the world gets my better, the world will beat a path to my door."

(00:13:16):
And if you go onto Amazon right now, Lenny, there's roughly a hundred thousand marketing books, and I think I'd have to double check, but I think there's about 60,000 or 80,000 business strategy books. And of course, me and my collaborators, we haven't read all of them, but like you and like many of us in business, we've read many of the tomes, the Bibles out there, and there's an interesting thing about virtually all of them. That's what they're about. It's about how to compete and win.

(00:13:53):
Well, here's the aha. Nobody legendary ever did that. Not a one. We all know who Bob Marley is. We don't know who the 17th greatest reggae musician or band in the world is. We all know who Pablo Picasso is. We don't know who the fifth greatest cubist artist is. And so wherever you look in life, whether it's in the business world, people who drive social change, artists, creators of any kind, the people that we tend to admire the most are the people who broke and took new ground. And the aha here is the category makes the product, the category makes the brand, the category makes the company.

(00:14:51):
So I'll give you the data and then I'll fully answer your question. So here's the data. We did an analysis for our first book where we studied every venture-backed tech company in the US from 2000 to 2015. And we asked a question that, to the best of our knowledge, had never been asked before. And we went to Stanford and we asked a bunch of professors this question, and they said, "We don't know this. You're going to have to do it yourselves." So we did, and incidentally had it peer reviewed and published in the HBR. And if you've ever gotten data published in the HBR, then you know what it's like to have a journalistic proctology exam.

(00:15:32):
Anyway, here's the net of it. In tech market categories, on average, one company earns two-thirds, 76% to be exact, of the total value created as measured by market cap and or valuation. So not market share, which is important, market cap as measured by the value of all the companies in the category. So you take a category, you add all the companys' value together, and you say, "What percent goes to the leader, the category, queen or king? And what percent goes to everybody else?" One company, two-thirds of the economics.

(00:16:12):
So the aha here, Lenny, is when we make the unquestioned, unconsidered, undialogued decision that we didn't know that we made, to compete, we have unwittingly said, "We're going to fight for the 24%." And it's the distinction or delta between create demand and capture demand. So we prefer the term category design, and I can explain why design instead of creation, we don't have anything against creation, but creation creates a confusion in people's mind. When people hear category creation, because most people in business, most people in tech, are strongly oriented to product, what they think you said is first to ship a product that has X features.

(00:17:08):
So when most people say category creation, that's what they think. They say, "They [inaudible 00:17:16] category, Myspace did." Or if you've been around for a little while longer, "GeoCities did." And so category creation, category design, does not equal first to ship a product with a set of features. So what does it equal? Here's the aha. Just like you can design a product, just like you can design a company culture or business model, you can actually design a market.

(00:17:46):
And in so doing, you create a new distinction in value for people that didn't exist before. I'll give you a simple example. If I could own any product in the world right now, I think I'd probably want to own Purell. And there's a great thing about the company that makes Purell. The company's been around for a very, very long time, and they're owned by the original family that created the company. Their original problem that they were solving is, it was a husband and wife team, and they were working in a factory. This was 80 plus years ago. The company, by the way, is called Gojo Industries. Gojo. And Gojo is a portmanteau, putting their two names together. I think it was, maybe it was Gloria and Joseph, or I'd have to double check the husband and wife names, you'll excuse me, but the company's called Gojo Industries, and I think the granddaughter runs it today, if I'm not mistaken.

(00:18:54):
Anyway, so the gal, the wife said, "This bar soap is disgusting. It's full of crapola, it's hairy, it's full of man nastiness." So the solution to washing your hands called a bar of soap was a disgusting, inappropriate solution for her. So she reimagined the problem, not as, "How do I wash my hands," but as, "How do I wash my hands without a disgusting bar soap?" And Gojo Industries created a whole new category called liquid soap. And in most restaurants, most corporate bathrooms, most airport bathrooms, if you start paying attention, you'll see the Gojo logo on the squeezy thing that you pull when you go to get the soap. So unlike most innovators and entrepreneurs, who get obsessed with the solution, and I understand why, we all love our shit, we all love our product. If you want to talk to me about our shit, I want to talk all about it.

(00:20:05):
We could do a 12-hour deep dive on all your content and how you built the newsletter, and you'd love it. It'd be great. We all do. If you're a creator of any kind, entrepreneur, innovator of any kind, you love the thing you're creating, of course. However, Gojo focused on the problem, not just the solution. So they stay obsessed with the problem, and then they ask a different question, which is, "How do I wash my hands in the absence of water?" And of course, the answer to that question is a new category, [inaudible 00:20:44] hand sanitizer. And the dominant brand, of course is Purell.

(00:20:49):
And so the aha here is the company that designs the space and gets it to tip at scale. And when I say designs the space, what I mean is specifically gets a meaningful percentage of the world to agree with their definition of a problem set, which then leads to their definition of a solution set. The company that does that at any kind of scale, wins. And so the number one question for any entrepreneur or any creator at all is, "Do I want to compete for 24% of an existing market category? Or do I want to create my own where if I can execute, I will earn two-thirds of the economics?" That's the decision that most entrepreneurs make, that they don't know that they made. And at its heart, category design is about the most radical kind of differentiation.

(00:21:52):
So most companies actively seek comparison. If you go to, well, if go to many software company's website right now on their homepage, you'll see a Gartner report or a Forrester report on their homepage. You'll see ads and/or content that say, "Here are three competitors and a list of features," and there'll be 25 features, "And then there's us," and there'll be 125 features. And they're actively inviting comparison. You even hear it in ads. If you listen to what marketers say, Lenny, we say the stupidest shit. Don't take our word for it. Anyway. And so the legendary innovators over time, they did not compare their innovation to the past. They broke and took new ground. They wanted to be irreplaceable. They wanted to be so much value in the minds of customers that not only were the switching costs horrible, switch to what?

Lenny (00:23:07):
To follow this thread a little bit, companies that you're pretty familiar with, maybe just a rapid fire sharing of their category to give people a concrete sense of what does it even mean to have a category?

Christopher Lochhead (00:23:21):
Okay, let's go.

Lenny (00:23:22):
It's becoming obvious that they basically all came up with a different category that they wanted to win. And so Gong comes up as an example. I don't know if you know about Gong. I think they-

Christopher Lochhead (00:23:32):
I do.

Lenny (00:23:33):
So it's basically like sales analytics is what they pitch, is like, this is the first thing you can ever do to understand how your sales team is doing. Is there anything you know more about their approach?

Christopher Lochhead (00:23:43):
Yeah, I know the space very, very well, and they did something incredibly smart. So they were a little later in the space than some others. And so there were a whole bunch of companies in today which you could broadly refer to as the revenue space, right? In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm familiar with Clary. I'm good friends with Andy. I know the team. I've done some work with them. So all disclosure. Clary, and a handful of others, in the beginning started to create the space that ultimately became RevOps. And the interesting thing that Gong did, very smart, was as RevOps started to emerge, they were smart enough to realize that revenue was going to be a big new important space. That CRM didn't actually do it. That ERP didn't actually do it. BI didn't actually do it. And so there was this sort of emerging set of thinking around, "We need a different approach to revenue."

(00:24:44):
They were smart enough to realize that if they went for the whole enchilada, it's not credible from a startup that you're going to go build, that you're going to show up and say, "We have a suite that's equivalent to that of SAP, just for this other area." So they picked off a very tight part of a broader emerging category, and they executed incredibly, and they dominated that part. But here's the mistake they made. In all new mega categories, they start like this. This is exactly what happened in CRM. I could walk you through the history if it matters, but there were companies in support, there were companies in help desk, there were companies in sales, there were companies in marketing, and there were a whole bunch of sub-niches underneath that. There was a point in time in the Salesforce automation category, when that was a standalone category, that some of the hottest companies in that category were sales configurator companies, a further down niche.

(00:25:44):
And so as these mega spaces emerge over time, no one company can fulfill the needs of a customer. And so there's all these niches. The mistake that Gong made, as well as the vast majority of others in that space, is they stayed in their micro niche. So the strategy in the beginning that was genius and exactly what you should do as a startup, all of a sudden, when they didn't expand and set the agenda, the design for the big category, they got fucked. Because now they're niched. And there's a big learning in this Lenny, which is, if you're a company that's already up and running and you're winning, and let's say you're becoming the category queen in your space, every entrepreneur, every CEO, faces a fascinating moment. If they become successful in the first five years or so, which is they realize their biggest barrier to growth going forward, is their current category, because you can only be as big and successful as your market category.

(00:27:02):
And so you have to continuously expand the vision for the category and continuously build on that. And if you don't, and somebody else frames, claims, and names, the bigger agenda, as has been the case, and look, I'm biased, as has been the case with Clary, Clary's crushing everybody in this space right now, and the Gongs and all the other players are now in this horrible position, which is they basically only have two choices. One, they can stay in their niche, which is what most players do, and they argue best of breed "Oh, well, we're the best revenue carbodingulator. And you could go buy an end-to-end revenue platform. But if you do that, you won't get the best functionality in the carbodingulator space. So buy our revenue carbodingulator." That doesn't work. Microsoft proved it over 30 years ago, and we can talk about that if you want.

Christopher Lochhead (00:28:00):
Microsoft proved it over 30 years ago, and we can talk about that if you want. You either stay in your niche and get diminished over time, or you uplevel and you go to play for the whole enchilada. The problem is for them and all the others in this space who didn't do that, if they were to do it today, well over a year after Clari did, they're just a Clari copycat. And so basically you either go compete with Clari for who can be the category king, or you stay in your niche and get diminished over time. And if you're going to go compete with the company that is laying down the category design that's picking up the most momentum for the overall market, you better know how to do a fifth dan black belt category wars.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Following that thread, there's a bunch of threads I'd love to follow, but something I definitely wanted to touch on is, in this concept of the better trap, which is where most people go, where they try to be the better solution in an existing category. And just to reinforce that point, what have you seen? What have you learned about just why that is often, and maybe always the wrong approach?

Christopher Lochhead (00:29:19):
Let's take a very current example, Threads. We just wrote about this. When Threads came out, and I can show you all the headlines if you want to see them, New York Times, nevermind tech... All these places. Twitter killer, Twitter killer, Twitter killer, Twitter killer. And at the time there's all this discussion of Musk and Zuck having a UFC cage fight. And so there's all this buildup into the launch of Threads and there's all this supposed Twitter hate, and, quote, unquote, "Everybody's leaving Twitter." All right. So Threads comes out. What happens? Threads surpasses GPT as the fastest growing app ever.

(00:30:08):
Now the headlines, Lenny, are coming. This is it. Zuck's a genius. It's incredible. And by the way, this sits inside one of the newer stupid axioms in Silicon Valley. So this is a side note, but when somebody says something in Silicon Valley that enough people think, "Yes, that's smart." They just parrot it. They don't actually think about it. There's a current thinking in Silicon Valley, and this was real loud as Threads was coming out, this was the reason why Threads was the Twitter killer. What you need, Lenny, is brand and distribution. That's what you need, especially distribution. I would assert to you that Threads had the greatest distribution advantage of any new piece of software ever launched. If there's another one that has a greater distribution advantage, I'd like to know what it is.

Lenny (00:31:11):
No, that seems right. Seems right.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:14):
Massive distribution, incredible, easy up and on, incredible. Free product, not even freemium, free. Awesome. And Facebook Meta, you tell me, one of the 10 most powerful brands in tech?

Lenny (00:31:32):
Absolutely.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:33):
How many users does Facebook have today, Lenny, do you know?

Lenny (00:31:35):
Over a billion? Might be more.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:37):
How many billion person apps have there been in the history of apps?

Lenny (00:31:42):
None.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:43):
Right.

Lenny (00:31:43):
I think.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:44):
Legendary brand, the greatest distribution advantage in history. What happened? It cratered. It's gone. It's still there, but nobody's there.

Lenny (00:31:59):
They're launching the [inaudible 00:32:00] soon so they have another shot.

Christopher Lochhead (00:32:02):
Oh yeah. Now why, why did that happen? Why did one of the richest people in the history of the world, who's potentially one of the smartest people in the history of entrepreneurship in tech, fail so miserably when the entire world said he was going to "kill," quote, unquote, Twitter? And after the initial, quote, "success" of Threads everybody said that's exactly what was going to happen. And now all those experts are surprisingly quiet. The legendary Kevin Maney said that category design is a new lens on business. It's a different lens. It's sits next to the product lens, it sits next to the competition lens, but it is equally important. So here's what happened with Threads.

(00:32:54):
They attacked an existing, well-known, well understood, incredibly well-defined problem with a direct copy. They even were celebrating that it was Twitter, just better. They said virtually those words. So known existing problem with a known existing solution that was, quote, unquote, "better" and integrated with the rest of the Meta shit. Quote, "Everybody checked it out and everybody went away." Why? Here's the aha.

(00:33:33):
Problems create categories, and you either have to A, solve a new problem, or B, reframe, name and claim an existing problem in a, I'm going to use these words on purpose, very different way. And if you reframe the existing problem such that people see it in a different way, that's when they'll be open to a new solution. But the mistake is the impasses is on the wrong [inaudible 00:34:11]. The impasses is on the product. Because we live in a world where just like the availability of oxygen, we believe the best product wins. Zuckerberg is going to blow in excess of a billion dollars on Threads and it will fail. It already has failed. Because you can't take an existing problem with an existing solution, launch exactly the same shit, tell the world it's better and have the world embrace it. Because the problem makes the solution the other way around.

Lenny (00:34:51):
So classic advice along these lines is, if you're, say, 10 times better than the existing product, you have a good chance at getting people to care and having success. Is there a line of just like it's the same thing but 10 times better? Or do you have to, in your experience, reframe? And I want to talk about that.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:07):
Let's just look at the evidence. We could agree that Jeff Bezos is not a dumb person, yes?

Lenny (00:35:14):
Yes.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:16):
Do you have an Amazon Fire phone?

Lenny (00:35:19):
I don't.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:20):
Neither do I. Why not?

Lenny (00:35:24):
I'm very happy with my iPhone.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:27):
And so, Bezos launched a better product and nobody bought it. And the reason nobody bought it is the problem. And therefore the solution that you think you're solving with your iPhone is solved with your iPhone. When was the last time you enjoyed a Red Bull Cola?

Lenny (00:35:48):
Not once.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:50):
Red Bull made exactly the same mistake that Zuck just made with threads. What Red Bull believed was, "We built one of the greatest brands in the world." Which they have, but they didn't understand why. The category made the brand not the other way around. Energy Drink made the category, so they go, "Great, we can put our brand on anything and it'll sell. So let's make Cola." They lost a bazillion dollars. It's reported that Microsoft lost somewhere between 400 and a billion dollars in Microsoft Stores. Did you ever go to a Microsoft store, Lenny?

Lenny (00:36:28):
I walked by them in the mall and I don't think I've ever entered.

Christopher Lochhead (00:36:32):
Well, they look exactly... If you remember, they look exactly like an Apple Store. And Ballmer famously told the team, when the Apple Stores took off, he famously told the team, "Go to the Apple Stores, study everything they're doing and let's copy it exactly." Google that shit, it's out there. Well, it didn't work. Why? Because you can't attack an incumbent category queen unless you frame, name and claim a new or different problem. Because when the existing problem is well understood and the existing solution is well understood, there's no need for a new solution. Even if people, quote, unquote, "hate Twitter," didn't do anything to Twitter, and now Zuck's going to have to write off probably over a billion dollars on Threads. And the funny thing is, Lenny, this just keeps happening over and over and over. Venture capitalists in the next five years will blow at least half a trillion dollars in the AI space alone, on me too, demand chasing existing category competing startups that have a 10x better product, no one cares.

(00:38:02):
And look, we're all going to sit here and watch them do it. And we, category pirates, and those of us in the category design world will say, "Told you." And they're just going to keep doing it. More importantly, because the big companies in many cases can afford to continue to fail and make this mistake. The tragedy in this is how many legendary innovative products never got to see the light of day because the inventor, the creator, the entrepreneur, believed in the product, but didn't know that every solution has to fit into a problem of value for people. And so their innovation went nowhere.

Lenny (00:38:51):
Let's talk about how to actually go about designing a category. You've used this phrase a few times, and that may be the best lens to approach it. If not, we can go at it from a different direction. But this idea of framing, naming, and claiming, how do you do that? What's that process like?

Christopher Lochhead (00:39:08):
Great question. It starts somewhere where most people don't want to start, and that is, the first law of category design is thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking. Thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking. If you're going to think about thinking, we have to define thinking. Now, the minute I start down this path, there's a meaningful percentage of people whose eyes rolling, going, "Here comes some bullshit," right? "Just tell me how to do the SEO, Lenny. Where's the SEO? Or where's the..." Whatever the tactical thing is.

(00:39:47):
So the first thing we have to do is break down thinking. Roger Martin is considered to be the greatest management thinker, or certainly one of them alive today. We were lucky enough to have him on the podcast when his most recent book came out, which if I'm remembering correctly, is called the New Way to think. People call him the new Peter Drucker. And he describes it as effectively as anyone I've ever heard. And at a high level, and this is me paraphrasing, so give me some license, but he's the source. At a high level there's two kinds of thinking, reflective and reflexive. And now, this is my editorializing. What most people think is reflective thinking is actually reflexive thinking. What's reflex versus reflective? Reflex is simple. You go for an annual checkup, yes?

Lenny (00:40:41):
I should be.

Christopher Lochhead (00:40:43):
Have you ever had a doctor whack your knee with the little pink?

Lenny (00:40:46):
Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (00:40:46):
And your knee goes whoop.

Lenny (00:40:49):
I do [inaudible 00:40:49] .

Christopher Lochhead (00:40:50):
And she's testing your reflexes. And that's an involuntary thing, when you're sitting on the doctor's table and your legs are hanging like a little kid and she goes whack, your leg just does this twitch, right? So that's a reflex. And reflexive thinking is very, very powerful. You have a driver's license, I'm guessing.

Lenny (00:41:11):
I do.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:12):
And when was the last time you were in a vehicle, driving?

Lenny (00:41:15):
Yesterday.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:17):
And if you're out on the road driving and somebody cuts you off, what are you likely to do?

Lenny (00:41:25):
I get a little upset and then I keep driving.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:29):
But I would assert, Lenny, you do something before you get upset.

Lenny (00:41:31):
I guess I try to avoid hitting this car.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:34):
Yes. And maybe you swerve, maybe you hit the brakes, maybe you do both. My point is this, the car cuts you off and we instantly, no thinking, react in order to save our lives, not damage our vehicles, not hurt anybody else. We didn't think about that. We literally just reacted. That's the way people think about most things. I say to you, Lenny, let's talk about guns and abortion and immigration rights in America.

Lenny (00:42:14):
No, thanks.

Christopher Lochhead (00:42:15):
Now you have opinions about those things, right?

Lenny (00:42:17):
I do.

Christopher Lochhead (00:42:18):
As do I. Most people don't challenge their own thinking. Most people say, "Now, why do I only think what I think about abortion? Where did I learn that? What do I really think about abortion? What do others think about abortion? Are there smart people in the world that I admire who are more educated and experienced in this field that have meaningfully different opinions than my own? There are. Why is that?" Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. We don't fucking do that, we say our opinion on abortion is the opinion on abortion. And in the United States of America in the political domain we say, "And anybody who thinks differently is trying to kill America." That's not thinking. So reflexive thinking is, what do I really think? Why do I think that? And in the business world, most people unconsciously assume the future is a continuation of the past. That's not what legendary entrepreneurs do. Legendary entrepreneurs don't just think they know the future is going to be different, because they're designing that different future. And the problem they're focused on matters to them so much that the fact that the problem continues to persist makes them batshit crazy. RJ... Is it RJ or JR? I can't remember now... The founder of Rivian, obviously Musk at Tesla, these guys are obsessed. It drives them insane. They don't understand why we're not all in EVs already.

(00:44:12):
And so my friend Mike Maples, the legendary venture capitalist from Floodgate, says, "The greatest entrepreneurs are visitors from the future telling us how it's going to be." And the reason many of them are so irascible is because the fact that the present is not already at the future that they see makes them insane. And so the point being legendary entrepreneurs and creators make the future different. They literally are in the design different futures business. Can I tell you a story?

Lenny (00:44:46):
Please.

Christopher Lochhead (00:44:50):
We're friends, and we've done some work with the guys who created Lomi. And Lomi is the first kitchen appliance in 20 years to earn a spot on the kitchen counter. A, it's one of the fastest growing new consumer items in the last 20 years. And B, if you think about your kitchen counter, do you have a toaster?

Lenny (00:45:19):
Yep.

Christopher Lochhead (00:45:21):
Coffee maker?

Lenny (00:45:22):
Yeah, I don't drink too much coffee, but we do have one.

Christopher Lochhead (00:45:25):
Any other devices on the kitchen counter?

Lenny (00:45:27):
We got a rice cooker and the rest is hidden away.

Christopher Lochhead (00:45:33):
Perfect. So what's Lomi? Lomi is the category designer of the smart home composter. Imagine a device that's one and a half or twice the size of a good size toaster. And what Lomi does is you take your food scraps, and it turns out that depending on whose numbers you want to believe, in America, we throw away somewhere between 40 to 60% of our food. And it turns out that food garbage, food waste is some of the most damaging to the environment. So what does Lomi do? You take your food scraps, you dump it into Lomi, you fill that shit up, Lomi's got a button on the front, you press that button, and what used to take three to six months to compost gets composted in three to six hours.

(00:46:29):
And even, this is weird, it smells good to me. Lomi did not say that, "we're better garbage, that we're different garbage, that we're better recycling." What they said was, "We are a different way of solving this huge problem." And they use both personal motivation, nobody likes throwing out garbage, nobody likes a big mess in their kitchen, et cetera, and an altruistic vision, which is... And oh by the way, if we do this, we will do something that governments heretofore have not been able to do, which is take a massive amount of environment hurting gases out of the atmosphere. And it turns out because of global climate change that we're creating more and more sand and we have dirt traces. Lomi dirt has been shown to be amongst the most nutrient rich dirt in the world. Here is a company with a breakthrough technology that truly makes a difference in the world with a business model that allows them to build a highly profitable high growth business.

(00:47:48):
And the way they got there was by designing a new category and showing the world why, by making room in your tight kitchen for this new device, you'll make a difference for your family and the world. And if all they had done was what, by way of example, Dean Kamen did when he launched the segue, which is, isn't this cool? Nothing would've happened. So my point is, the Lomi guys designed a product, a company, and a new market category. They created demand out of nothing for, I think the average price is around 400 bucks. The sum total of the market for smart home composters when they launched was fucking zero. And their vision for the new category was so compelling, Jay-Z was one of their first investors.

Lenny (00:48:53):
I have their site up. Thinking about this framework of, frame it, name it, claim it, they framed the problem in this unique way of... Is it the framing of the problem or framing of a solution? The framing step, best way to think about that.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:09):
There's something in category design called languaging, which is the strategic use of language to change thinking. And a mistake that a lot of entrepreneurs make is they use old language to describe their new thing. And we can't use so much new language that nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about, so we have to meet the category where it is and bring them forward, but we have to create new language. Can I share with you one of my favorite, most recent, favorite category design stories in this regard?

Lenny (00:49:42):
Please.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:44):
You've been on an elevator, yes?

Lenny (00:49:45):
Yes.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:47):
Have you ever looked at the floor and seen a logo on the floor of the elevator?

Lenny (00:49:53):
I can't recall. I imagine it.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:55):
Well, if you do, you'll more than likely see this name, Otis. Otis Elevator. Most people don't know why Otis is the category queen of elevators. Well, here's why. Elisha Otis invented the elevator. Now, pre-Elisha, there were no skyscrapers. Because how could you get to the top floor? How could you build the top floor, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So when he creates the elevator, there's no known problem for it to solve. So he demonstrates it, people think it's cool. He shows it at like fares and shit. Because the big problem with prior elevators was they would crash. And so he built this safety system to catch them if the wiring would crash. And the category name, he actually used, Lenny, he called it the safety elevator to address the current problem in the space, which is... I don't know. People still went, "That's interesting, but why do I need a safety elevator?" It's a solution with no problem.

(00:51:14):
So what does he do? Languaging. And in category design, one of the breakthroughs is this thing called a point of view, which helps you frame, claim and name a problem and educate the world on why they should move from the way it is to, we call them frotos, from to, a new and different way. So Elisha has to make the market, there's zero demand. It's what many of our smart VC friends call a zero billion market, which is what you want. So what does Elisha call it? The vertical... Railway

Lenny (00:51:57):
Beautiful.

Christopher Lochhead (00:51:59):
And people understand what a railway does. It moves people and shit this way. And he said, "Great, we've now got a vertical elevator that moves people and shit this way." And if you have a vertical elevator-

Lenny (00:52:11):
Vertical railway.

Christopher Lochhead (00:52:12):
A vertical railway, thank you. You can have a new category of building. This is no different than anybody today, for example, in the technology space, who's building a new part of the technology stack for AI. So if you've got a new important security layer for AI that enables a new highly secure AI application. From a languaging perspective, if you just use existing languaging, you'll be like Elisha in the beginning where people go, "That's really cool, man. Fucking A, didn't think that was technically possible. Wow. It's like you've broken gravity, dude, incredible. Don't know why we'd ever need this. See you." And he goes, "Wait a minute, wait a minute. What if it was a vertical railway?" "Well, what could we do with a vertical railway?"

(00:53:09):
This is why thinking matters. The way you think about the problem, the way you frame claim and name the problem. One of the core tenets, Lenny, in category design is listen to the words. Listen to the words. And when you listen to the words, you will hear things that you don't normally. And so he created new languaging, what in category design is called a point of view, to frame, claim and name a problem, which is, how do I move up and down versus across land? And in so doing the aperture of people's minds created what you could think of as new mental scaffolding for a whole new kind of innovation. And thanks to Elisha Otis, we have tall buildings.

Lenny (00:54:01):
I really like this idea of languaging. Are there any other examples come to mind, awesome examples of languaging in action that worked out?

Christopher Lochhead (00:54:07):
I got a bazillion of them. Another one of my favorites. When Starbucks first starts a coffee is 10 cents. You sit there and you go, "We can't make money at 10 cents." That doesn't make sense, right? Unit economics don't work for what we're trying to get done. If the ASP in the industry is 10 cents, we want to have an ASP of three bucks. Fuck. Well, here's the aha. It's very hard to charge three bucks for a thing that everybody currently pays a quarter for, if you call it the same thing.

(00:54:50):
So they create new languaging, they teach, they literally teach consumers new language. That's why you and I walk into Starbucks and say, "I'd like a double grande latte, please." 25 years ago, that was not languaging that you and I used. And they use it as a mechanism for radical differentiation and radical value/price differentiation. And they made up the fucking word. It sounds kind of Italian, vente. But the truth is, by the way, it's a milkshake, but that's a whole other conversation. They're the number one milk seller in the country. They're a milk company, not a coffee company. But that's, again, a whole other conversation. The point being, if you want to charge three bucks for something that heretofore has been 10 cents or a quarter, change the language. And you know it's Starbucks language. Where I live, there's a shit ton of new hipster independent coffee shop type places. Where they paint the Mona Lisa in your latte before-

Christopher Lochhead (00:56:00):
... where they paint the Mona Lisa in your latte before they give it to you and all that shit. If you walk into one of those hipster places and ask for a double grande latte, the super hipster gal or guy behind the counter with the nose ring and shit is going to give you a bit of a grizzle, because you are using Starbucks languaging in their location, and that's the other breakthrough. This is really important in the technology industry, the company that creates the languaging for the category wins.

(00:56:39):
Oh, you see that today, OpenAI. Not that long ago you did not hear the term large language model. Correct?

Lenny (00:56:51):
Correct.

Christopher Lochhead (00:56:52):
That was not a term we were talking about.

Lenny (00:56:53):
That's right.

Christopher Lochhead (00:56:56):
And today the entire industry is talking about LLMs. Here's another thing that they created, training data. Well, those of us who've been around for a long time, we understand what data is. We know what a database is, we know what data in motion is, we know what data at rest is. We know what structured data is, we know what unstructured data is, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

(00:57:19):
I'm not a data expert by any stretch, but I've been in the industry for 37 years, I know some about shit data. We'd never heard the term training data, and I'm still frankly looking for a breakthrough in languaging to describe it to people, because I think when most people realize the difference between data/content and training data, there's a massive breakthrough that can occur there. The languaging is still not sufficient, but we're getting there.

(00:57:53):
New languaging creates new thinking, and a demarcation point in language creates a demarcation point in thinking, which can create a demarcation point in perceived value, and she, who changes and or creates net new value perceptions wins.

(00:59:20):
I think you've made a very compelling case for why people should design a new category. To give people one more tactical tool for coming up with and figuring out the category they want to go after and framing it and even naming it, you mentioned this idea of having a point of view. Maybe that's the best way to approach this question, or maybe there's another framework of just how can people best think through and spend time thinking about what this new category they should be creating ends up being?

Christopher Lochhead (00:59:51):
Great question, Lenny. Two things, at least. First, spend more time on the problem than the solution. There's a very early stage, security startup I'm working with right now in the AI space that's doing absolutely mind-boggling things, and the founders have incredible backgrounds with large transaction systems and deep security, just an incredible company.

(01:00:21):
I had a call yesterday with the founder and some folks on the product team just getting an update on where they're at and this and that and the other, and we're sort of starting to want to talk to people externally. We've raised a seed round, VCs are coming, they're very ... Anyway, we're sort of slowly starting to want to come into the world and begin to have a conversation.

(01:00:46):
The founder CEO sends me a text yesterday and says, "I'd like you to, if you're open to it, have a call with so-and-so. He's a very important person, knows a lot about our space, blah blah. Known him for a long time," dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Great. I said, "It sounds wonderful, but why? What's the purpose of my conversation with so-and-so?" The founder literally said to me, "I would love it if you would be willing to invest some time in listening to some of our customers to hear from their perspective what the problem is and what the solution could be, not just from me and our team."

(01:01:27):
That is a founder who's obsessed with the problem. That's the first piece. The second piece of advice I'll give you, I mentioned Mike Maples, he's got a very powerful way of framing this. He calls it backcasting as distinct from forecasting. You're nodding your head, you're familiar with this.

Lenny (01:01:54):
Yeah, I've read this in length in the show notes, it's amazing.

Christopher Lochhead (01:01:56):
Yeah. Here's the idea. What most people do is you and I are entrepreneurs, we have this idea for a product, this problem we can solve. We think we're going to be bazillionaires, we think we're going to help a lot of people, we think we're going to have a lot of fun, and so we have at it. And whether we realize it or not, the mental scaffolding we use goes like this: Lenny and Christopher are sitting here now, we have these big dreams. We think, let's say, five years out into the future, "What do we want to do? Oh [inaudible 01:02:32]. Why don't we go through all the dreams? Great." Then we ask ourselves, most of this is subconscious and then it shows up in business plans and other things, "What do we need to do to get from here to there?" Have you ever done any backcountry hiking, Lenny?

Lenny (01:01:56):
Yeah, I have.

Christopher Lochhead (01:02:52):
Yeah, so if you and I were going to go on a four or five-day trip in the Sierras, we would have a start point, right?

Lenny (01:03:00):
Yeah, absolutely.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:02):
And we'd know where we were coming out, right?

Lenny (01:03:03):
Mm-hmm.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:04):
And we'd have way points along the way, yes?

Lenny (01:03:06):
Yeah, probably.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:09):
Because we knew we were going to be out four days or six days or whatever, we would try to plan our food appropriately.

Lenny (01:03:14):
Absolutely.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:14):
And the whole plan would be predicated on "We're going to start here and we're going to end here," and what do we need to do to get from where we start to where we end, yes?

Lenny (01:03:25):
Mm-hmm.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:26):
Now, when going on a backcountry hike, that's a very smart fucking thing to do, because if you've ever been on a backcountry hike and you're four days in only to realize you don't have enough food, that's an experience you don't want to recreate. Okay, turns out that while that's highly effective for a hike, it is intergalactic disaster for a startup. Here's why. Your point of reference is everything. Thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking.

(01:03:59):
When we do it that way, mentally we are standing in the present, which is an extension of the past, and we're saying, "What do we need to do to go from this present to the different future we want, and what are the obstacles in the way?" Here's the mental scaffolding. That's forecasting, here's backcasting.

(01:04:26):
We do an exercise, we abandon everything. In category design you get taught to what's called reject the premise, so I reject everything about the way that it is, all of it. You and I now envision this future five years out and everything's gone incredibly, it's exceeded our expectations. We make that true in our minds. We write out, we brainstorm out "What's it going to be like? What kind of technology are we selling? What are we doing for customers? How big's our company? How many people will hire?" Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Then we say, "Okay, standing in that future, five years out, looking back to the present, what did we do to make this different future happen?" That's category design. That's how you unshackle yourself from the past. See, one of the biggest disservices in our industry is this word disrupt. "Oh, [inaudible 01:05:26] we're going to go disrupt the engineering industry." Nah. Well, if you're disrupting something, by definition, your reference point is the something. And when your reference point is an existing thing, your reference point is the past. If we want to be able to think in unconstrained ways about a radically different future, the more we drag the past forward, the worse off we are. What reject the premise teaches us is let's forget everything we know and start fresh. My friend, a legendary designer, John Bielenberg, does this course on innovation and design with kids in university. He does this multi-week exercise and the objective of the exercise, Lenny, is design a bicycle. That's the objective. And there's only one design point. It cannot be rideable.

(01:06:25):
And the reason John makes him do that, his philosophy, he calls it thinking wrong. That's his version, if you will, of reject the premise. The reason for it is when you take away the premise, it must be rideable, you open up the aperture for legendary new thinking, radically different possibilities, radically different futures. This is the mistake that many, many entrepreneurs make, is whether they realize it or not, what they're doing is incremental better and they're fighting for market share, fighting for existing demand with something that's incrementally better. And the reality is that's why most entrepreneurs fail. Now, you could fail doing it exponentially different, it sounds medically insane to say "What you want is a zero billion dollars market." However, as crazy as it sounds, it's the only thing that leads to meaningful success. And the proof is in the data.

Lenny (01:07:34):
Yeah. You talk about this in your writing, that on the surface it feels very hard and expensive to design a category, build a category, convince everyone this is a new problem. But your point is there's no other option really if you want to build a large business. Is that right?

Christopher Lochhead (01:07:49):
Correct. And the other thing is people say, "Oh, it's really expensive and it takes an amount of time." As compared to what? You've lived a lot of your life in the product world, yes? As have I. Well, if you ask smart VCs, if you ask Brian Roberts at Venrock, the number one healthcare tech investor in the world, I believe he says it's eight to 10 years for a product to really have some maturity and be really stable. And I don't know whether he's right or not, but he's a super smart guy. We know how long does it take to create a legendary culture, how long does it take to get a legendary innovative business model to really hum. "Ah, it's mainly hard." Well, so is building a product, so is building a company, so is raising VC, so is doing sales, so is doing marketing, so is doing HR. If you want to be easy, go work at the fucking DMV. That's point A.

(01:08:53):
Point B is the reality, Lenny, when you look at it, the vast majority of innovation comes from startups. People say, "Only big companies can do this." Listen, my collaborator partner Eddie Yoon, is the Obiwan Kenobi of category design in the Global 2000 Arena and particularly on the consumer side. And he will tell you that most of these major companies... And he's worked for, you name a big food company, you name a big beverage company, he's worked for many of them. They fail miserably. The reality is six people with a small investment from a rich uncle can stand something up that has the potential to be worth $3 trillion dollars. That's what Apple is.

(01:09:52):
And I sat there with Don Valentine and asked him about why he signed the check to Steve and Steve, and he said it was the stupidest use case he ever saw. The use case was a stay-at-home mom, keeping track of her recipes on the Apple personal computer. This is the stupidest use case ever. However, Don could see the potential in the category and in the guy's willingness to go get after it. And so for a VC, if you're going to raise money, the VCs who invest in early stage mass potential companies are the ones who see your different future.

Lenny (01:10:40):
Along those lines, I had this note that you had this quote around product market fit and it's this hot take that product market fit is a very dangerous idea. I'd love for you to speak to that, because I think most people are in the opposite camp that it's the only thing that matters. Why do you think it's such a dangerous idea?

Christopher Lochhead (01:11:01):
There's a bunch of these product myths. Product led growth is another one, but let's go to product market fit. And God bless Mark Andreessen, he's the guy that framed it. And Kevin just wrote a really super thoughtful piece on why it's backwards, and I'm happy to send that to you if you want. Kevin Maney, genius. Here's the aha, again, category design principles. Listen to the words, product, market, fit. Product market fit. Now, let's think, what there is for me to do is find a way to fit my product into a market.

(01:11:48):
Pretty simple way to determine or to distill product market fit. And what product market fit has come to mean is, we're a brew pub, you and I want to start a craft beer place like everybody else on the West Coast, and we're going to make a bunch of samples and shit, and we're going to feed those samples to our friends and to our ideal customer profile that I learned from Lenny. And if enough people amongst my friend group and my ideal customer group say, "That's a yummy IPA, I like it," then we're going to build it. And then if people start buying that IPA, we have, and these are the words people use, "achieved product market fit."

(01:12:43):
Okay, well, Threads achieved product market fit faster than any product in the history of the world. Here's the aha, categories make products not the other way around. What you want is you want to design a market category for your product, not fit your product into a market category. And the problem is, our industry, like many others, but the tech industry, is full of product bigots, because they really, really, really, really, really believe, like they believe in the availability of oxygen, the best product wins. They really believe it. And they believe what marketing's job is, "Could you put a demo on our website and get a demo? Can we get a viral video that's a demo? Because once people see how much better, faster, cheaper, smaller, bigger, whatever our thing is, they're going to buy it," and they don't. What they buy is a new insight around a problem/opportunity that requires a different solution. That's what they buy. Here's another simple example. This is the one I hear right now a lot, "What we need now the story, we need a story brand. The number one thing you can do in marketing as a startup founder is to share your startup founder journey. Share your journey." This is all the shit we're hearing. We've been hearing this for a while. Well, guess what? No one gives a fuck about your journey. They really don't. You know what they care about? Themselves. Their problems, their needs, their opportunities. For our book, Snow Leopard, we did the first ever comprehensive data science research ever done using Nielsen data to study nonfiction books. And we know that because what Nielsen told us, and we had to sign an NDA that would choke a horse in terms of what we can say and can't say about the data. But one of the things we wanted to understand is what categories of business books sold and which categories didn't and why. We can get into all that if you want, but here's the aha. Guess what the number one category of business books, nonfiction books is by a mile.

Lenny (01:15:13):
Oh my god. Sales? Marketing, marketing-sales. No.

Christopher Lochhead (01:15:19):
Personal growth.

Lenny (01:15:20):
Okay, that makes sense. Self-help.

Christopher Lochhead (01:15:22):
Self-help. And number two, personal finance. Biographies are way down on the list. The point being, no one cares about our product. No one cares that it's 25 mega flips faster, cheaper, whatever, they don't care. You know what they care about? Them, their needs, their wants, their problems. And categories are about customers and their wants, needs, problems and opportunities. Branding and marketing is about our product. And the greatest innovators in the world don't stop at innovating a product or technology. They design a new innovative market category where they standalone.

Lenny (01:16:12):
We're definitely going along, which I expected. And we've actually gone through most of the questions I had, but I have just a few more to close out the conversation. One is positioning. That's something you hear a lot about. How do you think about positioning versus categorying? Are they essentially the same thing? Is positioning just a way to phrase and describe your category? How should people think about that?

Christopher Lochhead (01:16:32):
What positioning today has become is essentially how do I tell a story about my shit in a unique way, in a compelling way? That's really what people mean when they say positioning. The parts they never stop to consider, again, listen to the words positioning as it relates to what? Because you, again, listen to the words and fucking think, "You position against competitors." How do we position against the competitors? That's a phrase people use. The question is, what are you positioning against? And the answer to that question almost all of the time is competition. If you're doing positioning in that context, you just decided you're fighting for 24% of the demand designed by somebody else. And we think in the tech space where one company earns two thirds of the economics, if that's your starting point, you fuck yourself from the start. To put it simply, positioning in the modern context is for losers. That is to say people who are fighting over the 24%. That's positioning.

Lenny (01:18:15):
I love it. Getting spicy over here.

Christopher Lochhead (01:18:17):
Well, it's factually correct. People go, "Oh, [inaudible 01:18:21]." Okay, so you mean to tell me that in tech one company doesn't take two thirds of the economics? Okay, believe that. And you can believe gravity doesn't exist. It does, but you can believe that Bigfoots are installing misters on 5G towers to make us all sick, if you want. You can believe anything you want, it doesn't make it true. What's true is one company wins and everybody else gets fucked. That's what's true. Look at any space you want. You want to go back to your list? We can go through the list. Positioning has become sort of category design for the cowards. It's like, "Well, I know that we could really be as radical as to create our own space, so let's just see if we can carve off our little niche over here." Okay, great.

Lenny (01:19:20):
A big part of positioning, just to expand on this a little bit, is differentiation. Differentiating yourself. People always talk about the importance of differentiation. Do you see that as the same potential pitfall, or how do you think about differentiation?

Christopher Lochhead (01:19:34):
Okay, this is really, really powerful. In category design, we don't compete, period, full stop at the brand to brand or product to product level. Category designers do compete, but not against a product, not against a company, not against a brand. Category designers compete against the status quo. Let me be specific. There's a category called cycling. You look like you might be a biker, Lenny, are you?

Lenny (01:20:09):
Very casually, mostly an e-bike.

Christopher Lochhead (01:20:13):
Those are really fun.

Lenny (01:20:14):
They're so fun. Mountain bike. Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (01:20:16):
But you've been on a mountain bike. You've been on a road bike, you've gone out with friends, done this, right?

Lenny (01:20:20):
Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (01:20:21):
Anybody who bikes on any kind of regular basis has been in an accident. And if you bike on a real regular basis, you've been in an accident with a vehicle that was not caused by you. That's true for every person I know that rides a bike on any regular basis, myself included. All of a sudden a new category shows up, and that new category is called indoor biking classes. And the category designer is a company called spinning.

(01:20:53):
And they say, "Hey, biking's great. It's an incredible source of exercise, but you don't want to get killed doing it, so come take a class." And what they're doing when they do that, they're competing category to category, not brand or product to brand. And that's a strategy that's called damming the demand. What does a dam do? There's a bunch of water running in the direction, a dam takes that water, stops it and moves it, does something to it. Interrupts it and changes it. Here's what spinning does. They say, "Why risk your life on a bike when you can take a wonderful class and not have to worry about it and get your exercise?" What dam the demand, Lenny, is you thought you wanted this, but what you really need is that.

(01:21:52):
Then what happens? The next iteration in that space comes from Peloton. Again, when Peloton launches, they don't say, "Hey, our bikes are better than spinning bikes. Our bikes are 12 mega flips, faster, cheaper." They don't do any of that shit. They don't shit on spinning, they don't attack spinning, they don't attack road biking, they don't do any of that stuff. They say, "Why drive to the gym when you could do it at home?" They dam the demand for spinning, they don't compete against it. And they reframe the problem called "How do I get a great workout in a group environment without getting killed?" And they achieve that massive success.

(01:22:41):
And I can give you many other examples. The mistake is competing directly product to product. The enemy is the status quo. That is to say the way it is now. If you go back to Lomi, the enemy, the way it is now, the status quo, is a nasty garbage in your kitchen that stinks and smells and gets all over the floor that you have to drag to the green bin and then the squirrels and the fucking raccoons eat it. That's the personal upset. And the environmental one is, we're destroying the planet. No, by the way, rather than destroy the planet, why not create this super awesome compost dirt? In category design, we call that a from to a Frodo. Category designers are leading the world from the way it is to a new and different way. They're not saying, "My carbide ingulator is better than their carbide ingulator."

(01:23:32):
Here's a simple example. This is another reason the word disrupt doesn't work. Les Paul is the innovator of the electric guitar. Today most guitar players have an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar. Matter of fact, most guitar players have more than one, very few guitar players, some, but very few said, "Oh, now that the electric guitar is invented, fuck the acoustic guitar." Very, very rare. The net new category called electric...

Christopher Lochhead (01:24:00):
So the net new category called electric guitar as opposed to the prior category, acoustic guitar, actually increases the overall guitar TAM. Doesn't disrupt shit. So in that case, you're actually creating net new demand. In the Peloton example, you're both creating that new demand and you're getting your start. And this is where I think a lot of the discussion that you have and a lot of your work, Lenny, around growth, is really powerful, because what's really going on when growth works is effective digital damning of demand. That's what's really going on, when it works.

Lenny (01:24:41):
I think somewhere maybe wrote this, "Damn the TAM" is an awesome phrase. If you haven't, you should use that. Damning the TAM, increasing the TAM. So you have a number of books you put out. I'm going to link to all these. Play Bigger, I think, was your first, Niche Down is the other. And your newest book, I believe is your newest book, is the 22 Laws of Category Design. So maybe just as a last question, can you just share a few of these laws, maybe two or three of your favorite laws from the book just to give people a sense of the book?

Christopher Lochhead (01:25:09):
I think we talked about law number one, which, in a lot of ways, is probably the most important. Another one to think about is something we call the magic triangle, which we've touched on, but maybe not explicitly, which is, in order to build a legendary company, you've got to get product, company, and category right at the right time. And so some people hear the category design discussion and they think it's somehow pejorative to product as if product doesn't matter. The reason for category design is because we love the products. Products fail because they don't get category designed. So I think the aha of the magic triangle is product, company, and category are equal in importance, and so getting that right I think is very powerful.

(01:26:05):
I'm just riffing off the top of my head. I don't have it in front of me. Another example is lightning strikes versus peanut butter. So what most marketers do is they take their marketing budget for the year, they quarterize it, and maybe there's slight variance in the quarters, but essentially it's a similar amount of spend. And they do campaigns. And they do "keep the lights on" and maybe they launch a product and maybe they have a big push around the product. And they're trying to drive the funnel and they're trying to deliver sales or deliver leads, B2B, doesn't matter. And that's what they do. And what they don't realize, Lenny, is that approach, that peanut butter approach, is predicated on almost 100-year-old mental scaffolding and marketing called reach and frequency. And what reach and frequency was about, which was, I want to get my shit in front of the most amount of people the most often possible.

(01:27:07):
And if you listen to a lot of the shysters and hustle porn stars, the Gary VDs, and this is of the world, "You got to release 400 pieces of content today on every platform." All this stupidity. That's just a reswizzle of reach and frequency from over 50 years ago in the new medium. Well, it turns out reach and frequency doesn't work. Because the number of marketing messages we get is massive, they're experts who say we get up to 60,000 a day, whether it's logos on coffee cups or ads on the internet and everything in between. And so it's virtually impossible to stand out in a reach and frequency mode. Now I'm not saying you shouldn't be doing keep the lights on marketing. Of course you need to do keep the lights on marketing. But, here's what the lightning strike model and category design teaches us. I'd rather matter for one week a year than be irrelevant for the rest of the year.

(01:28:07):
And so what we did, candidly Lenny, was we ripped off Hollywood's model for launching movies. We said, "What if you did that as a software company? What if you launched a thing, be it a product or something else, the way Hollywood launches a movie?" And so what a lightning strike is about is getting very, very clear, if you go back to your ICP thing, "Who's our ideal customer? Where is that customer? Where does she hang out?" Ideally, in the digital world first. One of your recent episodes, I was listening to the Growth Hacker Gala, how she went on to Reddit and stuff. That's a well-known strategy and I love that strategy. Go hang out where they are, put something provocative and engaging in front of them, and matter in that moment. So the idea of a lightning strike is, if you are in our target audience for that day or that two days, we are going to be all over you.

(01:29:09):
We're going to be undeniable. And so we put a disproportionate amount of our effort, if we're in B2B, probably one to two lightning strikes a year. If we're in B2C, two to three. One a quarter if you're a really big company. It's hard to pull off one a quarter if you're a smaller company. And much more than that, if not a lightning strike, it starts to blur back into peanut butter. But, that is a very powerful concept. On the execution side for marketers, that's different. The other thing I'd say and probably should have started here, so I'm a three-time public company CMO. I've advised over 50 venture-backed companies in category design and marketing. Guess what I've never seen in a marketing plan ever?

Lenny (01:29:59):
What's that?

Christopher Lochhead (01:30:00):
Word of mouth. This boggles our minds, those of us in category design, because WOM is was and always will be the most powerful form of marketing. And in the native digital world, WOM can spread in a way that was never possible on the analog world for all the reasons we all understand. So if you take the concept of a lightning strike, then you take the concept of a category point of view that is all about frame naming and claiming a problem. And then there's one other concept I'll introduce.

(01:30:32):
It sits next to your ideal customer profile. It's what in category design we call super consumers. So it turns out that in most categories, roughly eight to 10% of the buyers are responsible for the vast majority of the profits. And more importantly, they are the zeitgeist. They are the thought leaders in the industry. They are the customers, the users, the purveyors of whatever the thing is that others look up to as being the ones to admire, the ones to aspire to, the best practices, et cetera, et cetera. That's a super consumer. Okay. So in category design, when you understand who your supers are, i.e. your ideal customer profile, you understand where they are primarily in the native digital world, how do we go hang out? And remind me what that gal's name was? I thought she was awesome.

Lenny (01:31:23):
Meltem. Meltem Kuran Berkowitz.

Christopher Lochhead (01:31:23):
Melson?

Lenny (01:31:26):
Meltem. M-E-L-T-E-M.

Christopher Lochhead (01:31:29):
What a name. That's a great name. Anyway, I thought Meltem was awesome. She's absolutely on point. So we know who our ideal customer, aka super consumers are. We know where they hang out in the native digital world. We have a radically compelling different point of view about framing, claiming, and naming a problem that, if we do effectively, we'll resonate with them. That's why we spend time crafting that POV. So we evangelize the problem. We participate in a native digital community where they already are. And we do it from the perspective of not a marketer, not a seller, an educator. We're teaching people about a new and different way to think about an existing problem or a problem they hadn't thought of, that when they have an aha moment, because we articulate it well with our point of view, they go, "Oh, tell me more about that problem."

(01:32:21):
Right? As they do that, we take an education standpoint, mental framework to it. We open them up, we participate, and sooner or later somebody says, "Huh, tell me again what you do." And bam, away that we go. And here's the aha. When you understand supers, you understand the targeting, you understand a radically different point of view, reframing the problem, presenting a radically different solution. Well guess what? It's the ultimate growth engine. And you can grow for a very small amount of money. You could send email to 300 people and drive a breakthrough in sales.

(01:33:05):
Why? Because when you take this approach, you're not just driving near-term revenue, very, very important, you are driving WOM. A big part of why you want to have a point of view that can be articulated very quickly is marketing's job is to put the right words in the right mouths and to get that WOM to scale. And so when we have a category POV, that's about them, not us. Remember, brands are about us. Categories are about customers. We care about what they care about. And so when you have a powerful category POV, that drives WOM. And then when you do that in the native digital world, you get a tremendous amount of uplift from native digital viral WOM. And category design is the only business strategy whose primary execution focus starts with WOM.

Lenny (01:34:06):
What an awesome way to wrap up our conversation. It's basically a very tight go-to-market strategy is what you just shared. For folks that want to dig further, I'll just share a few of the places they could learn more. And then Neil, at the end, I'll ask you where to point people. But, you have an awesome Substack category, pirates. That's substack.com. You have your books, which I think maybe the best way to, I guess you tell me, is to find them as go to your last name. com, lochhead.com, L-O-C-H-head.com. Is that right?

Christopher Lochhead (01:34:34):
Yeah. And of course you can go to category pirates.com.

Lenny (01:34:36):
Okay. Even easier. Amazing. So we have the lightning round coming up. Is there anything else you want to share as closing words or advice before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Christopher Lochhead (01:34:47):
Yes, I do.

Lenny (01:34:48):
Okay. Let's do it.

Christopher Lochhead (01:34:51):
So I'm 55 years old, Lenny. I started my first company when I was 18. I got thrown out of school. I don't have a GED. And I've been in the tech industry the whole time. And the first thing I would share is anything's possible. Don't listen to anybody who shits on you. I've a chat on as much as you could possibly imagine. I have four or five different learning differences. ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was told I couldn't read. I was certainly told I couldn't write. I've written 14 number one fucking bestsellers, et cetera, et cetera. And so my point is, if you are somebody for whom you want to spend your professional time working on the exponential different as opposed to the incremental better, which I got to believe is a meaningful percentage of the people who consume your shit, if you want to work on the incremental better, incremental better is important.

(01:35:52):
I want the Boeing engineers working on the incremental better. I don't want the air traffic control system that's the exponential different. No. And a lot of incremental improvement over time can be exponential. So if you're a product manager and you're running a highly successful product with a massive install base, and you're looking at your next rev, and you're trying to figure out of the 472 features that you could build. What are the 26 that really matter? And you want to go talk to your customers to find out what those incremental improvements are and to stack rank them into all that good. PRD, MRD, IUD, all that shit. There's a big place in the world for all of that. It's incredibly important. That's not category design. So with that said, I think, Lenny, we are at the greatest time in history for our industry.

(01:36:48):
I think all the indicators show that the amount of innovation that is going to happen in the next five years will eclipse the amount of innovation that happened in the last 20 years. It's accelerating. AI is insanely exciting, dangerous, concerning. Do we need to focus on the downside? Do we need to be smart? Do we need to be thoughtful? Do we need to learn? Do we need to work with regulators and legislators? Absolutely. Could it go horribly? Oh, sure. But, that's always true. AI feels a little bit different, but it's always true. And for the record, the Luddites are always wrong. The point being now is the greatest time in history to be a creator, to be an entrepreneur, to be a marketer. I've been a marketer for my entire adult life. It's never been greater than it is right now. And so here's the big thing that I would share.

(01:37:43):
If you are somebody for whom you want to make an exponential difference, you want to innovate, you want to create new value where there wasn't, you want to have a legendary career where you can look back on your career and go, "You know what? I was part of this and that. And I was on this team." Now is the greatest time in history. And what I would say to you is the future needs you. Most people are not working on the exponential different.

(01:38:14):
And so the future of our world requires that the innovative people, that the entrepreneurial people stand up, take advantage of these incredible technologies. And a lot of people, particularly in my age group, Lenny, shit on millennials, Gen Z, what are lovingly referred to as native digitals. Absolutely not. I'm inspired by them. And I think the next generation of our entrepreneurs will be our greatest generation of entrepreneurs. So my point is, now's the time. The future needs you. Don't listen to any of the bullshit. I don't care what the boo birds say. Absolutely, go for it because there's never been a greater time to design and dominate new categories of innovation than right now.

Lenny (01:39:02):
I love that message. You're just passion and energy for creating and inspiring comes through really clearly in all your writing. And so I love hearing it in person. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Christopher Lochhead (01:39:22):
Richard Bach, Illusions. And then in terms of business books, I'll share with you one, because I know people recommend all the same shit. I'll share with you one that I think it may still be in print, but if not, it's easy to get. Mark McCormack's What They Don't Teach You At The Harvard Business School. So on the personal side, Richard Bach, Illusions. And for one that you may not have heard of Mark McCormack, What They Don't Teach You At The Harvard Business School.

Lenny (01:39:55):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Christopher Lochhead (01:39:59):
Oh, right now we're watching Designing Anna or Inventing Anna or whatever that's called. So that's been fascinating to watch. I think it's been incredibly well done.

Lenny (01:40:10):
What a wild story, that one. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates when you're hiring people?

Christopher Lochhead (01:40:18):
So there's actually two. And I'll start with the second most important interview question, which I think is the most important question. But in a job interview setting, for me it's the second most important. And that is, it there anything else? And you know this as a podcaster. I end every single one of my podcasts with, is there anything else? And the interesting thing about that question, you can spend three hours with somebody talking about very important shit. You can think you got all the detail. You could have asked all the questions about the technical architecture and the campaign and the distribution and I don't know what.

(01:40:56):
And at the very end you say, "Hey, Susan, before we wrap, is there anything else?" And often, Lenny, the most important thing for that person to communicate comes out then. It happens so often, it's bizarre. I use that in medical situations. Family member is in the hospital going for an operation. "Okay, doc, tell me." I tell you all the shit. Is there anything else? I will tell you that eight times out of 10, the most important thing about the surgery with your loved one will come after that question. I will even use it during a conversation as we transition from various different points.

(01:41:37):
So in an interview situation, maybe you're asking somebody about their background. You might say, "Well, is there anything else about your background you think I should know?" It's the most powerful open question. But in an job interview situation, it's my second favorite. My first favorite is, so Lenny, are you legendary?

Lenny (01:42:01):
You want me to answer that?

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:03):
You can if you like or not.

Lenny (01:42:05):
No.

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:06):
But, the answer to that question...

Lenny (01:42:08):
What are you looking for?

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:09):
... Is always radically illustrative. I'm not looking for anything. I'm looking for your answer. Some people will say, "Yes." And they'll tell you why. Some people will say, "Well, that's a big word." Whatever they're going to say. But, it is a purposely provocative question with one of, I think, the most powerful words in the English language, because I want to get a read on that person and how they respond to a purposely provocative question about themselves.

Lenny (01:42:42):
Amazing. Okay, just a couple more questions. What's a favorite life motto that you like to repeat yourself or share with other people?

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:50):
If you're lucky enough to make it to the top of a mountain, throw down a fucking rope. And for me on that, Lenny, I'm somebody who has had and continues to have a radical amount of love and support in my life. When I was young, I started with nothing and I got thrown out of school. And I didn't know until I was 21 because when I was young, learning differences weren't a thing. And by the way, the way most of the world and education system deals with learning differences is completely fucked. But, that's a different conversation. It's definitely improved, but it is nowhere near what it needs to be. And so I just think that we should never be held back by those views of others. And so we need to be unencumbered.

Lenny (01:43:42):
I love it. Final question. It's a dumb question. Maybe to lead to something fun. You're a category pirate. Do you have a favorite real pirate?

Christopher Lochhead (01:43:51):
I have actually a lot of favorite pirates. I'll tell you about one of them. His name is Tony Etherington, but virtually nobody calls him Tony. Virtually everybody calls him Doris. And Doris is a legendary surfer and surf explorer from the Gold Coast of Australia. And I went on my first ever boat tour, surf adventure in Indonesia with Tony.

Lenny (01:44:22):
You make this giggle.

Christopher Lochhead (01:44:30):
There's a horrible story I'm thinking of telling you. Anyway, you haven't been with a real pirate until you've been in stormy seas at night with Doris smoking cigarettes, drinking Jack Daniels in the bridge thinking maybe we're going to die, but this guy's probably not going to let that happen. And so Doris Etherington would be one of my top pirates of all time. And he's got the voice. And he's got the attitude. When I was having problems surfing, he would say to me, "All right, sit you down mate." Always smoking a cigarette. He's like, "I'd smoke long if we could have ciggyed up now." He goes, "You paddle out, wait for the biggest wave, lean into it, and get right up on it."

(01:45:21):
And so in our world, get right up on it is has become an expression for go for it. So I think we can all heed the words of Doris and get right up on it.

Lenny (01:45:36):
I love that this question led to something fun and interesting. Chris, thank you so much for being here. This conversation was entertaining, insightful, spicy, fun, funny, everything I hoped it would be. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and keep reading? And then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Christopher Lochhead (01:45:54):
Probably categorypirates.com is the simplest spot to go. And how listeners can be useful to me?

Lenny (01:46:03):
Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (01:46:04):
It's what we talked about a moment ago. The future needs you. And the future needs the people who have the courage to make a difference, because the people who are different are the ones who have made the biggest difference. Every time. And we live in a world where we are rewarded for our sameness, for fitting in. Our education system teaches us what we're trying to do is find our place in the world. And listen, some of us do. I know people who wanted to be a vet from the time they were kids, and that's the path they chose. And they became vets. And they love it. And they're wonderful people. And they have great careers. And they make a giant difference. And they've always known. And fucking a. And so if you are somebody for whom you have found your place in the world, congratulations. That's awesome. And we also know, particularly in the innovator, entrepreneur, creator, marketer world, many of us, there was no place.

(01:47:13):
And so my hope is that you either find your place or if you realize there's no place for you, that you further realize that you can make your place in the world. And fundamentally, that's what category design is about. It's about making a distinct, unique place in the world for yourself, for your product, and for your company. Because the people who are different make the biggest difference. And so the great thing that people can do for me is to go into the world and make a different place for themself in a way that delivers massive value to others.

Lenny (01:48:00):
Beautiful. Chris, thank you again so much for being here.

Christopher Lochhead (01:48:04):
Lenny, bless you. I love all things, Lenny. Thank you.

Lenny (01:48:07):

# Lessons from scaling Stripe | Claire Hughes Johnson (ex-COO of Stripe)

## Transcript

Claire Hughes Johnson (00:00:00):
What I say to people at Stripe... In our onboarding, I used to run a session. I was like, "If you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you. And I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to like slow the whole company down. Follow a process and get it done, and don't forget to actually make a decision. And if you don't know who the decision maker is and you're worried it's not, you just ask. Don't get stuck." Too many people get stuck and it makes your work terrible, right? What do we all care about? Progress, impact, momentum. If anything I would say about advice to people generally is be a force for positive momentum and it will be actually a real career maker.
Lenny (00:00:50):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Claire Hughes Johnson. Claire was most recently chief operating officer at Stripe for the past seven years, where she helped scale them from a small startup to the legendary company that it is today. Before that, she spent about 10 years at Google where she was VP of self-driving cars, VP of global online sales, director of sales and ops for Gmail, YouTube, Google Apps, and AdWords. Before that, she was in politics. She's also on the board of HubSpot and the Atlantic. And this week, she's releasing an incredible book called Scaling People, which in my opinion should be and likely will be on every founder's bookshelf. In our conversation, we dig into many of the meaty topics that her book covers, including building your operational cadence, defining your company and personal operating principles, your company's operating system.

Also, tons of tactical advice around saying things that you cannot say, building self-awareness, distinguishing management from leadership, so much more. I say this a couple times in our conversation. If you enjoyed my newsletter and podcast and the fact that it's very tactical and full of templates and frameworks, you'll love Claire's book, and you'll love learning from Claire. I had such a good time chatting with Claire, and I know you'll learn a lot from this conversation. With that, I bring you Claire Hughes Johnson after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or are you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies.

Claire, welcome to the podcast.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:04:49):
Thank you, Lenny.
Lenny (00:04:51):
So you wrote this book. It's called Scaling People. It's coming out this week. I actually read a preview copy, and it's incredible. Everyone listening to this should buy it, especially if you're a fan of this podcast. It's full of frameworks and templates and guides and all these things that I try to do with my newsletter and podcast. And so if you like what I do, you're going to love this book. And I can't imagine how much work it must have taken to write a book like this. So my first question just have relieved are you that you're done with this book and you can move on with your life?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:21):
I am so relieved, Lenny. Writing this book was not my idea. Patrick and John Collison, Stripe's co-founders, really sort of pushed me into it. And I'm glad they did. I will admit that, as I am with most things they pushed me into, but it was a lot more work than I thought it would be, and it's very rewarding to have it done. Of course, though I've been re-looking at it and realizing there are things I want to add information or tweak what I originally said, but maybe we'll have to do a second edition. We'll see.
Lenny (00:05:55):
That's the benefit of a newsletter. I can just edit things and they're immediately live.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:59):
Yes.
Lenny (00:06:01):
I want to talk about John and Patrick a little bit. But before that, something I wanted to ask is I find that when I write stuff, I am able to better understand and crystallize my own thinking. And I'm curious, having written this book, what is it that you were able to better understand and crystallize in your own thinking through that process?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:06:20):
It's true, and it's funny, because if you asked me, I would've said I crystallize more by talking and speaking. But whenever I do write something down, I'm glad I did. So I probably do more crystallizing by writing than I would admit, but maybe I'm just lazy and I just like to talk. There's a part of the book, I think it's toward the end of the third chapter, which is about hiring, and that's a really long chapter. Turns out I had a lot to say about hiring and hiring leaders and processes and what you need want to set up. And as I got toward the end of the chapter, I found myself saying to the reader... You maybe have read this and thought, is she for real? You need to do all this work? You need to put all of this in? And I had to say, well, look... I started the chapter saying, if you believe that talent is everything, then your hiring process is everything.
(00:07:11):
And so yes, you do need to put that work in. But I think, Lenny, to your point, when you see all the templates and the frameworks and the examples and the advice from my career... And I was at Google for almost 11 years, I joined Google when it was about 1800 people pre IPO and left when it was about 60,000. I had eight different jobs while I was there. And then joining Stripe when it was about 160 people, and now we're over 7,000 people. Yeah, I have a lot of examples, but really what's crystallized is how much work it is to build, to build a company. You know this. And I hope this book is a bit of a shortcut, but there are no shortcuts. I hope it will accelerate people's knowledge so that they can get down to work with our product and with our customers.
Lenny (00:07:58):
There's a story you share at the end of the book, I think it's in acknowledgements, about how people went and took John Collison out for dinner and were just picking his brain, and "How did you scale Stripe? How did you build this amazing machine of a company?" And he often came back from these dinners, and he's just like, "Claire, they just want to talk to you. You did all these things, not me." And it sounds like that kind of encouraged you to write things down, and then led to this book. One, is that true? And then two, I'm curious, what else did you learn from John and Patrick Collison that have stuck with you? I imagine there's a lot, but kind of what stands out?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:08:31):
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think it is true that at Stripe, we're fortunate where we have so many users, customers who are themselves founders or interesting companies growing up around the world, whether at scale like Amazon or scaling. I've spent time with Discord and Toast and all kinds of interesting companies that are growing up around us. And a lot of their questions are not necessarily about Stripe's products always. They're really about, "Well, how do you guys do this thing?" Or "We're having this challenge. Are you having this challenge?" And John, yeah, would often come back from trips. He would travel more, and he is often probably meets with more customers than anyone in the Stripe leadership team, maybe other than our sales leaders. And they would ask about scaling, and he would joke. He's like, "We need Claire in a box." So I think the book is Claire in a box, I guess.
(00:09:23):
But Patrick also would have that same experience. And when I contributed a chapter to Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook, even though if you look at High Growth Handbook, which I also really do recommend not just because I'm in it, I'm probably the least, I don't know, celebrity participant in his chapters, and my chapter got a lot of traction because I think it was very specific. It was very tactical. And Elad actually helped me to realize, look, examples and details and frameworks, my working with Claire document is in there, is like... He said it's catnip. And I think that is also what inspired Patrick to push me to do basically a longer version of that chapter that I did with Elad. But I've learned a lot from both of them. I used to think that I was... My parents are teachers, Lenny. I used to think I was very curious, and I'm a learner and I'll seek out information.
(00:10:21):
And I grew up in a very educatory environment, right? Well, once I met the Collisons, the two of them are huge sponges, seeking out knowledge constantly. But also, anytime we were confronted with anything, even things I felt I'd done before, that I had the experience and we were going to build it, they were like, "Well, who have you talked to?" Or "What have you read?" And it was really good. I don't think I made enough phone calls in my earlier career and asked people's advice and asked for help and found the person who did that thing five years ago and found out what they learned. And I think that's probably my biggest lesson from working with both of them, is how much it pays to seek out knowledge from others because we're all just learning all the time.
Lenny (00:11:11):
Is there a story or example of that comes to mind that was really beneficial where you actually ended up follow that advice and reached out to someone, talked to someone, and that changed the way you think, changed the way you operate?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:11:21):
There are two things that just jumped into my mind. The first one is early on at Stripe... When I joined, we were about 160 people. I started bringing in some leaders. We were building out go to market, we were starting to stabilize our support operations, building out recruiting and HR, all the things. We were really growing. And it became very apparent that we needed to put in some kind of job structure. Levels and ladders is what you would call it, which is there are different levels of pay, and they have to do with your experience and your impact and their expectations of those different levels, right? There's an engineering ladder. And this stuff is probably making some people listening like their skin start to crawl because it's never fun or easy to define all that, and it's not perfect. You're immediately getting into something that feels pretty suboptimal, but it is worse to have nothing because it starts to feel very unfair in the environment, especially if you have to start to change up compensation and reward or reward systems, right?
(00:12:24):
So I realized, oh my gosh, we're going to have to put this in place. We didn't know HR people, so I basically ran a project. And the first thing I did though, thanks to Patrick and John, is I talked to Square, I talked to Airbnb, and I talked to two or three other companies. But those two conversations, I'm not going to say who said this, but one of them, the person said, "Oh, that's a blood bath." They were not encouraging about what we were about to go through. And another one said, "You know what? I'm so impressed that you're doing that so early. We waited too long." And actually, that's what a lot of my book. It's about is when should you start to think about this thing that you might need, right? And it's sooner than you think. And so putting in levels of ladders felt like ripping the off, honestly, but I was glad. One company I talked to waited until they were like 800 people, and it was apparently not fun because people don't like to be... Who likes to be categorized?
Lenny (00:13:26):
Yeah, and put it at a level that maybe they're not happy with, right? They're like, "Oh, I thought I was a lot more senior than that."
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:13:32):
Yep. Yeah, exactly. It's not easy. It's a form of change challenging. And I would not say we did it perfectly, but I'm glad we did it. I think that example was definitely one of them. Another was like we were really... We wanted to roll out 24/7 support in multiple channels, email, phone, chat in multiple languages and getting from where we were to where we wanted to be as quickly as possible. Not many companies have done at the scale, because Stripe has millions of customers. We're B2B, but we're B2B at a very high scale, which actually Google was as well. And so that was beneficial to me coming into the Stripe environment because I'd done parts of that for Google. And again, that's an example of something I thought I knew how to do, sort of, but we certainly didn't do it perfectly, and it's certainly different when you're talking about payments.
(00:14:24):
That's people's money. That is a business'... If they don't know how to contact you and they have a problem, that is a huge issue. And so I did seek out a lot of advice. And I would say... Did anything change dramatically what we did? I think if anything, the advice pushed me to go faster on some of my intuitions about, for example, using vendors and outsourcing parts of the model. And I realized we're not going to scale all this internally, especially not at the speed that we're going, but it's hard to start to use outside sort of contractors if you haven't filled figured out all your tools and processes. So that balance was sort of freaking me out, but you just got to push through it.
Lenny (00:15:15):
There's a couple directions I want to go, but I'll go in an unexpected direction. At Stripe, you're kind of infamous for your titles. When I created this career ladder document.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:24):
[inaudible 00:15:24].
Lenny (00:15:24):
Yeah, it's like everyone's product manager., They're like a VP of product potential and it's like product manager. What's the rationale behind that? I guess, and what's the benefit of that? But, we don't have to go too far down the road. I'm just curious.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:37):
So this is something that Patrick and I actually really agreed on without a lot of discussion, which is not always the case. It has to do with a combination of optionality as you scale and grow, and also culture, right? And so the minute you start titling a lot, you're signaling hierarchy and authority. And the culture piece to Stripe still today, which is I think we could use more, at least more overt trappings of structure because it can get confusing. And I'll be the first to tell you that, and I admit that this might have carried on too far. But early on, at Stripe, there's a real belief. It's not a particularly hierarchical company. And if you're the person who has the knowledge, you are the expert on the thing, you better be, one, in the room helping make the decision, and two, driving, helping to drive the decision. And I don't care how senior you are, right? And that was the cultural signal that was important, which was about mutual ownership, and also expertise not sitting in hierarchy.
(00:16:43):
And then the optionality thing is probably a little more obvious, which is don't make somebody the CMO, or even the head of marketing, if you're marketing team is two people, right? Yeah, you might make the right choice, but two years later, your marketing team's probably going to be more than two people, say it's 20. And are you going to have to layer somebody or have too many titles? And then someone feels like they're losing something, right? It goes back to the levels and ladder saying, but it's worse because you've given something, and then you're sort of taking it away, and that's just not... Organizationally, you want more flexibility. Honestly, I'll say my final thing, which is I have a little bit of a knit where you meet a company. I get what's happened, which is in order to hire this person, they had to sort of say, "I'll make you the VP of sales or the VP of this," but the company's like 25 people and there's seven VPs.
(00:17:40):
If you're a customer or you're evaluating it, you're kind of like, "Really?" It's a little incongruous with the scale. So we kind of more flexible. We had a lot of growth, head of this or growth lead. I know you're all about growth, Lenny. Well, we definitely took growth and find that very broadly. But the other thing I've said to people internally... Sorry, you can really get me going on this one. I bet you didn't think that. If you are a stripe and you're going out into the market, actually it speaks to the same thing, which is you're going and trying to sell to a customer who's a lot bigger than you. I'm not saying make up a title. Don't say you're the VP of sales, but you can be creative about how you represent your scope because you probably have really big scope because you're one of the only people helping to sell the product. And that will help you because a lot of more established mature companies are trying to do that hierarchy match, where "Well, bring your SVP because my SVP is coming to the meeting."
(00:18:42):
And we could be like, we don't really have that. It just gives you a little more selling flexibility too.
Lenny (00:18:48):
I like that. I like combo where you can just say something that fits in this situation, even though that's not your technical title.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:18:53):
Yes, you can say, "Oh yeah, I actually am in charge of optimization for our payments product." I'm sure you are. I'm sure that's what you
Lenny (00:19:01):
Do. Coming back to something you talked about with the career ladder, and I had a question around this, you talked about how oftentimes people do it too late, and I'm curious why it's so important to think about the stuff that you wrote about in this book so early in your company's life cycle. I think in the book you mentioned that it's oftentimes as important to get your operational structure and cultural structures in place incorrect as finding product market fit or finding your first few customers, which I think would surprised a lot of people. Can you talk about why you found that to be so important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:19:35):
Not only can I talk about it, I wrote a whole book about it, so let's try to restrain me. But here's what I would say. Obviously product market fit is the most important. And what I do say in the book is focus on that and don't get too far. My book is definitely not zero to one. It's more like maybe 0.5 to 1.5 or one to two. Because I do think when you're smaller and focused on product market fit and finding your user and getting that traction, that shapes a lot of how you work and your goals and who you hire, and that all makes sense. I think the thing that happens though is, one, some companies don't quite realize they're hitting it and they start to get behind on actually building the company part. Because guess what?
(00:20:23):
It turns out product market fit is just the product, and that is not a company, and that will not scale, to point. You see these companies that sort of fall over and there's sort of a bad article about them, and often it's not the product, it's the fact that they didn't actually build the company very well, and that started to harm, in fact harm the product and harm the mission. You have this vision, you're going to solve this problem with this product. And all of a sudden you can't solve it because you didn't scale the org properly. You didn't keep the cultural fabric strong as you grew, right? And so that's why I think it's so important. And so let's say you are hitting traction, and hopefully you do notice it. Because I think a lot of founders, you're kind of paranoid.
(00:21:08):
Like Stripe, I don't think Patrick and John fully embraced that they needed to start scaling maybe until I showed up, and that was part of hiring me. I was like, yeah, this is it. It's happening. It's not just look at the numbers. It's like look at the inbound support demand, look at the inbound sales leads. I just did the math, and I was like, this company should be probably twice the number of people it is right now, which of course freaked everybody out, but it was very obvious to me because I was coming in outside with that perspective. But more importantly, not just scaling things like sales and support... And as you probably know, if you work in payments, you've got a lot of other functions that are very important around risk and compliance and you name it, or the machine learning models and that help you do those things.
(00:21:55):
But for the sort of structures and operating processes that I talk about in the book, I do have this analogy which I think you picked up on to building a house, which is you have the supporting beam. Say it's a post and beam structure. You need the posts and the beams, and then you're going to have to do the mechanicals, right? There's going to have to be some amount of wiring in order for you. I don't know if you have your solar panels, but you got to bring in the heat, you got to bring in the cooling and plumbing, and then you have foundational stuff that you have to build or the whole structure will fall over. And I think of putting in the posts and beams and the mechanicals and the foundation as actually essential to scale. Because if you do those things well, you build them in such a way. This is almost like a Russian doll kind of thing, but you build them so that they're replicable, right?
(00:22:49):
So the way that you do goals as a company can start at the company level, and this is how OKRs were so beautiful for Google and they can replicate down to the individual. And the same common structure allows that to happen at really different levels of scale. And that's what you're looking for, is what are these common things? We do not a lot of them, by the way. You don't want to mandate a lot, you don't want to put too much structure in place, but enough that everyone can play with it up and down what I would think of as the stack of the company. And if you don't start putting those things in early, people will just invent those things. And then you'll have... Picture a house that got added on to 17 times and it's not even two years old. It looks not super stable. And then you're going to find yourself having to do a tear down, which I think we've all seen companies do that.
Lenny (00:23:40):
I definitely want to get into that house structure and all the components of it. But before we get there, if you're a early stage founder just looking for product market fit, maybe the skipping ahead a little bit, but which elements do you think are the most important that they need to do now? Because they're going to read your book, which gives them so much advice on all the things you can do.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:01):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:24:02):
If you have to pick a couple things that you have to nail when you're just starting out before product market fit, what do you think is most important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:08):
I think really that early, keeping it very simple and being focused on that goal of product market, which is like what is the problem you're trying to solve? What's your vision?Everything you have to do for an investor pitch deck matters not just for the investors. By the way, people forget this. A lot of the story you tell to investors, early ones especially is the story you should be telling internally to anybody you hire. Why do we exist? What problem are we trying to solve? What early customers have we attracted, and what's their feedback. That's what you mostly need, but you need to remember to share it and don't just use it for fundraising, or don't just use it for a board meeting or an investor meeting. Use it internally. And I think you can get pretty far actually with that core content. As you start to...
(00:24:56):
The first thing you're probably putting in place is a little bit of hiring process, and I think that's going to matter sooner than you think. Don't just be tempted to hire people in your friends. Think about what you need, what capabilities you need to build even pre PMF, right? And so as I said, there's a chapter about that, but I think some of the simplest versions of it is how do we evaluate talent? What kind of talent are we looking for? Where do we go look for talent, figure that out, and sort of train people a bit internally on interviewing. I think interviewing is not a skill that comes naturally. People think it does. It does not. And there's really basic easy tips and tricks you can find even on the interwebs about interviewing. And I really recommend... And my book has examples of rubrics, questions you can use. How do you really get at... Because it's hard to really evaluate someone in 30 minutes or 45 minutes.
(00:25:49):
So I think interviewing some of your fun fundamental early investor kind of content you need. But then when you start to get some traction, then you're showing to codify and actually document what I call more foundational content. Because if you're pre-product market fit, you're probably small enough that you just can tell everybody all the things. You don't have to send them the packet or have them sit in the onboarding. But the minute that you're starting to get any kind of hiring speed, you're going to want to document it more and you're going to want to start to put some very lightweight processes of how you get things done in place, because again, you're trying to replicate velocity. It's easy when you're all in one room and everyone knows like, "Oh, this is the most important thing to get done today," hack, hack and hacking away. But then pretty quickly, that is not going to be the case.
Lenny (00:26:38):
I definitely want to go one layer deeper on that, but there's this area I wanted to get to before we dive into some of the weeds around that, which is I found it really interesting that you started your book with this idea of personal operating principles versus here's how the company should work. It starts with here's how you should think about yourself. So I want to go... There's four of them... But before I get into them, can you just describe what is the idea of a personal operating principle and why is that important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:27:02):
Remember the book is about two things, company building and company structures, and all that, replicating all that good step and management. So the other thing that the book is really about is management tactical guides to... It would be easy to build companies if there weren't humans involved, right? But there's humans and they're complicated, and I'm complicated and you're complicated. And there are things that motivate us. There are things that demotivate us. They're not the same things, though Lenny and I, I think you and I have some things in common, but point is the book starts with you. And I think a lot of people think management starts with the team, or even the company. And actually, I think founders make this mistake. Founders think, well, it starts with my product. And yeah, but it actually starts with you. And so the book starts with sort of my belief system, which is self-awareness, which is the first operating principle. Self-awareness to build mutual awareness is actually the most fundamental thing you need to crack if you're going to succeed at company building or management, in my opinion.
(00:28:08):
But I would say I'm one of those people who has strong opinions that are pretty loosely held. This one is a strong opinion strongly held, which is the more that you can seek feedback, seek to understand your motivators, your strengths, your blind spots, your tendencies, and take that on board and expose it to others, you're going to be a much more effective company builder and manager. So it starts with you. And those operating principles that I articulate are sort of mine, but they're also foundational to the content of the whole book. I do think authentic leaders tend to have their own, right? Lenny, you probably have a few that you... You maybe have not articulated them all out loud, but I do have mine and they're in the book, but I think you would also find that some of them you could adopt. If you were looking for were some to start to use as a leader, I would hope that I've put forward a couple that might be useful.
Lenny (00:29:04):
I want to talk about these four, but while you're on that topic, what are ways to help crystallize your own operating principles? What advice would you give people to do this? Because to your point, people probably have them in their head, but they haven't really written them out.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:29:17):
That's right, they haven't. The book has an exercise that I recommend in it that's a little bit more about crystallizing your personal values, but that's kind of the place you want to start. And it's essentially there's a whole menu, and you can find these online, of say 70 or 80 different values. And by values, I mean family, ambition, impact competition. People value education. People value different things differently, by the way. And there's no judgment. You might value being a very competitive person and I might value collaboration above competitiveness, and that's fine. We probably would both be very effective in a team for different reasons, right? So basically if you take a list of values and you say, okay, if I had to pick 10 of these that matter to me, then if I had to pick five of them, and then you really force yourself if I had to only pick three of them...
(00:30:09):
And it's actually good to have this in a dialogue with someone that you work with or well, and you sort of had to explain, well, why? Why, when I'm really pushed, do I have to hold on to say education or learning as a value? Or why do I have to hold on to integrity as a value? And I tell a story in the book about a manager I worked with where transparency was a very important value to him. And the thing is you usually have a story behind that value, right? And in the book, I use the name Eli for him. Eli ends up sharing this story at this offsite that we had. And the transparency value actually was a little bit problematic to manage because Eli would tell everyone everything, including his team, even when we weren't finished with the plan, right? But Eli got up and told a story of being younger, like seven or eight, and realizing his mother was very sick, and no one really told him what was going on.
(00:31:07):
And then unfortunately watching the process of her dying and then being taken out to lunch by his stepfather and told, "Your mother is gone." And okay, well, your whole worldview kind of explodes when you hear that, and you're like, oh, okay, this transparency thing is really real. This was a formative experience for him and it has changed how he operates, and it will probably have changed it for his whole life. And if you can get to that point on your own, of telling yourself, what was the story? What was the thing that made this so important to me? Then you're starting to be in a mode of self-discovery and then you're starting to document, okay, if these are my three top values, and here's why. And then I think what you want to look for are my, what I would call my work style tendencies? And so you get your values, and then you sort of go on a... I'm sorry, I could go on about [inaudible 00:32:08]. I warned you. I wrote a book about this.
(00:32:09):
But basically, all these work style assessments, Myers-Briggs, DISC, Enneagram, you name it. And by the way, I would take all of them because I find that very good. I mean some of it's just data. You're just taking on data. But a lot of them come down to are you introverted or extroverted? Are you more introverted or extroverted? Where are you on that continuum? And are you more task, if you kind of picture a horizontal and a vertical, are you more task or people oriented? And so I would take your values, and then I would plot yourself. Am I a more extroverted task-oriented person, which means you're kind of a director, get what done kind of person? Or am I a more extroverted people-oriented person, which might mean actually you're probably great at being very charismatic and building some followership and maybe selling a vision? A lot of salespeople are very extroverted people oriented people.
(00:33:03):
And then you start to see, okay, if this is my sort of tendency in my default and this is my value system, what are the ways that I operate that really make up who I am and becomes almost a belief system. And my operating principles in the book, one is to build self-awareness, to build mutual awareness. Another one is say the thing you think you cannot say. I think that I've come to believe that often your biggest strength, one, is also your weakness, but two, is something that you don't know is a big strength because it's almost like breathing. For me, saying something actually fairly openly and directly but in a non-threatening way is a thing I do. John Collison actually once said to me, he's like, "It's so interesting when you give feedback, that can be actually pretty brutal, I leave feeling really optimistic."
(00:34:02):
But I don't mean to be brutal, but I think I can sort of unpack and say this thing, like here's my observation, here's going on, and it's not judgmental, it's not threatening, it's actually opening up an opportunity for people. So say the thing you think you cannot say. You would actually find that more of us can do that. And then I come back to distinguish between being a leader and a manager, which is something early in my career, I did not do well, Lenny.
Lenny (00:34:30):
Before we get to that one actually, just to briefly ask you a follow up question, because I love that you're getting through all four here. This is great. But I was going to ask, is there something.. So clearly, you're really good at saying the thing you cannot say, and I love that. Many people are not good at this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:30):
No.
Lenny (00:34:45):
Do you have any tactical advice for someone that is not good at this for how to actually say something uncomfortable?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:51):
I think the main thing is, and Fred Kaufman has this in his book, Conscious Business, this concept of a left hand... He calls it the left hand column, which is you're in a dialogue with me or you're watching a meeting happen, and you've got a running commentary in your head. And honestly, some of that stuff is pretty harsh, right? You do not want to open your mouth and just say that thing. But what Fred says is, learn how to detoxify the left-hand column. I would say think about a way to say that thing that you think you can't say. You've filtered yourself out, which I don't like. And I want you to think, okay, can I? And I think that the... Here are the tricks, a couple of them. One is, ask a question.Right? A question is not threatening. By the way, the question could even be, is there something we're not talking about? It feels like to me... And then you own.
(00:35:47):
So the next trick is you own it. This is your observation, this is your perception. This is not a judgment. I am not saying, "Lenny, I think you really botched that interview." That's not useful. If I said, "Lenny, you know what? I wonder if you missed an opportunity in that interview. Did you feel like you missed an area that..." And then you're kind of curious. You're like, "What do you mean?" And I'm like, "Well, I'm kind of looking at this with you, and I'm standing next to you and I'm observing it." Right? That's less threatening. So one, ask a question. Two, make an observation that you own. So if I said, "I feel like there's something we're not talking about, and I wonder..." Oh, I own it. "I wonder if it's the fact that these two teams both seem to have the exact same project."
(00:36:32):
I talk in the book about a meeting I was in where it was very clear that we had two teams in conflict, and no one was saying the thing that was really pretty bad. I was like, this is pretty bad. We have two teams that seem like they both own a piece of work and are in conflict with one another. But I would say if you do those two things, ask a question, own the observation yourself, don't pass a judgment, you will get way farther than you would've ever thought sharing. And by the way, that sharing, one, there's probably other people who just haven't, can't get it out of their head, and you have ar opened up a door that a lot of others can probably walk through. You're not alone.
Lenny (00:37:12):
You have this framework, I think you call it being explorer, not a lecturer. Is that what you just described? Is that how you describe it?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:37:18):
It is. And to me, what I just talked about was more of a meeting or a conversation scenario, but I think that this... I'm glad you brought that up. I think this is actually a very fundamental management framework of mine, which is in a one-to-one interaction, your job as the manager... First of all, too many people think your job as the manager is to be the expert and tell people what to do. No, actually, your job is to enable people to be their very damn best on your team. And you have to create an environment and a context and provide them information, and then you need to provide them a form of coaching. Now, again, I think people start think coaching is lecturing, like let me coach you how to make this Excel model. And sometimes they do. Sometimes someone comes to you and says, "Can you exactly show me how to do this thing?"
(00:38:05):
Fine. But most of management is actually exploring with someone. It is being curious. It is saying, "I have seen this pattern of your work. Have you seen this pattern? Is there something..." I have a whole other framework which is about hypothesis based coaching. I think intuition as a word gets kind of a bad rap, and I kind of get why, look, especially if you work with a lot of engineers, which I do. It's not particularly always data driven, but guess what a scientific hypothesis is? It's a well-informed piece of intuition. And I think too many managers wait until they have a million pieces of data to make an observation to someone about an area for improvement. Instead, I would say take some data, form a hypothesis, and then explore it with the person. Because if you're well intended, which I think any good manager is, I'm bringing up this thing because I'm trying to help you see it and tell me if it's true so that we can both help make it more effective, better.
(00:39:11):
One very light example could be, "I felt like in that meeting... How did you feel that presentation went?" And the person sort of says, "It's fine. I think I got through the material." You say, "Yeah, I felt like you were maybe a little bit nervous. I'm just exploring. Were you..." And by the way, the person could say, "Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no." And then you could back off, or you could say, "Oh, well, maybe it was just me, but I noticed some physical. Your leg was shaking a little bit, your voice, you were kind of repeating yourself." And they're going like, "What?" And you're all you're doing is holding up a mirror... And you have to own it. You have to say, "My experience of you in that meeting was that you seemed nervous to me. Maybe you were not, but actually maybe this is just a physical coaching thing."
(00:40:04):
Have you ever had that? I have a few people on my teams who do this weird thing. This is pre virtual world, but when they're sort of getting it uncomfortable in a meeting, they put back their chair up off the table, sort of exit the circle. And that is a very physically big statement. And they had no idea, Lenny. They had no idea. I'm just watching the meeting, and I'm like, oh my gosh, you're like four feet from the rest of the group because you do not like this topic. And what I need to explore with you is how do you vocalize that instead of physically exiting the room or exiting the circle? These are just examples. Sorry, I could keep going. But I really think that that attitude of exploration and mutual sort of collaborative, let's discover some things about you...
(00:40:54):
And by the way, it can be mutual. They can go right back at you and say, "Well, I observe this." Great. Great. I've interviewed a lot of people for the book, different leaders and managers from lots of different fields, but one of them was Reid Hoffman, who's a more typical. But Reid, we were talking about the other operating principle, which is management versus leadership. And Reid was pretty honest. He's like, "Look, I'm more of a leader. I'm not a manager." He's like, "I'm not a great manager." And then he told me the story. He's like, he had in his first company that he was building, he had a guy that he'd hired who was more operational. And Reid was sort of making an observation to him about something they should do, and the guy goes to him, "Reid, I wouldn't hire you to manage McDonald's."
(00:41:42):
And Reid was like, "Okay, good. So tell me what we need to do so we can fix this thing." But what actually Reid's operating principle, interestingly when unearthed that whole thing, was that he prides... It's very important to him to create an environment of open feedback. He said, what I love about that story, yeah, it's funny and embarrassing, but actually that guy was comfortable saying to me, "I wouldn't trust you to manage a McDonald." And I think that actually I found inspiring because I don't think everybody who founded a company or who's managing someone has created an environment with how much trust in it, right? And that's how Reid thinks he gets a lot of stuff done, is people just come right back at him with the feedback.

(00:43:19):
So we've done three of the operating principles that you personally use, which I love. I love that you're going to going through [inaudible 00:43:25]
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:24):
Distinguish management and leadership is the third one, yep.
Lenny (00:43:28):
And then just to summarize real quick, the second one was to say the thing that you cannot say. The first one was-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:34):
Say the thing you think you cannot say, yeah.
Lenny (00:43:36):
And then first, build self-awareness to build mutual awareness.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:39):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:43:41):
And what's cool is you're sharing all these amazing stories and tactics. In the book, you actually have templates to do each of these things for yourself. So a lot of this is pointers too. If you actually want to do this, go check out the book and you can actually do this. It's not just in a bunch of high level stuff. And then the fourth is-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:57):
Come back to the operating system.
Lenny (00:44:01):
Let's talk about it.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:44:02):
So this one is, sort of like I was talking about, touchstone documents that you might create for your company. This is our operating principles, our values. This is my touchstone, which is I think that especially high growth environments, but every environment you operate in can get really chaotic, and there's a lot of ambiguity. There's a lot of stuff you don't know, and it's kind of easy to get paralyzed or to sort of give into the chaos. And you're like, oh my gosh, I don't know what this day is going to bring. I'm just going to randomly assign some stuff, and I'm just going to get through it. And all you're doing in a lot of those moments is creating more chaos. And I think a really important role of definitely managers, but some leaders too is to create a stability when there doesn't feel like there's a lot that's stable.
(00:44:52):
And where stability comes from is in ritual and in common practices that you share. So we set quarterly goals or monthly goals. And that's a ritual, and that's a thing we do, and it's actually a source of stability. And yeah, it feels like a process. It might feel like a way of managing, but it also has a cadence to it. And I think one of the things that happened is you picture yourself sort of spinning out of control. You think, how do I come back to this is the order I do things, this is how I get decisions made, this is how we make plans, this is how we make decisions. Those touchstones are not processes to run the thing. If they're done well, they're stabilizing because they're a common way of approaching that everybody has, so they can at least hold onto that even when all the other stuff is going haywire.
(00:45:45):
You've got a customer churning, and you've got a big launch happening the next day, like, oh my God, oh my God. Come back. What's our launch? How do we launch products? We have a way of doing that. We do not need to spin out of control and reinvent the wheel here, right? And that's a stabilizing thing. And the other thing on come back to the operating system for me was, as my career scaled, as I went from a individual contributor, to managing a small team, to managing a bigger team, to managing multiple teams, to managing managers, you get it, I realized actually, and I started to have multiple functions. So I was context switching between... At Google, there was a point where I had some product people, industrial design operations, really BD, really different functions. Actually, how I fundamentally ran them at the bare bones, at the house architecture level was the same.
(00:46:38):
And that gave me a stability as a leader where I would dive into a meeting. I'd be like, all right, let's look at the metrics that matter. We all had... We had them for every team. Let's look at the goals we set. And that also helps you stabilize when your contact switching between seven different projects or seven different teams. And so I wouldn't say it's the operating principle that I talk about the most, but I think if you were like, "What's your sort of... How do you scale yourself?" I would say, "Well, I actually have a common operating system like a computer, and that is how I maintain a sense of stability."
Lenny (00:47:17):
Perfect segue to the next kind of broad area I want to spend time on, which is this house metaphor and the three components of it that you talked about. And this is like the core of the book. Can you talk about again, the three kind of pillars of this house structure? And then let's just go through each of these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:47:33):
Yeah, it's definitely, the beginning of the book is about company building, and the company structure chapter is all about the sort of supporting beams, the mechanicals, and then the foundational stuff. And interestingly, it's sort of, well, I guess when you build a house, you build the foundation first. So one is the founding documents that you might create, which I'm happy to talk about. And then another are the supporting structures, which are some of the ways you do things we talked, like quarterly business reviews or OKRs, or how you use planning to create a structure that everyone... And then the mechanicals are what I might call the operating cadence, which is essentially the rhythm of how you work, right? The calendar, the year that we all experience tends to dictate a little bit how we work. Mondays feel different than Sundays, right? Well, companies have that same kind of a cadence, which is often also calendar driven, but also can be event driven.
(00:48:28):
We've talked often at Stripe about how our customer event, which we have called Stripe Sessions, is as important internally as it is for the customers because it's a forcing function for our cadence, how we plan our products, what we want to have achieved by that point, what we want to demonstrate. And that's true for a lot of companies, but we actually use it in our thinking about our cadence of the year. And actually, we've built this other event that I usually help run, which is an internal event that happens generally about six months before that, which is great because you can demo the stuff you think you want to demo internally. You sort of create a cadence of we're going to push ourselves to do some crazy wild stuff, internally demonstrate it, and then see if we can externalize it by the time we hit the customer event.
(00:49:16):
But that is a cadence. Quarterly business reviews are part of your cadence, et cetera. So that's the fundamental, but really while I'm trying to do is say, one, I don't think this stuff is super hard. You know this. It's kind of hard work. It's just putting it in place, and then actually using it. I think where a lot of leadership teams go wrong, especially of young companies, is they experiment with different vehicles to try this stuff. And then they either don't actually follow them or they throw them out the window after they haven't tried it for very long, and it creates a lot of chaos. So I would say do very few things consistently and try to do them well, and then see if they're working for you, and then once a year, maybe think about a revision. But don't keep throwing out new things you heard that other companies do. And it turns into a weird grab bag of operating stuff. You're nodding because you've seen this too lot.
Lenny (00:50:16):
Yeah, I think a problem I've seen is people think there's going to be this perfect system and process that's going to not have any flaws, and they're always like, "Oh, it's not perfect. We got to optimize it further." And what I find is it's always just like, this is the best one you can come up with at the time. This is the best idea you have now. There's going to be flaws. Just work around those flaws. But just know there's never going to be the one thing that works.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:50:35):
There is no one. There's no perfect org structure, there's no perfect operating approach, there's no perfect, yeah, performance and management and level system. But having one and committing to it is good. And don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Lenny (00:50:50):
There's another, you mentioned that I thought it'd be fun to talk about, that it's often chaotic at a company. I imagine people think about Stripe from the outset, like, oh, they've got it all figured out, so smooth, just runs like a machine. And I think people look at other successful companies and they're like, man, things are so crazy at our company. This isn't normal. But I think, you tell me if I'm wrong, most places are crazy and chaotic internally for a long time and often, right?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:51:15):
Yeah. There are different kinds of chaos, but it's so true. What is that? There's like a saying. Don't ever believe your best press or your worst press. It's never as bad as whatever someone's saying it is never as good. It's just normal is not pretty. It's a lot. And that is true. It's happening everywhere. I used to have a friend who was building a company. We would see each other. We both were from the Boston area, and it's a long story, but we'd end up on the same flight off in Rhode Island, coming back to Boston occasionally for stuff, for family. And we'd be in getting yelled at by the passengers because we'd be in the aisle of the airplane comparing notes about stuff that was broken.
(00:52:02):
And we had this expression, it was like, oh, and then I picked up the rock, and under that rock were some really ugly, creepy crawlies. But that's just like the way it is, is it's never perfect. But I guess I would go back to what I just said about having some stabilizing ways of doing things because that can create, I don't know, I'm not trying for a perception that the thing runs a machine, but more of a, that is a well run thing, right? And how do you create that perception? Because you adhere to some ways of running things and that are consistent, and it feels better even to the outside, even if there's a lot of chaotic stuff going on.
Lenny (00:52:45):
Coming back to the founding documents, could you just talk about what are in this group of founding documents? And I think even more interestingly, what's a sign that you should invest more time in this area as a startup?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:52:55):
Yeah. Very classic stuff is in here, nothing that you haven't seen or examples of. So one is I think it's good to have a mission. When I joined Stripe, we did not. It came to be apparent that to increase the GDP of the internet was probably the mission, because people kept repeating that back to us, and Patrick had written it on some website copy early on. But it was interesting that candidates and customers kind of grabbed it. It was very Stripe because it's a little bit intellectual and pointy headed and aspirational, but also it is... The GDP does involve economic progress, which we're all about, right? We're building infrastructure for commerce and payments for not just the internet actually. But anyway, point is have a mission, or at least the beginning of what's your one line of what you're seeking to accomplish.
(00:53:47):
And then I'm a big fan of writing sort of what we Stripe called our long-term goals, which were just not our short distance, but our longer distance, like why did we exist? And so the mission is one line, so you need a little more meat behind that, right? And actually, I think if you looked at our long-term goals, which by the way I thought would be a three to five year goal, I would say they're still relevant today. But one of Stripe's long term goals is to advance the state of the art and developer tools, which would not be something that everybody, especially every customer of would initially call out. But when you think about it... Lenny, you just did it. You think about it for a minute, you're like, yeah, the API and the docs and a lot of stuff that we've open sourced, Stripe cares.
(00:54:38):
Our forever user is fundamentally a developer. It's the person who's integrating Stripe, right? By the way, simple integration, complex integration, anywhere in between, we really care about their experience, and we care that the tools are excellent, because how are you going to increase the GDP of the internet if you don't advance the state of the art of developer tools? Right? Anyway, point is articulating that, because until I said that to you and I could talk about it with you and say you came to work at Stripe, you might not understand why we invested in certain things or why it meant so much to us in terms of our user experience and the mission. So articulate those things. And some of them might be a little bit aspirational, but they should feel at least real enough that you can have that conversation about... You look at anyone who works in a company, what they choose to do all day with their time should be guided by things like, what are we trying to accomplish?
(00:55:35):
What are our long-term goals? So if they don't know them, how are they going to make the right choices? So that's one. And then another is a lot of companies write company values, or at Stripe, we wrote operating principles. I think you had [inaudible 00:55:50] on, and she talked about these, and we even sort of took a version of ours and put them out for candidates so that they could evaluate, do I want to join this company, because I kind of want to know what it's like to work there? And I think that's really valuable to do because not every company is right for every candidate, and the more you can mutually match the better. But having some operating principles matters. I think you can go farther than that, but that's where I would sort of start, is those three things.
Lenny (00:56:17):
Awesome, I like the simplicity of this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:21):
How you know is people are asking you. Especially new hires are asking you a lot of questions about what's important, or "Why do we do it this way?" You said it yourself at the beginning. Doesn't writing something down, crystallize it? Time to write it down and crystallize it for everybody who works there.
Lenny (00:56:40):
And just to summarize you as a mission, your operating principle/values. What was the third one?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:45):
Yep. Long-term goals.
Lenny (00:56:47):
Long-term goals.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:48):
And sort of more details on why you exist. What are you really trying to accomplish?
Lenny (00:56:52):
Interesting. And then are those numbers in your experience, or is that a story of what [inaudible 00:56:57]?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:00):
Those are a little bit more, I think headlines. And I think your shorter term goals have numbers against them, right? So if you looked at your long-term goal, which might be... Another one of Stripe's is about accelerating globalization, and if you thought about what would that require, that would require us to be in a lot of markets. That would require us to have users and customers in a lot of market, and also to eliminate friction across borders. So those things, which is a very high friction thing, unfortunately in payments, and moving money, which it shouldn't be if you want to advance globalization, accelerate it, right? And so that can then become numerical goals and short term goals.
Lenny (00:57:41):
Basically objectives, and then-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:43):
Yeah, it's sort of the longer term objective, and then the key results part is early is shorter term. But actually, if you're having trouble writing your company goals, actually zooming way out and being like, "If we're going to meet this mission, what do we have to accomplish in the long term?" You can then walk back from that and be like, "Oh yeah, every goal we ever have probably fits in these three to five buckets." Bam. And then you write your short term goals actually more easily because there's always going to be one about, say, international expansion. There's always going to be one about additional products because we're trying to do X, and you can't do it with one product, or whatever. You can imagine the example.
Lenny (00:58:22):
Awesome. And I know your book has a actual examples of a lot of this stuff.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:25):
It does. It does.
Lenny (00:58:26):
So again, pointer to that. Okay, so that's the founding documents. The next piece is operating system. Maybe we go there, just what fits into an operating system for a company? What are the components of that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:38):
I think a lot of the components we've sort of touched on, which is do you have some sort of goals? This is now goes back what we were just talking about. For Stripe, we have an annual set of numeric targets that we put together, we have a system of goals or OKRs, objectives and key results, but sort of like what is your structure for setting milestones that you want to achieve, whether they're numeric or more like a binary, we got this thing launched, we didn't? And then QBR, so quarterly business reviews. How do we review parts of the business? What is the cadence? Well, first, what is the form by which we do that? Which would be this... I share examples in the book of this might be the template you fill out if you're a team and your reporting on how it's going and versus your strategy and your goal.
(00:59:24):
And then there's also getting into metrics and dashboards. What are things that you look at internally to measure progress, the input metrics and the output metrics? And I give some examples of that. And then mostly, I think there are other... As I said, there could be less frequent forms you use, like a user event or a launch, a way of launching products, et cetera, but it's really simple. It's mostly goals and how do you review the business. Planning. I talk a lot about planning, which is. You said this earlier, and you and I think both agree, which is there's no perfect process to plan for the next year or the next two years, but you still need to fight your way through having something, especially after a certain stage. And every COO I meet with, we sort of ring our hands together.
(01:00:11):
We're like, oh, planning and everyone hates us, too burdensome, but you still got to keep trying. You got to do it. And so we talk about planning processes and what they might look like and how you set them up. And then that's how you'd use goals and QBR to measure against the plan, right? So those are some of the operating systems. And then the cadence is just how often do you do these things? Actually, one of our big lessons, I think companies that are moving quickly and that are younger tend to resist some of the calendar based cadences of more mature companies because they seem slow. You're like, really? You're going to just achieve that goal in three months? Or are you artificially restricting yourself to some lowest common denominator of time? And so I get that fear, and I would say your cadence doesn't have to be one quarter or one six month, or even 12 months.
(01:01:08):
Stripe, we did sort of six month processes for a while. So instead of a year, we did it in six months. Still, there were things that took, by the way, a year or longer, but I think that play around with the timeframe and don't feel restricted by what other companies do. But one of our lessons on the QBR was sometimes those quarterly, because that stands for quarterly, those quarterly business reviews were too infrequent, especially for new product areas. They we're still in development. They were still getting a lot of feedback, launching a lot. And so we just said, okay, they're not quarterly anymore. They're like every six week business reviews. Fine, change your cadence. The point is to have one, because then it's predictable for teams. They know what they're marching toward, they know when they're going to be reporting out, and they can set their goals in a way that makes sense to make progress in that timeframe.
Lenny (01:02:02):
One quick question there. What's a sign that your cadence is off? What's a flag that we should go shorter or longer?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:02:10):
Well, everyone usually complains about these things, but I think if the... One, nothing, like you said, it's probably too fast if not enough progress is being made in between whatever your review or your reporting function is, and it's probably too slow if the content you're reviewing seems stale. And you're like, "Well, we knew this," or "We already did that thing," or "Yeah, we already had the meeting where we talked about that." That's another thing that's interesting, is some companies will have a pretty frequent metrics review cadence, and then an infrequent strategy review cadence. And what happens is the metrics review becomes the strategy review because you're not talking about the strategy often enough. And so you're talking about it through the data, and so then by the time you get to the strategy review, you're like, we already had this meeting. And that's just a sign that some things are just off. And to me, it's about timeliness and freshness of the content, but also that there's actually new content. If there's not new content, you're creating work for people. By the way, give them time to work.
(01:03:12):
And so I think don't fool yourself that thinking, having more frequent checks on things is going to actually make things run faster. I would say that the opposite can be true. And so be very wary of actually slowing velocity down by creating overhead. One thing we try to do at Stripe is if we're looking at metrics, let's just look at your dashboard live. Let's not create a special presentation. I actually just share your screen please on your dashboard, right? Which is a good discipline, because one, that means you have to have a really good dashboard that's real time, that's web accessible. No one had to pull or massage the data. That's a good sign. But it's also, you're not wasting people's time prepping all that information, which happened even... By the way, at Stripe, even when we put that in place, we still ended up with versions of that problem.
Lenny (01:04:04):
Yeah, [inaudible 01:04:05] I think mentioned that. I think there's a term for it, data something, where you randomly get chosen every week and someone has to present your data.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:04):
The metrics review meeting, yes.
Lenny (01:04:10):
And it's like the next day, you're going to have to share your meetings and [inaudible 01:04:12]
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:12):
Yes. We called it the spin the wheel, the spin wheel on who gets to present. But that has a logic in it, which is then you're not working. So just prepare it.
Lenny (01:04:26):
Right. That's awesome. I love that policy. There's so much more I want to chat about. There's chapters on hiring, self-development, personal development, all these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:34):
Team development. Yep.
Lenny (01:04:36):
What was that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:36):
There's a, yeah, intentional. There's a team building.
Lenny (01:04:40):
Team building.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:40):
And performance management.
Lenny (01:04:41):
Yeah. Okay, so we could go through all that stuff. Instead, I want to talk about the COO role broadly.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:47):
Yes.
Lenny (01:04:48):
I asked on Twitter, preparing for this chat, what people wanted me to ask you about it. And most of the questions ended up being about the COO role and things like that. So I just have a few questions lined up here for you.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:48):
Sure.
Lenny (01:04:58):
Okay. So Amir [inaudible 01:05:04], with little accent at the end there, he asked just at what point do companies need a COO, and how would you judge if someone is a fantastic COO?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:05:12):
Oh yeah. Well, I would first say most companies, if you looked at the universe of all companies, do not have a COO. I think it's fewer than 20%. It's definitely fewer than 30. And I think that's something to know, that I don't think it's an automatic role to have or hire. And I think you see it in more prevalently in earlier stage or high growth companies. You also, by the way, see it in certain business models. I actually think Apple was an interesting version of this, where Steve Jobs was oriented in terms of product and design, but also that Apple has... It's very intense to manufacture software and hardware that then works together. I learned that when I worked on self-driving cars at Google, and you need a very intensely operational, detailed manufacturing, hit the marks, hit the timelines person. So I think some businesses that have a very deeply operational, say a manufacturing component, that role might be more prevalent.
(01:06:19):
But point is, it's not an automatic. I think it's useful in a high growth... In an environment where you're having... Think about the founder/CEO of a company that is achieving product market fit and also having to build a company, and hire all the leaders. That is a lot because you are building the product and the business, you are building the company, and you are building all the people, bringing them all in. And that is where I think a COO type of role can give you leverage, which is... Essentially, it's a layer that takes some of those functions and helps build them with you and on your behalf, and also in some cases, bring some experience in maybe there's a particular function like go to market that needs to be built. And I think that's where you see it come up. What I've said to some people recently is I'm a little worried, just like there's a mythical founder, that there's some mythical silver bullet COO hire that everyone's like, "I will just find that person."
(01:07:20):
And first of all, we're all human beings. I'm not perfect. I certainly did some things well when I joined Stripe, and other things not as well, and I'm working on my self-awareness of what those things are. But I would say one lower risk strategy could be to bring in, say, a head of business operations or a role that's sort of COO like and try a couple of functions with someone and see if they scale with the company and with the role, and then maybe you decide they're a COO. I mean, I mentioned Stripe's business operations team. You could hire a business ops leader and sort of say, "Hey, build this team to help be the Swiss Army knife to help scale the company, and then maybe that turns into more." Or there's some CFOs that are quite operational. They could take on more scope sometimes.
(01:08:11):
But I think there are other paths to getting that leverage, and there are also ways to de-risk the hire because you could end up searching forever, right? And I worry that it's become too much of a panacea in people's minds, like somehow they're going to find... And people will call me, and they'll be like, "I just need to find you." And I'm like, "One, I may not be right for your company, but two, that was a lot of work, and I think we actually, in the end, maybe got pretty lucky." How would you know someone is fantastic? Someone said something very smart to me, which was... I was in a meeting. It was me and Patrick. So Patrick is the co-founder and CEO of Stripe. And they said that having just the right amount of tension in our relationship was how you knew it was working for the company.
(01:09:03):
And it gave us both a little bit of pause, but we ended up having quite a good conversation after that meeting, which is there has to be mutual understanding and trust and an ability for Patrick to say, "Hey, can you go do this thing?" And then believing, I will do it at the level of quality and intensity and intentionality that he would like. But there also has to be some friction, where I would maybe say, "No, I'm not going to prioritize that. I don't think that's important for the company," or I'm going to give you feedback that I don't think we're doing this well, or he's giving me feedback. The customer experience is suffering. All your scale stuff is degrading this thing, right? So fantastic is not all hunky dory. Fantastic COO is just the right amount of friction intention with forward momentum and mutual trust, because then the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, right? That's what you're looking for.
Lenny (01:10:03):
I was actually going to say, I've worked with some founders, and they have this concept that they hire a COO, and they would just solve all these cultural issues they're having these relationship issues. And sounds like that's exactly what you're saying, is that that is not often the solution to some of these deeper issues.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:10:18):
Well, that would be the other problem, is actually believing... I was getting recruited, Lenny, and people would... Essentially, I felt like the founders were saying to me, "I'm going to give you all of the things I don't like doing as your job." And I was like, even if I'm by the way not qualify to do all those things, number one. And two is sometimes that list would be quite long, and that would make me nervous. I was like, "Do you really not running a company actually? Is that what's going on here?" And really, I think they weren't confronting elements of their work that needed to evolve and change. And what I loved about joining Stripe was... I think people also think, "I'm just going to hand all this stuff to this person and..." I'd love to say I took all this off of the Collisons plate, and Billy and John and the other people who were there at the time, and no, we actually were more collaboratively worked together, and I think it helped...
(01:11:18):
Well, one, you don't feel as isolated because you're in a team, but also there's more joint work than people realize, I think at least in the companies I'd like to work for.
Lenny (01:11:30):
For the final 10-ish minutes we have together, and you have to run-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:33):
Yes.
Lenny (01:11:34):
... I was thinking I could go through just a rapid fire set of tactical questions and see maybe one piece of advice you would share with someone that's maybe struggling with this thing.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:44):
Okay.
Lenny (01:11:45):
And the first is from a also Twitter person, Manuel [inaudible 01:11:52]. And he just had a question around, as you're scaling, keeping alignment strong is challenging. What would be something you'd recommend to someone that's scaling quickly and trying to keep people aligned?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:02):
Well, a lot of what we talked about, having common codified documents of what we believe in, how we work, and then using communication practices very intelligently. Never think that one communication, meaning an email or an all hands, reaches the audience. You have to be smart about how you communicate.
Lenny (01:12:23):
Awesome. Amazing. On a different podcast, we talked about how the leaders are often the repeater in chief, just having to repeat the same thing again and again.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:30):
Yes. And just like a marketer, use different channels. Some people read emails, some people watch videos, some people attend the meeting. Repeat.
Lenny (01:12:40):
Love it. That'll be our clip to take away from this. I was watching an interview with you, and you talked about the value of offsites for creating cohesion within a team. Can you just talk about why offsites are so important to a company and a team?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:53):
I think offsite is really a vehicle. The concept is the following, which is when you yank people out of their day-to-day routine, you create space, and also you imprint memory. And so if you say, "We're going to do a very different thing with your time today or the next two days, we're not going to do our emails, we're not going to do our regular meetings, we are going to sit and work together, we're going to brainstorm," you're basically activating new parts of their brain, and then you're also having a group experience that cements a belief system usually, or a set of plans. And it also helps bring people along. We formed this thing together, it's not effective if I say, "I locked myself in a room for three hours, and then I came out and here's the plan." You want to lock yourselves as a group, as a team in a room for three hours. How do you do that? And so that's why I think it's valuable. It's just out of time, in a way. You're taking it out of your day-to-day time, and I can't not found a good substitute for that.
Lenny (01:13:56):
On a different topic, one of the most common questions I get from product managers and just founders that I haven't tackled yet, and I'm curious what your take is, is around just keeping the company updated on what's happening broadly.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:14:07):
Yes.
Lenny (01:14:07):
What have you found works for just keeping people informed on what's happening across the company and-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:14:12):
Having really smart communication practices is something that I think a lot of companies don't invest in early, and it's partly because it feels like extraneous, but it's a lot of time. If you're going to communicate well, you have to invest in your intranet site and what's on it. Ideally, everyone logs in and sees information on the homepage of your company internally. Do you have a newsletter? Do you have founders do like a message or a quick video, whether that's on Slack or email. There's a lot of smart tools. You can learn a lot from social media in some ways, but you actually need a strategy for it, and you need a set of people who help make sure it happens so that again, it creates stability and cadence. And if I want to find information about X, this is where I go. And I think there's also that if you do it well, it can replicate down to teams, which is, oh, we have our weekly snippet stock that everybody can see the important news or whatever it is.
(01:15:09):
But you need to create those things because they'll start to spring up, but then you'll have a million of them, and you won't be able to point people to the core messages. But it is not a thing to be taken lightly. And I think having someone who really not focuses on internal marketing, I'm talking about just good, "Here's what's important. Here's what you need to know." Sales teams actually do this really well, because they have to, because they have to keep the sellers up to date on the product and up to date on how to pitch it. And so it actually is worth talking to smart sort of sales leaders who've scaled and saying, what do you do that keeps everyone on the same page
Lenny (01:15:48):
As you're talking, I realized [inaudible 01:15:49], who we mentioned a couple times, she left Retool, and she's working at a startup that has trying to solve this problem, I think it's called. It
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:15:56):
Is a lot about what they're working on. And it's because it is, again, an unsung thing that is critical and that I don't think people naturally come to.
Lenny (01:16:03):
Next question, what are one to two, or maybe three things that people can do to run more effective meetings? I say give this masterclass on running more effective meetings. And just to boil down, what are a couple things people could probably change?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:16:16):
I do have a video on YouTube about running an effective meeting, but I think the number one thing is the work of a meeting is not calling the meeting. Calling a meeting is easy. In fact, that is a problem. The barrier is very low, and it should be higher. What you really want to know... People need to know why are we meeting, and what is the point, what's the objective of this meeting? Is it to make a decision? Is it to share information? Who needs to be here? One of my favorite things to say is make the thing that's implicit explicit. Too many meetings are implicitly about something and not explicit enough. And I'm like, "No, no, no. I want to know why I'm here. Are we making the decision? Who's making the decision? And how?" Even better, you say, "Does anyone not need to be here? Because we'll just send you a note afterwards about what happened? Right? Make it more efficient, but be really explicit about the point of the meeting, and really do some inquiry on whether it's important, whether it's needed.
Lenny (01:17:17):
Maybe a final question is around decision making. So product managers who are, a lot of the audience of this podcast, have to, one, make a lot of decisions, get people to alignment, but they also don't classically have authority over anyone. What advice do you have for aligning and decision making?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:34):
I love product management, so much accountability. So little authority. Such a hard job.
Lenny (01:17:39):
What a fun [inaudible 01:17:41].
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:41):
Everyone's like, "I want to be a product manager." I'm like, man, that is one of the hardest jobs in tech.
Lenny (01:17:45):
Yeah.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:46):
But anyway, how do you get people to a decision?
Lenny (01:17:48):
Yeah.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:50):
Actually, it's exactly... And I mentioned in my book, Gokul's SPADE Framework, which you can look up. He has a coda on it. But actually, it's the same thing that I said about meetings, which is making it very explicit, that there is a decision to be made, who is making the decision, the criteria by which the decision's going to be made, who will be informed. There's all these models. There's racy and radar, and there's a million different decision models. Just pick one, make it explicit, explain that's what's happening, and get people through it. Follow the model and do it. And by the way, you can always have an asterisk, which is if we want to revisit this decision, this is what we do. But I think too many teams get paralyzed because they're afraid, like, well, maybe they're not the decision maker, or maybe... When I say to people at Stripe in our onboarding, I used to run a session, I was like, if you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you, and I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to slow the whole company down.
(01:18:52):
But really, I think the other thing is, in the book, I talk about this framework that Bezos uses, type one, type two decisions. Is it high impact? Is it irreversible? Is it not? Really evaluate, what kind of decision is this? How hard is it? And then follow a process and get it done. And don't forget to actually make a decision. And if you don't know who the decision maker is and you're worried it's not you, just ask. Don't get stuck. Too many people get stuck, and it makes your work terrible, right? What do we all care about? Progress, impact, momentum. If anything I would say about advice to people generally is be a force for positive momentum, and it will be actually a real career maker.
Lenny (01:19:41):
I love that. Maybe we'll make that the title of this interview. With that, Claire, I know you have to run. Anyone listening, you got to buy this book. Like I've said at the beginning, if you like my newsletter, it's exactly my newsletter, but as a book about operations.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:19:54):
Thank you. Scaling People.
Lenny (01:19:56):
Scaling People. Is there a website they can go to to check it out on Amazon, or is there-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:00):
They can go to press.stripe.com/scaling-people.
Lenny (01:20:00):
Amazing.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:06):
Or Amazon. Just search scaling people on Amazon.
Lenny (01:20:08):
Cool.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:09):
But thank you, Lenny. I appreciate it.
Lenny (01:20:12):
Absolutely. Just two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to maybe ask you questions, follow up, reach out? And then two, any other way people can be helpful to you, other than maybe pre-ordering the book?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:20):
Well, definitely pre-ordering the book and giving me feedback on that. I guess Twitter is probably the best place to find me. I'm @chughesjohnson on Twitter. But honestly, I do hope you'll consume the book in some form and interact with it because the goal is to make it useful. We talked about this, Lenny, your podcast for my book is just trying to be of use, and I hope it is a positive force for positive momentum. And I really appreciate the opportunity.
Lenny (01:20:49):
Absolutely. Thanks for making time for this.

# Bending the universe in your favor | Claire Vo (LaunchDarkly, Color, Optimizely, ChatPRD)

## Transcript

Claire Vo (00:00:00):
People often think that I get hired into later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company, and in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup.

Lenny (00:00:11):
Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:00:16):
I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster. If you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half.

Lenny (00:00:24):
There may be a trend happening here of combining engineering product.

Claire Vo (00:00:27):
I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design speed. What is best for the organization?

Lenny (00:00:38):
You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there.

Claire Vo (00:00:44):
Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably.

Lenny (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Claire Vo. Claire is a longtime chief product officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. She's also been a two-time founder, engineer, designer, and a marketer. She's also the creator of ChatPRD, which I suspect is the most used PM-specific AI product out there, which she builds on nights and weekends.

(00:01:19):
In our conversation, we dig into what PM skills AI will complement and potentially replace in the future, the story behind ChatPRD, and Claire's advice for how to stay ahead of the curve on AI within the PM role, the importance of feeling agency over your career, and how to bend the arc of the universe to achieve the things that you want to achieve, insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an exec, how she creates a fast pace within larger companies while also keeping the bar very high, the rise of the CPTO role, combining product and engineering under one leader plus a ton of career advice both for early career people and senior leaders, and so much more.

(00:02:01):

This episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights hub for product teams. Are you working in a feature factory building filler that nobody wants? Probably, because the sad truth is that most SaaS features are rarely or never used, costing the industry billions every year. Let's change that. Product managers, Dovetail is holding their first industry conference, it's called Insight Out, and they want you to come.

(00:03:34):
Over one day in San Francisco, the product community is coming together to learn how to better leverage customer insights and build products that people actually love to use. It's on April 11, and you can hear from product leaders from Uber, Twitch, Meta, and Netflix as they share their strategies for driving innovation, thriving in uncertainty, and balancing customer-centered work with business needs. And here's the kicker, it's absolutely free for online tickets. Just go to dovetail.com/lenny to register. This is thanks to Dovetail, the best way for product teams to get the most out of customer insights. Check it out at dovetail.com/lenny.

(00:04:16):
Claire, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Claire Vo (00:04:20):
Oh, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I'm even more excited. You're someone that, to me, has always felt inevitable would be on this podcast and that we'd be doing an episode together. Do you feel the same way, or not? And it's okay if you don't.

Claire Vo (00:04:32):
It's a privilege and a pleasure, and I'm glad I'm here. I've been so impressed with your guests and your content. It's been so exciting to see just the wide range of product leaders and thinkers in this space. And if I can be on a list of product leaders and thinkers in this space, then I'm doing something good. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:51):
It's absolutely my pleasure.

(00:04:53):
I want to start by talking about career advice. I was perusing your LinkedIn, and your career path is basically what most PMs probably dream of in their career. Just to summarize, you went from associate product manager to product manager to senior product manager to director to senior director to VP to SVP to chief product officer, and now you've been chief product officer of three different companies. And along the way, you're a founder, you're a designer, you're an engineer.

(00:05:22):
Here's my question. If you had to boil down what you think your secret sauce has been to progressing so far and so quickly throughout your PM career, what might that be?

Claire Vo (00:05:33):
Yeah, so when you list it all out, you can probably guess underneath it all is a relentlessly curious, impatient, eager to build person at their core. I just like building stuff and I find a lot of fun, and I think if you find a career or a craft that's fun, it's easy to accelerate your growth in that career. One thing, I just love what I do.

(00:05:56):
But when it comes to career growth and that progression from, I actually started as a copywriter of all things, copywriter all the way up to a CPO or CPTO that runs an engineering organization, it boils down to something really simple, which is know what you want out of your career, be clear and ask for it, and then make it easy for your boss or whoever can support or champion you to get you from here to there.

(00:06:20):
And so I'll take a really specific example from earlier in my career, where I had been in management for design and product management, so a senior manager level over product and design at an e-commerce company, and worked very closely with growth and marketing. We were just two sides of the same coin and worked very closely. And the head of marketing left and there was this big to-do pretty quickly of, "Well, what are we going to do with marketing? And do we need to hire somebody?"

(00:06:49):
And I sat for about a half a day and I thought, I think I can help here, drew out an org chart, put my name on the top, walked into my boss's office and said, "This is one potential solve of your marketing organization question, is we'll bring product and marketing growth together. I can be in this position. Here's how I'd change the management structure underneath this. Not just where do you put me, but where do you put everybody else? And I think this could work for the company, and this is how I'd suggest we roll it out and this would be my JD." And I got that job. I think when people ask me about career advice, they want to hear, "What can I do?" Really, what do you want? And how do you make it as easy as possible to make the case to your boss to get you here to there?

(00:07:33):
The other thing that I give people advice about is know what you want out of your current role and know exactly what you want your next role to be. And I even know this, and I even say this to my boss. When I was VP of product at Optimizely, I said to my boss, "I want to be a chief product officer. Here's how I'm going to get us here to there, and I want you to partner with me on it." And even coming into this role when I was interviewing at LaunchDarkly, my boss, Dan, the CEO of LaunchDarkly asked me, "What do you want out of this role?" And I said, "I want my next role to be a CEO role, so I want this role to fill in my gaps, learn, help me elevate my experience to get me to that next step."

(00:08:14):
And so I always know what that next role is going to be and I'm always clear about it. Now, I think there's a fine balance here. There's one thing to be very clear about your goals. It's another to suck the oxygen out of the air about only talking about getting promoted. These are probably 0.005% of my interactions with my boss are about my career growth and my path. It's very small. "Am I clear? Are we on the same page? And am I communicating as I'm making progress against those goals?"

(00:08:44):
High-slip people I think get promoted basically as fast as the org can support. I've almost never wished I promoted somebody earlier. I've seen managers or folks promote a little too early, and so as somebody that's managing their own career, you have to be a balance of ambitious and assertive and take care of yourself and advocate for yourself, and the work needs to speak for itself at the end of the day, and that's what's going to drive for your career growth. And so know what you want but do the work and produce the results, and you can have a career like mine.

Lenny (00:09:24):
Maybe first to summarize, some of the core advice you're sharing is know what you actually want because you're not going to progress towards this amazing future career if you don't actually know where you're going. Otherwise, you'll be pushed in directions that you're not necessarily interested in going.

(00:09:38):
I have a sense of where you want to go to tell people and ask for it. "Here's what I want to be doing in the future. Help me get there." And I love the other point you made of just, don't over-focus on that. There's many people that spend a lot of their energy on, "I need to get promoted. How do I get to the next level? I deserve the next level." And I guess maybe along those lines, is there any other advice you could share of just how to avoid being that person that's just constantly obsessed with promotion? Any more advice of just how to find that balance?

Claire Vo (00:10:06):
Yeah. One, you've got to lock to the norms, the talent norms of your organization. You should know how those things work, and they can work very casually if you're a very small startup and they can work more formally if you're at a very large company. And one, understanding how promotions operationally happen inside an organization can help you have those conversations at the right time in the right moment with the right context. That's one thing I advise. We're a slightly larger organization. We do promotion cycles. We have times during which we promote people. And so if you're talking to me four months before a promo cycle, maybe it's top of mind, maybe it's not. I sometimes functionally cannot promote people inside larger organizations whenever I want.

(00:10:52):
One is, I think, understanding the talent calendar of your team, especially at a larger organization. I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, "I want to be promoted because I want to be a director of PM, because I want to become a manager, because I need direct reports." Instead of saying, "Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here. I have a lot of credibility with this side of the product organization. I think we could be doing more if this position existed. And I think I'm good for this position because of what I've proven A, B and C."

(00:11:43):
That's solving a problem for the company. That's not solving a career growth issue for an individual. And I think people who want to be promoted need to think in that orientation versus the other, because honestly, especially now, let's say [inaudible 00:12:01]. There are not just these wrote every 12 months we're going to give comp increases and merit increases and you get to be promoted. We really have to be thoughtful about the structure and size and organization of teams. Product teams are naturally pretty small.

(00:12:19):
So, there aren't just management and director and senior director roles to go around. And if you want to get into a management, for example, you have to prove that you're good at organization design. I think really focus on why a role is good for a company or necessary for a company and then why you are the best for that role, rather than, "I want to get promoted."

Lenny (00:12:41):
That is such good advice and such important advice that focus on how do you solve problems for your manager and the business, not, "Hey, here's what I need for my career. This sucks. My career is stagnating." I love that. And I love so much of your message is empowerment. It's not just, here, there's the place you're in and there's not a lot you can do about it. Look for opportunities to help your manager, help your business. "Here's what I can do to move things further."

(00:13:06):
And I think there's an element of timing that you touched on. Propose this at a time when something could happen. You shared this example of there was a marketing gap.

Claire Vo (00:13:15):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:13:17):
Is there another example where you did this sort of thing where you presented, "Here's how I can help the org," and that helped another promotion? If not, that's good.

Claire Vo (00:13:25):
It's honestly how I expanded into leading engineering teams in the technology organization. I was at Color and there was a real need to up-level our engineering organization, and I knew exactly what to do. I had high confidence I had the skills, both technical and organizational, to scale the engineering organization in a way that was really critical to the business, both from a architecture perspective and from a team and talent perspective. And so that was one where I knew there was a problem to solve. I knew that problem was important. I knew we had to solve it fast, and I was confident I knew I could do it. I had confidence that I could help there.

(00:14:06):
And so I'm still doing it today. And at Color, I came in as product. I very quickly began leading the engineering organization, which was fabulous, and then I actually took on some of our non-clinical operations as well where we had a pretty operational leader. We had some high-scale challenges to deal with, and it fit my talent set and I knew I could help the company pretty quickly.

(00:14:32):
And this is the other advice I might give particular to PMs. PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role. That was actually my first director role. It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing and I had to develop skills there, but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career. And so I do think also looking left and right outside of your scope of product can be a really effective way to find growth opportunities.

Lenny (00:15:08):
I love that advice, and it leads to so many unexpected opportunities. One of the, I think, big questions with PMs, and coming back to your original advice of know where you want to go, there's so many directions a PM can go. You can eventually become a founder, become a GM, become a CO, something else. And trying these sorts of things often helps you understand, "Here's what I'm actually excited about. Maybe I want to move into design."

Claire Vo (00:15:31):
Yeah, and one of the other things that I think people don't understand, and maybe I experienced this as a founder and I really feel it inside companies, is the universe is bendable to your will. And what I mean is in most, at least in the stage I operate in in startups and growth stage companies and late stage startups, organizations are very fluid and I like to organize around talented motivated individuals.

(00:15:58):
And so just because we're organized in a particular way now, just because these organizations are separate or these are different, together, doesn't mean that's necessarily the way they have to be, and so you should think about your career growth in the existing structure of the organization. But as an org design thinker, it's a very important job that I have to do. You also have to think of this system as a living, breathing entity that can shift over time in particular around highly motivated, highly talented people.

Lenny (00:16:30):
And I think along the same lines, referencing this advice you've already shared of just thinking from the perspective of what is my manager and folks above, what are they struggling with and how can I propose, "Here's a solution that happens to also have me move into a more interesting role?"

Claire Vo (00:16:46):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:16:48):
There's a direction I wasn't planning to go into, but I think it's really important and interesting is people like you that are incredibly good and successful end up taking on a lot, and that often ends up not being what they want.

Claire Vo (00:16:58):
SOS.

Lenny (00:17:00):
Exactly. Any advice on the classic, be careful what you're good at advice? Any advice on just how to not end up with everything?

Claire Vo (00:17:08):
I really believe operating in your zone of genius. I really believe in leaning into strengths. And if you are in a position in which you're good at things and you've been giving a lot of responsibility, but you have tremendous growth edges and you're spending more time on the things you need to level up than the things you are exceptional at, I think that's not fair for the organization. I think that's not fair for you.

(00:17:32):
I truly believe defining and understanding your zone of genius, where you are exceptional, where no one else can step into the job and do just as good of a job as you can, and where you derive tremendous intellectual emotional joy out of the work is what makes it sustainable over time. And so I don't actually think it's about the volume or breadth of the work. It's about sustainability of the work. And can you show up every day energized and engaged and excited about what you do?

(00:18:04):
And I think being very aware if you are operating the space or if you're not. And this might go back to, I think, I have never regretted promoting somebody too slowly, I have regretted promoting somebody too quickly. High-slope individuals in particular areas want to get more responsibility, want to have more scope, and I've seen less experienced managers or directors or even people at my level want to give opportunities that put people in a position where they're neither effective nor happy. And so I think being self-aware of that is really important, and then I also think as a manager, being cognizant of that is really important.

(00:18:50):
Individually, I do do a lot, but I do feel like I'm in my zone of genius and I also know that part of staying in my personal zone of genius is having this breadth of responsibility but preserving builder time. And what I mean from time is I have to have time to produce real work that comes from me as an individual, and that means that calendar management is quite important. Time management.

Lenny (00:19:21):
We're going to talk about some of the things that you built.

(00:19:23):
In terms of finding your zone of genius, any advice for someone that's trying to figure out what it is that is in that zone of genius? I know there's a Ted Talk of here's how to think about the zone of genius specifically [inaudible 00:19:33].

Claire Vo (00:19:32):
Yeah. I'm not going to relay it in precision, but one of the tactics that I've seen out there is basically go through your calendar for the last month or quarter, whatever it is, write everything down, and basically group them into, I hated doing this, I didn't love doing it but it was fine, I love doing this, and then I love doing this, and if I could spend all my time on this, I would be the happiest person in the whole world. And literally categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, "How can I be here more?" And often, that is a true guide to where your passion is, where your special expertise is, and where you're going to add a lot of value because you're highly engaged.

(00:20:26):
I think the other thing is really asking yourself, and this maybe goes back to the career advice perspective, really asking yourself, "What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?" There are lots of things that I do that other people in the organization can do, but what are the things that I do that are... You think about a differentiated product that are hard to replicate, and knowing what that is and leaning into that can drive a lot of exceptional career growth but also just make you quite happy.

Lenny (00:20:58):
What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:21:00):
I think I'm actually quite good at traversing across and up and down. What I mean is I am fluent across product engineering, design, data and operations, and candidly revenue in a way that vertical or functional leaders maybe are less so. I feel like I have a high level of fluency broadly and can bring conversations between functions together against a business objective pretty easily. It's just the way I'm wired. I was a founder. It's second nature.

(00:21:31):
And the other thing that I think I can do pretty well that I find very joyous is traverse elevation. And so, yes, I love to be up here and think about strategy and vision, but I also like to drop into the details to move things forward. And I think that operating horizontally and then being able to spend some time in the vertical up and down, wherever that vertical up and down happens makes me quite happy. I think I'm pretty good at it.

Lenny (00:21:58):
Amazing. We're going to touch on some of these things you just mentioned actually, but real quick, you mentioned this idea of essentially an energy audit. There's actually a really good guide that I'll point to in the show notes by Matt Mochary that walks you through how to do this. And we talk about this a bunch on this podcast actually, this whole idea of just find things that give you energy, do more of that. Find things that zap you of energy, do less of that. Easier said than done when you have a job and you have to do stuff that people are paying you to do, but it's still really helpful if nothing else to help you point you where you want to be going in your career long-term.

(00:22:29):
Okay, so you mentioned you're a founder, and it feels like you're a founder at heart, but you've been working at larger companies for a while now. And I hear that you're really good at setting a fast pace within larger companies and maintaining that startup focus while also having a very high bar for quality and product. Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." Why would we not want that? I'm curious just what you actually put into practice concretely that allow for you to build teams that move really fast and maintain a high bar. Are there processes you find helpful, values, ways of working?

Claire Vo (00:23:06):
Yeah, it's really funny, people often think that I get hired into the roles that I get hired into in later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup. And so I think about it completely differently.

(00:23:23):
And there are two things I think about in terms of pace and high bar. From a pace, it's know what your internal pace is, and essentially don't let it degrade to the pace of your recurring meetings. I often find that pace of organization locks to pace of the calendar, and so I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, "Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting," it's, "No, we should discuss this now. We should decide this tomorrow."

(00:23:58):
The other thing that I think about is setting one click faster pace expectations inside an organization. I tend to come in and love this, hate it, it's what I do, which is if I look at an organization that is operating at a lower pace than I would expect, I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster, which means if you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half. If you think it needs to be done this half, it needs to be done this quarter. This quarter, this month. This week, today. End of day, in this meeting. And actually setting an expectation that your natural pace is going to be slower than your ambition and being explicit about pulling things in I think can change the way expectations are set and honestly change the energy and momentum in the organization.

(00:24:51):
The third thing on pace is personal SLA. I never want to be a bottleneck for the organization. This is one of the more challenging things about being in my role, is you are often a point of decision-making, tie-breaking, next steps, approvals, socialization. And if my personal SLA is slow, then the rest of my organization cannot be as fast as possible. I try to be fairly responsive. I try to say, "Do both very high rate," and also very quickly. It's really hard, sometimes it's not totally possible, but it's a goal I have.

Lenny (00:25:27):
I love this clock speed concept of just let's move one iteration faster than we would normally move. How do you actually do that? Is this just you doing it and then everyone trickles down from the way you're approaching it? Is this a principle on a team? Is there a phrase you use?

Claire Vo (00:25:41):
Yeah, it's a phrase I use and something I asked our leadership teams to do. It started at, one, I'm going to do this, and two, my expectation is you look for opportunities to do this. And the reason I think this is effective, it's very tangible and it's very tactical. It just is one of those things that a moment when you're about to say a due date, you check yourself and you go, "Is this right or do I need to pull it in by an iteration?" And so it's a very tactical piece of advice and expectation I give to my leadership team. If they can show up that way, then the expected pace of the organization goes up, and then people tend to rise to the occasion.

Lenny (00:26:26):
And then it connects very directly to your first piece of advice, is not rely on the meeting cadence to determine your action cadence. I imagine that's a similar situation where you tell people, "Here's how I want to operate," and then you actually work that way and that starts to filter through.

Claire Vo (00:26:41):
Yeah, I just think there's this anti-pattern of, "We'll make the decision in the next meeting," or, "We'll follow up on this in the next meeting." That is an artificial timeline introduced by Google Calendar or whatever calendar you use. It's not a real thing, and so I want to put us on real timelines. When can we make the decision? How much information do we need? And that doesn't mean that every decision is made now, today, tomorrow, but it does mean we don't snap to artificial cadences to make our product move forward.

Lenny (00:27:12):
Awesome. Let's talk about quality. What are some lessons there?

Claire Vo (00:27:17):
Yeah, I think in terms of high bar, there's probably two things that I think about as a leader. There's the talent bar being exceptionally high, and then there's the product bar being high.

(00:27:28):
I'll start with talent, which is, on the talent side I think you have to define the bar. You have to be really specific, and that means you have to think about pretty deeply what are your leadership principles? If your leadership principle is bring the clock speed up one iteration, be explicit that that's what you expect to see, and then articulate that and hold people accountable to it.

(00:27:51):
And so I do think it's really important to have a specific and measurable career ladder, especially at the senior levels. I often find that they're very soft. They're hires and manages multiple departments or takes in cross-functional stakeholder feedback. Those are just not tractable, specific things. And so I think, PMs, put on your product definition or OKR hat or whatever and define some real goals for these levels and be specific in a way that you can look at people and say, definitively, "Yes. Measurably, yes, they're meaning this bar measurably. No, they're not meeting that bar." And so I think that's very important.

(00:28:39):
The second thing I think is you have to normalize feedback. And Brené Brown, fellow Texan, love her, "Clear is kind," I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar. They just do, because the expectations are not stated and you're not holding accountability. And I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers. That is not helping them become the best teammate that they can become.

(00:29:08):
I really like to normalize feedback and, as I say, take the temperature out of the room when it comes to open and candid feedback. And that means being very clear when people are not meeting expectations, making it very clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent. And I think that has something that people need to hear to normalize feedback. But I think feedback is quite important.

(00:29:30):
And I think the third thing is unfortunately when you're working to build a high talent bar and high talent density, then when folks aren't a fit and it's not working, moving against that quickly is part of the job. And it's a hard part of the job and it's part of the job that most managers really avoid, but I think it's important because it keeps your overall team operating in a really healthy, effective, performant way that makes everybody happier, including people that probably weren't a great fit for the work of the role at the time.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Is there an example of you being surprisingly candid to someone or giving feedback, hard feedback, to someone about quality, something that's just like, "Oh wow, that's what I should be doing?"

Claire Vo (00:30:16):
There were two leaders in my organization, I won't say which ones and I won't say when, but two leaders in the organization, partners across product and engineering, and they could not get it together. They could not work together. They were having misalignments and priorities strategy. They could not communicate. They were having conflict in front of the team.

(00:30:38):
And the managers that had managed them were taking this very soft pedal approach of, "You need to work on your [inaudible 00:30:47] functional stakeholder, and here am I expecting all this performance management stuff to happen." And I called both of them individually and I said, "The way you are operating is not meeting our leadership expectations. If you do not change, you cannot be part of this organization anymore. I believe you can operate differently. I do." And I did. I believe these are very talented people who could operate. "I believe you can operate differently, but it is your responsibility to do so, and I need to see change starting tomorrow."

(00:31:20):
I wanted them to succeed. And in fact, they did. It snapped in, they got it, and one of the... Turned into one of the most influential effective managers in our team over the course of probably the next six to nine months. And I think just clearly saying, "You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path. I believe you can get here, but it is your responsibility." That is the conversation that is clear and kind and honestly very effective in most instances.

Lenny (00:31:55):
That's an amazing example. Clear is kind, as you said. It reminds me of Kim Scott, who's on the podcast, shared this story about Bob. I don't know if you remember that story at all of just this guy at their company who was just doing a bad job and everyone knew he was doing a bad job, and then they had to fire him. When they're firing him, he's just like, "Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone tell me that nobody thought I was doing a great job?"

Claire Vo (00:32:16):
And I honestly think saying, "You are not doing a good job," is much kinder than, "I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect." Or, "I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at..." That's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else.

Lenny (00:32:36):
Okay, let's go in a different direction. Let's talk about being a woman in tech.

Claire Vo (00:32:40):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:32:41):
This doesn't get talked about a ton on podcasts like this. I know you have a lot of thoughts. Obviously, you've been through a lot. You've had a lot of experiences. There's probably a lot of stories you haven't shared in other places, so I just want to give you a chance to share what you've been through, what you've seen, and any advice you may have.

Claire Vo (00:32:58):
Yeah, and I'm happy to talk about this. I know a lot of people don't want to be defined or consistently asked about being a woman or a mom in a C-level leadership role. Let's not have women in tech panels anymore. But I've been reflecting a bit on this lately because I just came from a few years in healthcare, which, from my experience, it's a lot more women in leadership roles. I was a little spoiled, even in our technology organization. And now, I'm back in startups and tech, where the ratios are completely opposite, especially in roles like engineering, which is a team that I run.

(00:33:30):
And look, this is just, it's math. I think Carta said that 13-something percent of founders last year were women. It's declining year over year. FEMA led founded teams, or at least 2% of venture capital, women hold 30% of senior leadership org roles. Women are 30% of software engineering teams. This is just math. We're just facts. We're not in the room in the equal proportions. And as somebody who has, despite the numbers, had a fairly successful career so far in technology, I feel like I owe it to the industry to say it hasn't been easy and it's still not easy, even at my level.

(00:34:09):
And what I want to be clear about, because it gets talked about a lot in forms like this, this is not about imposter syndrome. How could I have any right to imposter syndrome? I've proven myself. I've been a founder, I've raised venture capital, I've had a successful exit. I've been, as you said, a CPO across increasing large teams. I get to invest in red companies. I'm on boards. I get to be on this podcast. I'm a TikTok influencer. This is not about feeling like an imposter. It's really about, it is hard and it is different, and the numbers pencil out in a way that is not favorable to women.

(00:34:47):
And as you said, there's been a lot of stuff in the past that you look at me now and you say, "Oh, she did associate and all the way up," but I had to fight for my all-girls school to carry computer science at the same rate that the all-boys school had it naturally. I grew up in teeny tiny startups in the early aughts. I saw some nonsense. I had VCs tell me, "Don't get pregnant," when I was... These things happened. And yet here I am, and it's fine.

(00:35:21):
And I'm not complaining. I just think what people also don't understand is that stuff still happens. I don't need to litigate who it happens with, where it happens. It still happens. I have arrived and it still happens. And the reason I bring this up is I think it should be a point of reflection for industry, and I think it can be a really effective point of reflection for women who want to get into leadership roles.

(00:35:46):
And the way I approach it is I'm just very curious. I wonder what is structural about technology that creates these things happen? What is cultural? What is external? What has happened to me or happens around me? What is internal? What do I bring into the room that doesn't serve me? And so I try to stay very curious. And then constant product thinker, what are the points of leverage I can use to move things not just forward for me, but for the industry broadly? How can I influence thinking? Where can I not? Where can I walk away from things?

(00:36:24):
And then as for the internal aspect of it, I think this is also a very powerful thing, which is I try to stay in an empowered space. I know my value. I have no time for imposter syndrome. It's not a constructive thing for me, but I do think knowing that, as I said earlier, the universe is bendable to your will. There are things we can change. I don't think these numbers are not tractable. And so my recommendation and what I'd love to say to the industry generally, to women in particular, is curiosity and empowerment have been my path to joy in this sometimes complicated industry. And I think there's a lot better we can do. There's a little bit of ways to go.

Lenny (00:37:10):
Is there a story that you could share if you're comfortable of just something you've gone through or been through that maybe people are like, "Oh, wow, I see what stuff she's dealing with or other women are dealing with that I had no sense of?"

Claire Vo (00:37:21):
I've been trying to wrap my head around this one, which is I consistently get asked if I'm technical enough. Not even if I'm technical enough. Let's put enough aside. If I'm technical. And it's fascinating to me because as a technical co-founder of my startup, I wrote code for the first 12 months solo. I led the engineering team there. That code is still in production in very large environments. I have run multi-hundred people, engineering teams for many years, and I spend my Saturdays and Sundays shipping code. This is what I do. And truly, the first question most people ask me is, "Oh, well you're not technical though. You're a product person."

(00:38:11):
And I've been really trying to unpack where that is coming from. It's hard for me to imagine somebody else that looks different, that has a different name, that has a different gender getting that question with my background. And so that's one of those things that has really been spinning my head. Again, it's not about imposter syndrome. I don't have anything to prove to people, but I am quite curious where that orientation comes from. And if it comes to somebody like me, who has really had some proven success, I know it's happening to other people, and I'm hoping that I can do something from my position to turn that a little bit.

Lenny (00:38:50):
And this connects to what you shared, the advice you had of just try to get curious about why it's happening, which is exactly what you just said. Is that just mostly to help you not get upset and frustrated? Let me just understand, why is this happening again and again?

Claire Vo (00:39:02):
One, I do think sitting in your power is very effective. And so curiosity means that I'm in control, and I do think I'm in control more than I'm not. That's one part of it is, I think. And the other thing is I think a lot of this is it's complicated. It's structural, it's cultural. It's what you see and what you don't see, not just in the workplace. It's what you see and don't see in media. Am I reading my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old books of, "My grandma's a software engineer?"

(00:39:35):
Books called the Mom Test, which I actually think is a great book, but it has this underlying presumption of who is technical, who's not, who understands things, who doesn't. And that all bubbles up into how individuals experience an industry that's driving tremendous economic growth here, where at the end of the day, it's about economic participation. It can be about individuals and aspirations, but it is also about economic participation.

(00:40:00):
The reason I'm curious about it is I do think it's complicated and I do think you can be successful, but I don't think we're being successful at the rates I would love to see. And I think we're missing a lot of innovation and a lot of economic growth by not having incredible, technical, capable women start companies and lead organizations. And so I think we're all missing out for that, and I'd love to see more of it.

Lenny (00:40:25):
And is there an answer to how do we do this better? Anything you think, hey, you've seen work to help get us past this?

Claire Vo (00:40:34):
I think normalize seeing it, so thanks for bringing me on this podcast, but I do think normalize seeing it is one of the simplest ways. If you close your eyes and imagine a software engineer, my dream is you imagine a diverse set of folks. You don't imagine a very specific art type. And so I do think you can't believe it unless you see it, and so the more that you can provide platforms for diverse voices to talk about their journey in technology, expose that there are leaders out there that come from different backgrounds, technically, culturally, all those things, the more the industry can imagine different types of leaders in different types of roles.

(00:41:17):
And so I just want to see it more. I want to invest more and raise the voices of female founders. I want to call out their amazing female CTOs out there, all those things. And I think if you can see it, you can start to unlock these very embedded concepts of who is and is not a technology leader who is and is not technical.

Lenny (00:41:40):
Awesome. I love that advice. It's something I try really hard to do with this podcast.

(00:42:36):
I know you have a fun story about when you were very pregnant selling your startup to Optimizely. Can you share that story? I haven't actually heard the story.

Claire Vo (00:42:45):
Yeah, this was a fun one. Again, this is the universe is bendable to your will and lean into your power, which is, I had been running Experiment Engine, which was a platform for enterprises to run high scale experimentation programs. Not necessarily the underlying A/B testing technology, but all the stuff around hypothesis gathering, insights, aggregation, operations, keeping things on track. Because I really know, as you do, that high scale experimentation programs can be very impactful to businesses.

(00:43:19):
That being said, it was like a niche inside in industry, as opposed to a large TAM problem. And so I think we just fundamentally hit a TAM ceiling here. We had a great product for a great market that was very narrow. And three years, four years into running the company, I knew that to be true and I knew that we would be better served by being part of a larger organization, and one of those organizations could be a large testing company. And so I remember that was noodling on my mind, but we were also really trying to sell to enterprises.

(00:43:52):
And I heard that Microsoft, who was one of our biggest customers, was doing a experimentation day with Optimizely, and I knew Optimizely was a natural acquirer. And I knew I had to get into that room, so I called Microsoft and I said, "Hey, friend of Microsoft, I'm going to be up in Seattle seeing our other customer, very large Seattle company, this week, week of experimentation day. Could we stop by?" And they're like, "Oh yeah, sure." Well, then I went to other big Seattle companies and said, "Hey, other big Seattle company, I'm going to be up Microsoft at their experimentation day. Would you be..."

(00:44:34):
I got these two meetings to manifest against each other, and then I walked into that experimentation day and I eyeballed the CFO of Optimizely and I sat in front of him and started pulling up the product and coding at the same time. I was just like, "I'm going to sit in front of him in the row and I'm going to do this and we're going to have my screens." And then I went up and did a demo. And I'm not saying that's the thing that made it happen, but I will say very quickly after that, we became very close partners and ultimately they acquired me.

(00:45:06):
And I give this advice to founders because one of the things that, and founders and PMs, one of the things that I really hire for is scrappiness. I think you have to be able to do a lot with a little, and I think you have to know where you're getting and, come hell or high water, figure out a way to get there. And this was a very fun example of working my way into the right room, setting myself up for the success that I wanted, and having the backing, the good job, the great product, the outcomes to earn it. But you also have to get yourself in the room.

Lenny (00:45:39):
And how many months pregnant were you?

Claire Vo (00:45:44):
I was extremely pregnant. A ticking time bomb of a belly is a really good negotiation tactic in a deal. I think I remember when we were negotiating the final term sheet, I was 34 weeks pregnant, something like that, and they said, "Can you fly out to San Francisco?" I was in Austin at the time. And I said, "Literally, you can fly me out today and back tomorrow, and then I'm not allowed on planes." And that's how. It was very fun. It was fun, and what a happy acquisition. I can talk all day about how that was great. Great experience.

Lenny (00:46:11):
And I love it's another example of the phrase you've been coming back to of bending, I don't know if it's bending the world to your will.

Claire Vo (00:46:17):
Bending the universe towards your will.

Lenny (00:46:19):
The universe? Even bigger. I love it. It feels like a recurring theme here, is to take agency and control where your career and life is going. And that's such a good example of just finding a way into this room that would be very hard for someone to get into.

(00:46:33):
You've touched on the CTPO role that I haven't heard much about. And I know that this is a big topic for you, and I feel like there might be a trend happening here of combining engineering product. Can you just talk about this role and why you think it might be emerging?

Claire Vo (00:46:51):
Yeah, I get asked about it a lot because it's not super rare, but it's not super common either, and I think it could potentially be rising. And I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. It's very different. I've done both. It's very different than a pure product or a VP product role.

(00:47:13):
And so first, I talked a little bit about how I got into this role. I do think you have to be technical to do a role like this. I think a lot of people look at my professional background and think that I use my broad leadership skills and leverage of a great SVP to keep engineering team going. But no, actually I spent quite a bit of time on the engineering side, because as somebody who is responsible for the business outcomes of the product, one of the best ways to drive value is having a highly performant engineering team that works on a scalable platform.

(00:47:45):
And so I spend a lot of time making sure that we're building the right architectural decisions, that our infrastructure meets the needs of our team, that our edge team is operating in a way that drives velocity. And I just don't think you can do that job if you don't understand how software gets built on a technical level. So I'm the kind of person that when we're doing a product review, I have the PRD up and GitHub up and I'm comparing both, because I think both sides matter.

(00:48:10):
I think the other thing that's different about this role is it's quite operational, and so you really have to know about operations and organization design. Edge teams are by nature much larger than product organizations. You just think about the classic ratios, there are more people in engineering than there are in product. And the talent challenges are significantly different in engineering, whether it's the high volume of recruiting, culture-shaped challenges are different. You have to really think about org design. And so you have to have a different level of mindset around organization design and operations when you're in a CPTO role.

(00:48:51):
You're on pager duty. You're getting paged at 1:00 AM if a service, if there's a Sub-Zero and it goes down. That is not what it's like to be a product leader. So you got to know what you're getting into and you have to be technical. And then the thing I would be remiss to say about this role is the P and the T get a lot of air time. Product and engineering get a lot of air time. Design data, these are such functional, very important organizations, and why these roles get... That's what the role is and how you could be good at it or whether it would be a fit for your skills.

(00:49:24):
The question of why have this kind of role, and I think there's two reasons. There's the obvious strategic reason of, they're all the same thing. They're all building capital P product, they're all builders, they're the same types of folks, they're all builders, and bringing them under one house allows you to optimize for the whole, as opposed to optimize for the function. And if you can find a leader that is effective at that, I think you can get a lot of value added. And honestly, the second thing is it provides a tremendous amount of leverage to the CEO in many ways. At the end of the day, R&D is a very expensive and complicated investment the company is making, and having a single person responsible for R&D investment at the executive level is quite important, especially when you're candidly spending a lot there.

(00:50:21):
And so I think it's those two things. It's, these are one team. There should be be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design. It should be what is best for the organization at whole. What do our customers need and what do our business needs? And then it's the accountability candidly of this quite meaningful investment against business objectives and having a singularly responsible individual to care for that investment.

Lenny (00:50:46):
It sounds wonderful, having one person to deal with across all these functions.

Claire Vo (00:50:50):
It is and isn't. I'll just say, I've done both. I've been a CPO next to an SVP of Eng. I've run both together. Founders can play this role. And again, this is why I say you have to optimize around talent in your organization. If your CEO has the skills, bandwidth, et cetera, to do this, they can do this. You can keep the organization separate. They can hold that. If they have a different area of expertise, if they've never done that before, if it's just not working operationally, they have broader areas of focus, then bring it together under someone. I don't think there's a perfect organization structure. This has just been one that's worked well in the shape of organizations that need someone like me.

Lenny (00:51:33):
And along the same lines, designing an org around the person, I imagine there's not many very engineering background experience people that are also really good at product and can do design. I guess how deep do you need to be in each of these functions to be successful in this role? Because it feels really rare.

Claire Vo (00:51:51):
Start a company and then you have to do it, in some ways. I've worked for both and they've told me, I've worked for two, they go, "I'm not a founder, but I'm the CEO." And I go, "That's fine. I'm an operator, but I'm going to bring a founder mindset."

(00:52:08):
And so I think as a founder, especially early stage, you do all of this. You see how all of this is one person, because honestly sometimes it is one person, and sometimes that person is you. And so I do think working in a very small startup gives you the opportunity to experience a breadth of functional skills and develop a breadth of functional skills that can set you up for this kind of role much further down the line. I do think early stage startup experience is one of those shortcuts to getting visibility here.

(00:52:46):
I think the other thing is, again, I said this earlier, so many people get siloed into, "I'm a product manager, and so my job is this, but it's not that. And I can only do this, and if designs are needed, I am blocked and I will just wait." And I just give permission for people to make... We have a leadership principle inside our team that's like, "There are no lanes." Our lanes are dotted. They're not solid in that you can shift over and pencil out a design, an engineer can write a spec. All those things are fine. They're natural, they're normal, and I actually think they're quite healthy. And it's that kind of thinking that probably is going to breed the type of leaders that could do this type of role.

Lenny (00:53:29):
Awesome. It reminds me at GitLab. I just interviewed their head of product, or CPO, and they have a core value of, "Short toes." Don't worry about stepping on people's toes. Have short toes. Don't worry about people getting into your stuff. It's all good.

Claire Vo (00:53:43):
Yep.

Lenny (00:53:43):
Okay. You mentioned AI. Amazing segue to my next topic that I want to spend some time on. You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there, other than some big company's tool like, I don't know, Sprague or Figma or something like that. First of all, just what is ChatPRD, and then why did you build it?

Claire Vo (00:54:06):
Yeah. ChatPRD comes out of, again, pace setting. And I'll actually tell you the real genesis of ChatPRD, which is at a previous company we had a quite technical product we needed to build. We're scrappy and resource-constrained, and our platform PMs were working on something very important, but this was critical and we needed to get it done. And we didn't really have a platform technical PM to spec this thing out. And it was quite complicated.

(00:54:35):
And I raised my hand and I said, "I'll IC this. I think I know what we need." And between the beginning of the meeting and the end of the meeting, I had used ChatGPT and a prompt to come up with a very serviceable PRD spec for this very technical product. And I took that prompt and that long-running ChatGPT thread and crafted the Claire version of a product leader or product person that could, with really solid consistency, output product specs, give good feedback, build out plans, build out tracking mechanisms and goals.

(00:55:20):
And so while I say, "She may just be a prompt, but she is prompt," this was lovingly crafted over several months. And so when the GPT Store came out, for my team I just said, "Hey, you all know I've been writing PRDs with ChatGPT." I created a GPT and just gave it to my team. I was like, "Here, you can use this if you want it." And they really liked it, and other people started asking about it and I eventually ran into the monetization and access wall that is the GPT Store right now. And so I've also been having a lot of fun coding again, and so I thought, this is easy. We're just going to stand up a standalone app and wrap, come on, it's a wrapper, it started as wrapper, wrap some of these capabilities and just publish it and put a fairly reasonable price tag on it and see what happens.

(00:56:12):
And now, I have thousands of people using ChatPRD. Every day, people are creating dozens of specs and PRDs every month. It's everything from, "I'm an engineer on a team with too few PMs and I get blocked, so I'm going to build my own requirements," to, "I'm a solo founder and I need to put some structure on my thought for my team," to, "I'm a PM and this has saved me truly hours of work to get the basics of my product requirements done so I can spend time on the details." And then I've added on more functions and capabilities than the standalone app. It is my personal product copilot that I've released for the world.

Lenny (00:56:49):
Okay. First of all, where can people check this out? Is it chatprd.com?

Claire Vo (00:56:53):
.ai. Come on.

Lenny (00:56:54):
.ai, of course.

Claire Vo (00:56:54):
Yeah, chatprd.ai.

Lenny (00:56:58):
I saw some stuff about the country that has .ai is just making so much bank right now.

Claire Vo (00:57:01):
So much money.

Lenny (00:57:02):
All these domains.

(00:57:04):
Then in terms of the stack, just to be clear, so it started as a ChatGPT prompt, custom prompt, you evolved, then it became a GPT, a custom GPT, and now it's your own app that is using the OpenAI APIs behind-

Claire Vo (00:57:17):
It is, yeah. It's using the assistance APIs. And what's different about the standalone app versus the GPT is every person that uses the standalone app gets a customized assistant. It learns from their specific content. It learns from their role. It learns from their company. If you use the GPT version, you're not getting that customization. When you use the standalone app, you are getting that customization. And then I've layered on a couple of different capabilities. In addition to having the chat format, it will actually create the document for you and iterate on the actual doc for you, and then working on some additional tools and integrations in the future.

Lenny (00:57:55):
Okay, great. What are the most common use cases again? Just so people can get a sense of, "Oh, let me use this for these things."

Claire Vo (00:58:00):
Yeah, about 60% of people use it to put in an idea and get a PRD out. Just get the specs of what are my objectives and user goals, what are user stories, what is out of scope, walk through the UX. In our standard template, I have what's called a narrative, which is, how do you pitch this product? Which I feel like is a thing product managers miss a lot, which is how to position and pitch it, sequencing and milestones, measurements and goals, all those sorts of things.

(00:58:33):
Now, that's the out-of-the-box template. As I said, you can actually customize what your PRD template is in ChatPRD if you do something different or want something different for your company. About 60% of people are using it for that. 30% of people, I would say, are using it to put in a spec or a PRD or a strategy doc or a roadmap and improve it. And then the rest are using it to brainstorm ideas, internal PM work. How do I come up with a good agenda for X, Y, and Z? That kind of stuff.

Lenny (00:59:02):
Amazing. Okay, so I wrote a post recently sharing a bunch of examples of how people are using different GPT specifically at work, and I think it's spurred a lot of people to experiment with this stuff. If there's one tip that you could share for someone that's trying to build a GPT or their own custom app using APIs, any advice?

Claire Vo (00:59:24):
Prompt matters. We went through this whole cycle of prompt engineering is a thing, it's not really a thing, fine-tuning is... Prompt really does matter, and a good PM, I do competitive analysis. I use the same input and look at different GPT or ChatGPT. I look at the GPT Store version, I look at other PM tools that do this and I look at mine. I think mine is actually better.

(00:59:50):
And then I'm getting into a mode now where I may do some model experimentation and tuning behind the scenes, so it might not be OpenAI, it may be other things, but it matters. The instructions matter, the context matters for the quality of the output is something that I would say when building these kinds of products. I think the other thing is there is no solution right now for monetization. Knock on wood, open it and we'll figure it out. If I had more time, maybe I would create a platform out of what I've created for ChatGPT to let other people monetize their GPTs and add on capabilities. But it's not out of the box yet for folks. There's a lot of work that I had to do to get it from here to there.

Lenny (01:00:31):
Are you making real money with this thing? And is it an idea that this becomes the thing you do someday maybe long term?

Claire Vo (01:00:38):
My original goal, and I said this out on X, my original goal is I just want to buy a nice glass of wine a week. That was my goal. I could buy cases of wine now. This is very exciting for me. It's making what I would consider real money. Is it a venture scale thing? No. Does it need to be? No. I have a goal around my kids' education expenses. I would love for this to cover a little bit. I have a ambitious but not audacious goal for ChatPRD.

(01:01:13):
The other goal that I have, which is, let's put monetization aside, is this is my joy space, zone of genius joy space. And my goal with ChatPRD is it has to be a hundred percent fun for me. This is my hobby, so I'm not doing anything that makes it not fun. It is a pure bliss space for me. I get to code on the weekends, I get to do customer support at night, and I get to build things that I would use. I get to learn new technologies. I want to keep it in that space because it provides a lot of joy for me. Put money aside, I just want it to be fun.

Lenny (01:01:51):
Love that. Okay, so some people listening to this, especially PMs, may be like, "Claire, what the hell are you doing? Are you going to replace product managers in a year or two?" This connects to something I've just generally been thinking about and that's come up a bunch, is just over time, which skills and jobs of a product manager will be greatly enhanced by AI and which will be completely replaced by AI, if any, so that people can understand which skills they should be investing in and which maybe are less important.

(01:02:22):
I guess just broadly, do you have a sense of just here's skills that are going to continue to be incredibly important and AI will not take these skills and jobs off your plate? Versus, these are going to be the less important, AI will do these?

Claire Vo (01:02:36):
At the highest level, I tend to be very short-term pessimistic, although I'll frame that short-term pessimistic and very long-term optimistic. I am a big believer that technology has made society generally much more affluent, wealthier, happier, healthier. I am a big believer in technology and I am optimistic about its impact on the human race. There are lots of things that are not going well, but I really do believe that innovation and technology, I'm excited for my kid's future. I'm not afraid of it.

(01:03:11):
Now, that being said, I am of the mind excitedly that this is going to change stuff in companies incredibly quickly. And part of building ChatPRD is I hold myself to the bar as a technology leader, I need to be leading the league on understanding what this can disrupt, using these tools to make a better team, and actually shifting the size and shape of my organization in response to the technology around us. Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the ratios between PMs and other teams going to shift over time? Yes. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably. I think there's a lot of change coming and I want to be prepared for it.

(01:04:00):
Now, what do I think this replaces and what does it not replace? I was reflecting on this question and communication, lowercase C, I feel like is one of the places that's going to be replaced. And I call it lowercase C. It's the functional trading of information that allows other people to do jobs. I think that these language models and these tools are really good synthesizing information, putting together communication, and can coordinate who that communication goes to and get it out in many modalities of content.

(01:04:41):
And so I'm really thinking about the PM as the keeper of cross-functional relationships and communication is really, I think, potentially going to change. Now, but capital C communication of are you influential? Are you convincing? Are you bold? Can you get this system of humans to follow you down a path? That's, I think, going to be much harder to replace, and so I'm thinking about the edges of communication and where they'll change and what they won't.

Lenny (01:05:15):
That's really interesting. I did a little poll on Twitter asking people of between communication, execution, strategy, and product sense, which skills are most likely to be basically taken over by AI. And communication was number one, by far. I have a contrarian perspective. And strategy was the least voted. I feel like, so strategy work is essentially, "Here's everything we know about the world and competitors and the market and our advantages. Here's a plan to win in the market essentially." I feel like that's what AI is incredibly good at.

Claire Vo (01:05:49):
I agree with you. I totally agree with you. I think, and again this comes to synthesis, good decision-making, and communication, if you can synthesize, distill it into a plan and communicate that plan, I found these tools exceptional. Use ChatPRD and give it a try.

(01:06:09):
Now, I think it's the human aspect though of boldness, seeing the future in a way that a thing trained on priors cannot. Those things I still think, and then charisma and attracting all those things to actually make the thing happen are pretty hard to replicate, which is why I love using ChatPRD. I'm not going to come up with the most genius way to do data export for Snowflake for some... That is a solved area that we should just scaffold up. I should customize it to what we do, and then we should ship it. That is not a place where my magic skills as a human are going to impact.

(01:06:54):
But I don't think a lot of PMs see it that way. I think there's this real identity shift that's going to happen where PMs think that their value is coming from their ideas that they manifest into the world and how they individually manifest them. And I think we're going to shift to, are you building the right stuff? Are you building it quickly? And is it delivering? No matter what the tool chain is.

Lenny (01:07:19):
Yeah. I think your point about getting buy-in and getting everyone aligned, I don't know how an AI bot does that unless everybody's got their own little bot and they're all talking to each other.

Claire Vo (01:07:29):
They all just get along.

Lenny (01:07:30):
We're in. I'll [inaudible 01:07:32] this a little higher.

Claire Vo (01:07:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:33):
I actually made this list. I feel like this could be the entire podcast, but I made it a quick list of, "Here's the jobs of a PM." And it's interesting. I don't know if this is really a question, but it's just interesting to think about which of these will some ChatPRD maybe do in the future. What does the job feel? You're writing PRDS, you're setting goals, proposing a roadmap, aligning a team behind a roadmap, developing a strategy, developing a vision, communicating timelines, finding blockers, and unblocking people, getting buy-in from up on high, getting budget resources for your team, giving feedback on product and design. Those are just some of the day-to-day jobs. I'm so curious just which of these AI can actually just do and not have to worry about it.

Claire Vo (01:08:17):
I think a lot of them AI can do. And so the question is, which of them do you want to hand the keys to an AI tool? And which of them are going to be much more valuable as a tool that an individual or a team's intellect can use to do a better, faster, higher impact job?

(01:08:38):
Again, I believe in technology and I think this stuff, what's interesting about this moment right now is every week I see something that I would not have in a million years thought was possible three years ago. Every week, something new comes out where it just changes my mind of what's possible. I believe all of those are 80% good functionally tractable. The question is, is 80% good functionally tractable the best way to do that? Or can we take a certain type of person with a certain skill set backed by a purpose-built toolkit and make it 3X better, 4X better, 10X better? I think that's the more interesting question.

Lenny (01:09:16):
I think on the point of amazing things are happening every day, we had SpaceX launched the Starship and it was barely mentioned anywhere. We have the spaceship that could take us to Mars and, "Meh, we don't need to talk about that."

Claire Vo (01:09:31):
We get the kids up and stream it on YouTube.

Lenny (01:09:32):
Oh, that's awesome.

Claire Vo (01:09:33):
It's magic. We live in this magic time. I think it's so fascinating. But I agree, we're getting spoiled by innovation.

Lenny (01:09:41):
You said that there's this ratio that might shift with product managers, engineers. I'm curious which ratio, because engineers are also getting more efficient, and so it's interesting if the ratios will be consistent as engineers become more efficient, PMs get it more efficient.

Claire Vo (01:09:53):
I wonder if whole roles get eliminated and replaced, and then ratios aren't even the right way to think about things. There's the ratio of this PM role to this many, one PM to seven to 10 engineers or one EM to... There's those ratios.

(01:10:12):
I also think there's going to be this interesting shift of as a manager, as a leader, how you allocate budget against tools and people I also think is going to shift. And I saw something where somebody said that every role that they got asked to open, the team had to spend a week trying to automate it before they were allowed to open the JD. It's just this very interesting... In my mind people, think that's scary and it's going to reduce jobs. Yes, and I do think there's also potentially other jobs that open up that can become very interesting.

(01:10:45):
And so I don't know how it's going to pencil out. I really don't. What I do know is things are going to change and I, as a leader and a person that cares for people's long-term careers, want to be much more forward-thinking than close my eyes to what the possible maybe dramatic changes are in our industry. I'm thinking about it, I'm experimenting with things, and I'm hoping that in our team in LaunchDarkly we're leading from the front here as opposed to on our back foot.

Lenny (01:11:17):
I'm thinking many people listening here are like, "Okay, I need to get on top of this. I need to stay ahead. I want to follow Claire's lead." Is your advice simply create GPTs, play with ChatGPT? Is there anything else there to help people?

Claire Vo (01:11:29):
I also think PMs need to be thinking about building product skills particularly around these non-deterministic products. It's been [inaudible 01:11:40]. Part of why I built ChatPRD is not just to stress test how these sorts of things are going to change the product function. It's literally, this is a new type of product built by a new type of technology and it's moving very fast. And learning how to build these kinds of products, if you can do that, I just think back to when mobile happened, if you're a PM that jumped on mobile, you had the pick of the litter when it came to jobs in very interesting startups.

(01:12:11):
And so I think we're in the same moment here where, if you can ratchet down and specialize and learn a new technology, you actually can get into very interesting positions. Those are both of my motivations on ChatPRD, is understand how it impacts the function that I lead, but also understand how to build a great product with these underlying technologies that are just much different than the technologies that I personally built on before.

Lenny (01:12:37):
And so for someone, let's say, not super engineering-oriented, I guess how do you recommend people on your team explore this sort of thing? Is it [inaudible 01:12:46]?

Claire Vo (01:12:45):
Yeah. I do think studying products that are out there is quite interesting. I love this idea of doing outside-in product tear-downs. What is good about this? What is bad about this? How would I have written the PRD here? What would I be measuring? How would I think about error states? How would I think about if this is a great product, a good product, or an okay product? I do think doing that sort of crit on an external product can be a really accessible way to start to stress test your own skills around this and figure out where there are gaps.

(01:13:20):
That's one thing I think you can do. Two, I think there's a lot of no-code, low-code stuff you can play with. Even if you can't put your hands on keyboard and write code, you can certainly stitch together things and try some no-code tools. That's another way to do it. The other thing is find where it's fun. I think how fun is Midjourney? How fun are some of these more creative tools? And so find where there's something fun and build art out of it as a mechanism for learning. It doesn't always have to be commercially driven. It doesn't have to be part of work. It can just be find a space that you're personally interested in and play with what's out there.

Lenny (01:14:00):
Awesome. One last question about ChatPRD. With Copilot, there's all these stats. It's making engineers 50% more efficient, whatever percentage. Do you have any sense of efficiency gains so far with ChatPRD?

Claire Vo (01:14:14):
I have qualitative feedback from product managers who have used ChatPRD, who have said, "This has saved me dozens of hours I would've spent on writing documents." And another person said, "I am a single PM on a team that's growing and I don't think we're going to have to hire another PM now." There's the people, there's both the individual aspect and the hours aspect, which is it's helping individuals PMs get higher leverage across a broad engineering or building team, and that it's helping them spend their time more effectively.

Lenny (01:14:57):
Many people don't want to hear that they don't need to hire a PM. There's many people looking for jobs right now.

Claire Vo (01:14:59):
It's true, but we can't... I think we saw this in the last couple of years. Inefficiently hiring and building unsustainable costs into a company leads no one to success. And if that's a lesson that I can teach anybody, it's sustainability in organizations is the responsibility of a leader. Yes, I would love to give everybody positions. There are not positions to have. And the best I can do for the people in the team is be really responsible and really thoughtful about that because that helps me grow their careers and helps me sustain their careers long-term.

(01:15:41):
It's incredibly complicated, but also on the flip side, this is a very small startup. They can't afford another PM and they're extending their runway to build something transformational by not growing the team. And so, yes, people [inaudible 01:15:57] their teams and have these jobs and startups can't afford it, and they still have great things to do in the world.

Lenny (01:16:04):
Great answer. To start to wrap up our conversation, I have these two segments, Failure Corner and Contrarian Corner, and we can pick which corner you want to head to. Would you like to share a story of your career where you failed and something you learned from that? Or something you believe that most people don't believe? Which corner sounds more interesting?

Claire Vo (01:16:24):
I'll take Contrarian Corner.

Lenny (01:16:26):
Let's go for there.

Claire Vo (01:16:27):
Yep.

Lenny (01:16:28):
I need some sound effects for these corners. Do share.

Claire Vo (01:16:33):
I'm sharing this because you just released your podcast with Marty again. And I'm a sales-led product apologist unabashedly, which is, I think that it is okay to listen to the market and to be commercially oriented in products in ways that probably would make some folks in some types of product organizations squirm a little bit. And the reason why I believe this is I think there are tremendous businesses built on sales-led motions. And I disagree with the fact that that means you do not care for the craft or the experience of users. I think it can be the best of both worlds.

(01:17:19):
I love sales. I say if I was not in this role, put me on a quota and make me enterprise West. I love to sell, but I think product teams, this opposition we have industry-wide with sales-led I'm not convinced is healthy in every organization. And I was listening to the podcast and I think you all were talking about, you said, "SAP is like this. And who wants to be SAP?" Man alive. There are a lot of companies out there that would love to be SAP, now with a better product, with better experience, with more love from the industry maybe. But what a powerhouse company. And I think we as PMs turn our nose up to powerhouse companies too often because we want companies to be product-led, not sales-led.

Lenny (01:18:07):
Amazing. I'm going to not go deeper into this topic because I don't want to be speaking on behalf of Marty's perspective, but there's so much debate that came out of that episode and I love that it trickles to more opinions being shared about ways product can work.

(01:18:20):
I guess, just to understand your takeaway here, is sales-led companies can be awesome. They can build amazing businesses, and it can be great to be a PM at a company like that.

Claire Vo (01:18:27):
Yeah, and they can build great products.

Lenny (01:18:30):
Great. Claire, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Claire Vo (01:18:39):
I will say, because we've been talking a lot about AI and replacing PMs, I love to sell. I love to help people get jobs, so if there are ways that I can help people find great fit companies, it's one of the things that I get a lot of energy out of. I just want to say that in the world. It's something that sparks a lot of joy. I get a lot of it inbound, "Can you help me get in here? Can you help me get there?" But if there is a tractable way that I can help you get to a connected to a company or a role that you think is great for you, that's fun for me and I'm totally open to it.

Lenny (01:19:09):
How would people reach out to you to try to help you get them [inaudible 01:19:13]?

Claire Vo (01:19:15):
I am, of course, on LinkedIn. I'm on X at ClaireVo, all one word. And then if you really want to go into the archives, I have a very fabulous TikTok where I'm ChiefProductOfficer. It's all one word.

Lenny (01:19:27):
Amazing. We'll link to all these in the show notes. And we will refresh these two facts at the end of the podcast anyway, because I always ask this anyway. Before we do that, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Claire Vo (01:19:28):
I am so ready.

Lenny (01:19:41):
Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Claire Vo (01:19:46):
High Growth Handbook I love, and I like Scaling People. These are two books that the reason why I recommend them to people is because they have solid playbook answers to 80%, 90% of everyday leadership scaling people questions. And so they're just great reference books for what I think great leadership inside startups can look like, and they solve some of the things that you don't need to solve novel-ly. And then one on the fiction side that I've been recommending is Circe, which is a retelling of Circe's story from her perspective. It's a great read, and everybody I've recommended it to really loves it.

Lenny (01:20:28):
From Game of Thrones?

Claire Vo (01:20:31):
No, Circe from the Odyssey. Odysseus [inaudible 01:20:34]. She turns men into pigs.

Lenny (01:20:36):
[inaudible 01:20:36] lack of culture.

Claire Vo (01:20:37):
It's great. My kids are very into Greek mythology, so this is me meeting them on my side.

Lenny (01:20:42):
Amazing. The first two books are both Straight Press. Shout out to Straight Press.

Claire Vo (01:20:46):
Yeah, Straight Press.

Lenny (01:20:47):
And I have both books in the back there, and my laptop's actually sitting on Scaling People.

(01:20:52):
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Claire Vo (01:20:57):
I have kids, so I don't get to go see movies. Movies are, that's an adventure. It's basically a vacation. I saw Poor Things, which if you like capital W weird capital A art, highly recommend Poor Things. The show that I recommend to people, I love Mythic Quest. Everybody references Silicon Valley, but Mythic Quest gets at some of, I was in gaming once, gets at some of my experiences in the technology organizations. It's got a technical female lead and think it's quite funny. I like Mythic Quest.

Lenny (01:21:31):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Claire Vo (01:21:31):
I like to ask candidates how they would improve our business model. I think so many PMs come in with a point of view of the product and the target market but don't actually understand the underlying mechanisms of how we make money and what our unit economics are and how that could be improved. And the candidates that do come in and have a strong point of view on business model often are pretty successful in our organization.

Lenny (01:21:55):
And what do you look for in a good answer that's, "Oh wow, this candidate's great?"

Claire Vo (01:21:59):
It's thinking along the chain of value from how do we identify people in the market? What does our pricing model look like? What could they hypothesize our underlying unit economics or cogs are? And then where are their points of leverage along that whole funnel? It's really, do they have a mental model for thinking about a business model? Have they thought at all about how we make money, either top line or margin? And then can they identify places where they might improve it?

Lenny (01:22:28):
Awesome. Basically understanding the business really well. Great.

(01:22:30):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Claire Vo (01:22:36):
Okay, I'm going to make you laugh because you've gotten all these cars, right?

Lenny (01:22:40):
Yeah, I have such expensive cars.

Claire Vo (01:22:42):
You've got expensive cars. It's not new, I love my minivan. I am a big fan of my minivan. As my friend says, "It's like driving around your living room." And when you have two kids, you know what I want to do? I just want to drive around my living room, Bluey included. And so no Rivian, no Mercedes-Benz, but I really love my Pacifica.

Lenny (01:23:06):
Pacifica? Okay, I was going to ask.

Claire Vo (01:23:07):
But the actual car product that I really love, I love Waymo. We're in San Francisco, we've got these autonomous vehicles. It is, top to bottom, just a lovely product experience from the app to when it shows up, the sound design is great, the cars are comfortable, the displays in the car are great. It is, now every time a tourist comes in, a friend comes in to visit San Francisco, I make them take a round-trip ride in a robot car. And then even I've had a customer service experience with the Waymo team where my friend left an iPhone and [inaudible 01:23:44] and customer experience was great, 24-hour service. Top to bottom, great product design, great service design.

Lenny (01:23:53):
I just got into Waymo actually in the wait list, and so I'm excited to actually try it. I was actually treated as press early on to ride in a Waymo with a person from the company, just to experience it. And then I never got access to it after. Now, I finally can try it.

Claire Vo (01:24:08):
Enjoy. It's so nice. It's my preferred mode of travel.

Lenny (01:24:12):
The future. We've talked about a lot of ways the world is changing. That's another great example.

(01:24:18):
Two questions to go. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family they find useful in work or in life?

Claire Vo (01:24:26):
Fast beats right. Every time when debating between, do I noodle this for a thousand years and try to come to the perfect solution or do I make a decision and get executing and direction I have conviction on, I consistently see and believe that fast at the end of the day, wins. Fast beats right.

Lenny (01:24:51):
Final question. You mentioned TikTok. You put a bunch of awesome content out on TikTok. Any advice, slash is there a tip you could share with someone that is trying to be successful on TikTok from your experience?

Claire Vo (01:25:03):
I've been neglecting my TikTok for a little bit with new job and winter with sick kids. This is my advice, and I think you know this, consistency drives audience growth, which is, when I was on TikTok posting every day, you would get followers and engagement and the algorithm would bless you. And when you don't, you don't. I think consistency in almost all things wins.

(01:25:27):
The other thing that I think is a really good advice for any quote-unquote creator of whatever scale, of whatever ambition, is I think thinking about content creation as documentation, not creative generation is really helpful. I just like to talk about what I think about at work and I like to, an interesting meeting or interesting interaction, document why I thought that was interesting or what could be done better. And that becomes the basis of a very natural flow of content for me. It's a tactic that's worked really well for me and helps me do stuff in my free time.

Lenny (01:26:00):
Amazing. It might be time to start exploring Instagram also with all this TikTok news.

Claire Vo (01:26:05):
I know. Yep.

Lenny (01:26:06):
Claire, before we started this podcast, I asked you what your goal for this was, and it was to be helpful to people. I think we've 100% done that in so many different ways. Thank you again so much for being here.

(01:26:16):
Two final questions. We already covered these, but just to refresh people's memories, where can people find you online if they want to reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Claire Vo (01:26:24):
LinkedIn, X, I'm ClaireVo, all one word. And then on TikTok, get me back into it. Give me a follow, maybe I'll start posting some of my excellent content. But it's @ChiefProductOfficer.

Lenny (01:26:37):
Awesome. And then how can people be useful to you?

Claire Vo (01:26:41):
Help each other. That's what I want the most, which is I do really see, it is a tough time in tech right now and there are a lot of people looking for jobs. One, I think help each other. And then the other thing that I really, if I could ask your audience anything, is if you have a job where your job is typing into an internet box to create products out of nothing, really acknowledge the privilege and joy of that job and try to have some fun because a lot of people want to sit where you're sitting. Have fun. Appreciate what you have. Enjoy it. Enjoy each other.

Lenny (01:27:13):
Great and important advice to leave people with. Claire, thank you so much for being here.

Claire Vo (01:27:13):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:27:18):

# Lessons from 1,000+ YC startups: Resilience, tar pit ideas, pivoting, more | Dalton Caldwell (YC)

## Transcript

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:00):
Seeing everything people apply to YC with. People all have the same idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:04):
One of these themes is simple, pragmatic advice. Sell shit, make money.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:07):
One of my mantras is just don't die. Being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics puts you in the right mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You have this concept of tarpit ideas.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:17):
Seems like an unsolved problem. You'll get all this positive feedback from the world and people have been starting that startup since the '90s.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
Recently you put out a request for startups, 20 categories of ideas and the YC wants to fund.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:28):
We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating they are currently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
A lot of people say you're the king of the pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:36):
A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Are there other patterns you find across startups that do well?

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:43):
There's a lot of founders that come this close to it, all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Dalton Caldwell. Dalton is managing director and group partner at Y Combinator where he's worked for over 10 years across 21 different YC batches, including working closely in the earliest days of Instacart, Retool, Brex, Deal, DoorDash, Webflow, Replit, Amplitude, Whatnot, Razorpay and 20 other Unicorns. Prior to Y Combinator, Dalton was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, which was acquired by Myspace, and Co-founder and CEO of App.net, which was an early ads-free competitor to Twitter. Dalton has seen and worked with more startups than nearly any human alive and in our conversation we get incredibly tactical and deep on the startup journey. Why it all comes down to simply not losing hope and not letting your startup die. What to do when your startup is struggling and how to know when it is time to give up. What makes a great pivot and signs it's time to pivot. How to actually talk to customers.

(00:01:50):
Why every single startup goes through a point where they feel like all hope is lost. Why investors say no to startups. What most often leads to startups failing. Why you need to avoid over-delegating early on. Plus startup ideas that you should avoid. And also 20 ideas Dalton is looking to fund. Also so many great stories and lessons. This episode is action packed. With that, I bring you Dalton Caldwell after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Dalton Caldwell (00:04:45):
Yeah. Thanks so much, Lenny. I'm really excited to talk to you today. It's been great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
So to prep for this podcast interview, I asked a bunch of founders that worked with you during YC what advice you shared with them along the journey that was most transformative to the way they think about product, the way they think about building their startup, the way they operate. And there's a bunch of themes that emerged and I'm going to touch on a number of these themes. One of these themes is just how often you get to very simple pragmatic advice and how much of your message is just sell shit, make money, don't run out of money. Why do you think founders need to hear this advice, which is seemingly simple and obvious?

Dalton Caldwell (00:05:22):
Have you ever seen in NBA basketball or college basketball where they have the coach mic'd up and it shows what they're actually saying in the huddle? You ever listen to what they actually are saying? They're like, "Okay, we need to really focus and get the ball and win this game." If you actually listen to what the greatest, smartest, most successful athletes are talking about, if you listen to what Tiger Woods is saying to his caddy, it all sounds like pretty mundane stuff. It's not like what Tiger Woods is talking about with his caddy is some impossible to decipher jargon. It's like, "Yeah, you really need to keep your head down on this one." It's things like that. And I think the reason this is true is that even if you're in the best in the world, being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics is what puts you in the right mindset and that you already know everything, right? You're at the top of your game if you make it to the elite levels of being a startup founder or basically doing anything that's really hard psychologically.

(00:06:33):
And so yeah, one of my mantras is just don't die. Just keep your startup going. Just keep going. And I say that over and over again and honestly, that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said. It's not that I said some Ninja 5D chess mood that they never would've thought of before. It's just the constant affirmation that continuing to keep going and doing high quality reps is the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:04):
I know that you'd give a talk that's exactly called that, How Not To Die. Just to pull on this thread a little bit more, what is the general advice you share there for people that also don't want to die?

Dalton Caldwell (00:07:14):
The way to summarize that is if you look at all the startup stories that we have at YC and all the companies we funded over all the years, the underlying theme is that rationally the founder should have given up at some point. And so again, let's talk about Airbnb, obviously something you know a lot about. They probably should have shut down three or four times before they got into YC. It objectively wasn't working. They were basically ruining their lives, they were disappointing their parents, everything was wrong and it was a purely irrational act for the founders of Airbnb to keep working on their goofy startup. And again, that's just one story. If you look across the portfolio of YC and non-YC companies, there has to be this irrational intention to keep going even when the world tells you it's not working and you feel completely defeated. And you likely have to go through this many times and have these near-death experiences. And then you get lucky and then you look like an overnight success. Right?

(00:08:26):
And so that is the theme that is a summary and I provide lots of data and lots of stories there, but this is one of those things that the longer I have this job, the more I really, really believe this is true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
What's your advice on the flip side of that where there's a lot of startups, especially these days that are just super struggling, have been added for a while, there are mental health challenges, they'd be very sad if they had to shut this thing down, but often it's probably the right move? What's your advice to folks on deciding, okay, actually does make sense to give up in this case?

Dalton Caldwell (00:09:01):
I think this is a nuanced question and it's hard for me to say something on a podcast that'll actually be useful to people, but here's a couple of thoughts. One, are you still having fun? Do you still enjoy doing what you're doing? Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders? Is this actually a fun thing you're doing? And if the answer there is yes, I would tend to lean on the keep going. And then if it's more of, wow, this is actually profoundly affecting me a negative way and my relationships with people in my life and I don't really want to work with my co-founder anymore and things like that, then I would lean on the probably don't do it anymore. Something that a lot of the folks that turn it around have in common is they actually do love their customers and they love their product.

(00:09:51):
And again, in the Airbnb story, again, you know it really well, but they really liked Airbnb and they liked working with each other and they liked the first host that they met and they knew all their names. You know what I'm saying? They loved their startup even though it was going bad. And so that's to me a signal to keep going is that you really, really love what you're doing and the people you're doing it with and you love your customers and you love the problem. Versus where you're just like, "Yeah, I could care less about any of those things. I'm just having a bad time." Harder to be encouraging in that situation. And this is a fixable situation. You can make it more like the thing you love, can't you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Yeah. This is actually very practical and great advice. This is something people can sense, "Okay, am I actually enjoying this? Do I want to keep doing this?" Versus, "Man, such a drag that I have to keep running this startup." Is there anything you could say to folks that are just like, "I can't stop because it'll feel like I failed"?

Dalton Caldwell (00:10:50):
If it's really going poorly or if you're having a really bad time, it's no big deal. No one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years time. As long as you have integrity, as long as you're an honest person, as long as you handle yourself well through good times and bad, people will remember you fondly. We have such a short life. There's only so many years we get to have our careers, doing something that makes you miserable and the only reason you're doing it is to avoid losing face and you know in your heart is not going to work, I don't know, that seems like a pretty big opportunity cost on literally your life. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
Yeah, that's exactly what I tell founders all the time. Life is short. There's no need to force yourself to work on this. And I really like your point of just, is it still enjoyable? Do you like working with your founders? Following this thread of the struggle training a little bit more, one of the founders that worked with you during YC, his name is Danny Alberson, shared a story how during one of the batches of YC, one of the founders raised his hand and asked you, "What is wrong with our batch? Everyone is struggling, nobody is doing well. What have we done wrong?" And you shared a story about Brex that made everyone feel a little better. Does that ring a bell and if so, can you share that?

Dalton Caldwell (00:12:08):
That definitely happened and I think the story is the story of the Winter-17 batch. And in the Winter-17 batch, I funded something like, I don't know, 35, 40 companies in my group. So we subset them into groups. So it wasn't a lot of companies and I knew all of them really well. And founders can't help but compare themselves with other founders all the time about who's doing well and who's not doing well. And there was this one company in my group, this batch, it was called Vyond, that was their name at the time and it was a VR headset thing from these Stanford dropouts. And they basically showed up to group office hours and were just ashamed and they're like, "Our idea is horrible. We might want to shut our company down. This is really embarrassing." I had to beg them to not give up basically. And if you would've asked people in the batch what the worst company was, I think they would've said this one. Again, not because they were bad people but the founders themselves seemed despondent about how it was going.

(00:13:13):
And then funnily enough, this is in the story too, there was another startup also in my group called Cashew, which was this P2P Venmo, excuse me, in the UK and it was going really poorly also and not growing. And so if you just took this snapshot in time in the middle of the batch of who is definitely not doing well, it would clearly have been this Vyond company and this Cashew company. And so to cut to the chase, Vyond changed their idea and got really excited about it and renamed to Brex and this was Brex, which is like a decacorn. And Cashew changed their idea and renamed to something called Retool. And so out of my 35 companies, the ones that objectively seemed the worst in terms of everything is going bad, were by far, in retrospect, the most successful companies in that group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):
Wow. Wait, so you're saying Brex was a VR headset company?

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:14):
They thought it was really high-tech. They want to do a really high-tech startup, and so they're like, "We're going to build a new VR headset." And yeah, they were good programmers, but they just didn't know anything about optics or the things you might want to be an expert in to build a headset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):
Wow, that's an amazing story. It's a great segue to just another theme that emerged from talking to founders about advice that you've shared. A lot of people tell me you are the king of the pivot of helping people figure out how to pivot. I'm curious just what you've seen makes a good pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:45):
Usually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? And so in the case of Brex, it was they had worked on a FinTech company in Brazil when they were younger, and so I'm like, "You need to work more on the thing all about and not the thing nothing about." And that was what worked for them. In the case of Retool, it was the same thing. They had built similar internal tools both at their internships as well as for Cashew. They had all these dashboards they built to operate their Venmo competitor. And so they knew a lot about what to build in the case of postprod, pivoting and through idea, they knew a lot about analytics and had strong opinions about it. And so it was much closer than what the original idea is.

(00:15:41):
In the case of Zip, Rujul knows a lot about a lot of things and he knew a lot about the crazy picture and process at Airbnb because he worked there. A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you... And it never occurred to you that this thing you know all about would be a good idea or maybe you consciously are like, "I don't want to work on this because burnt out on it." Sometimes someone has to get over this barrier they have on why they don't want to work on a certain idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:18):
These are amazing. I like how modest you are. I'm like, "Oh, here's a big idea." And then you just give very tactical items to look for. So essentially a good pivot in your experience is you're getting closer, warmer towards something you have actual experience in, and two, it builds on something you've done. Can be essentially the core idea of a pivot, right? Where you're...

Dalton Caldwell (00:16:38):
In the example of Segment, which is obviously a really big successful company, they started with something to tell your professor you were confused in class. It was software that they sold to universities. And then they ended up pivoting to something like a mixed panel competitor after two years and it's because they learned about how analytics works running their first idea, okay? And then no one wanted to adopt their mixed panel competitor. And so they were like, "We should make this JavaScript thing that you embed on your website that can send events to multiple endpoints at the same time so that way people would be willing to try our mixed panel competitor side by side with mixed panels to show that it's better." And then they were like, "Oh yeah, no one actually wants that. They just want this JavaScript to send events to different locations." And so there's no way those founders could have started with the final idea. You get what I mean?

(00:17:30):
There was no universe where they would've made up the idea for Segment because they didn't know anything about how analytics worked, but because they were grinding for multiple years and became experts on these things is a side effect of their earlier ideas. They ended up with really good unique insights.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):
I think that's a really important point there is you don't need to necessarily have that experience before you start the company, could come from trying to build the company.

Dalton Caldwell (00:17:51):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
A big question people are always wondering is, should I pivot? Is this the time to pivot? Should I keep trying this idea? What's your advice there of just, okay, now you should really be thinking about something else?

Dalton Caldwell (00:18:02):
Again, this is one of those where I like to give very bespoke nuanced advice on a case by case basis to the folks in YC. But again, just to give you a preview of how I would think about it, I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them. Right? Hey, give it a shot. Again, in the Airbnb story, right? They tried all sorts of stuff including cereal and conventions. They had a bunch of zany ideas on growth and they didn't run out of them. And so I think when there's still gas in the tank on an idea that might be a reason to stay the course. And when literally the founder is like, "Yeah, I don't know, I guess maybe we should pay influencers or something." When that's the kind of ideas they're coming up with, that might be a better sign to pivot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
That is incredibly helpful. Coming back to Zip real quick, they went through I think six different pivots before they landed on this idea that is now a billion-dollar business. Is there anything from that specific journey that you found really interesting? Because they went in so many different directions like accounting, marketplaces and-

Dalton Caldwell (00:19:18):
Yeah. I think in the example of the Zip founders, they were both such great experts and I knew Rujul really well. He actually worked with me at YC as a visiting partner. And so I was really close to Rujul and he had done this marketplace called FlightCar when he was younger, which was raised a series B, it didn't work out, but it was a really cool company. And I had a lot of confidence in his competence on running a business and executing fast and just having great instincts. He really knows the fundamentals and the problem was they weren't as clear on what market to go into, is still with me. And so I actually suggested to do something in their case, again, this is very bespoke, but my suggestion was to start by looking at what companies are publicly traded and/or owned by private equity that are large and that also are hated by their customers, and to try to intentionally find where there's a knowable big market within incumbent combined with the software is horrible.

(00:20:29):
And they did that. They basically found out about all this procurement software and what the state of the art was and that was the prompt. Again, maybe he told you this, that was basically the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):
He did tell me that. I love that example and piece of advice so much. I don't know why more people don't do this. Basically find a large incumbent with very low NPS and try to disrupt them. So straightforward.

Dalton Caldwell (00:20:54):
Yeah, I mean, I can't promise that works for everyone, but again, in the very bespoke situation with Rujul, it worked really well because he actually knew exactly once he locked in on that prompt, oh man, he ran a masterclass. They did an A-plus job, was really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Also Lou, his co-founder, credit to him too.

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:14):
Of course. Sorry. Yeah. We got to give Lou the shout-out. Lou did an amazing job. I just didn't know Lou as well before he did YC. But you're right, we got to give Lou the credit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
I was watching your chat with Michael Seibel talking about pivots and either you or he used this phrase of you want to move towards the mountains in the desert to find the gold of a new startup idea versus the middle of the city. You're unlikely to find gold in the middle of San Francisco. Is there anything along those lines that you can share?

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:41):
Yeah, I think maybe this pertains into what we see from applications and interviews, which is from where I sit seeing everything people apply to YC with and what they interview with and whatnot. People all have the same idea. Basically imagine this, imagine your information consumption where you're listening to the same podcast, wink, wink, you're reading the same people on Twitter, you're reading the same blog post. Basically you have the same information diet of all these other founders and you're friends with all the same people. Does it seem surprising then that you would all end up with similar startup ideas or similar philosophies on what makes a good startup idea? Of course you are. So this is the metaphor on cities is that if you just are following the same principles and have the same information flow into your brain, you're going to come up with the same ideas with everybody else.

(00:22:37):
And so the prompt here is to try to go more off the beaten path either from your personal experience, like in the case of Brex and Retool or Whatnot. There was no one else trying to build marketplaces for Funko Pops. Go deeper in your own personal interests or experience to find something that just your exact peer wouldn't come up with in exactly the same way. And again, the Zip example, I don't think other people were trying to build wonky procurement software. That was not an idea that we saw much of. And so again, the prompt to people is try to mix up what your information diet is or what areas of expertise you have and mine that well, versus just having all the same thoughts as everybody else. And so again, let me give you one more example.

(00:23:24):
A few years ago, startups around trucking were super new and fresh because no one was doing them and they worked really well and then it became completely conventional wisdom to do trucking related startups. I'm not trying to diss anyone, but you'll see things that become fashionable really quickly because someone found success in this unfashionable space and then it becomes fashionable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:45):
This is a good segue to something I definitely want to spend time on, which is you have this concept of tarpit ideas, which are essentially ideas people all gravitate towards and get stuck in and either pivot into and then can't pivot out of or try to pivot out of. And essentially it's just consistently bad startup ideas that people continue to try to start. Can you just talk about this and then what is examples of just bad startup ideas that people should stop trying to start?

Dalton Caldwell (00:24:10):
For people that are familiar with this terminology from us, sometimes they get defensive and don't get what we were saying. By definition it is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea. Do you get what I'm trying to say? A bad startup idea is, I don't know, something that is obviously bad or something where you just can't get any positive feedback on. But some of the most common tarpit would be something like building an app to coordinate with your friends to decide where to go out at night or where to meet up with people, which is really, it's coming from a good place. It's a good idea.

(00:25:10):
If you ask your friends, "Hey, would you like an app for us to coordinate to hang out more so we can be friends?" They're like, "Yeah, I would love that." You'll get all this positive feedback from the world. And man, people have been starting that startup since the '90s and so you can validate it. Part of being a true tarpit is that you can get good initial validation. Do you get what I mean? And so anyway. And honestly I worked on tarpit ideas myself as a founder, which is a music discovery. This is something I did in my first startup. Music startups are hard and trying to be like, "Oh, we're going to fix music discovery." This was classic things where you can get lots of positive feedback and even get users to work on those things, but there are aspects of it that make it a very hard idea. So does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
Absolutely. I'm also guilty of this. I had this startup called Localmind that allowed you to talk to people, check-in in various locations around the city, on Foursquare and Google back in the day and asked them, "How's it going?" And everyone when they used it, they're like, "Holy shit, this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. I could see what's happening at this bar that I'm about to go to." And then they never use it again.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:19):
Do you remember when Foursquare clones was all anyone worked on for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):
Yeah.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:21):
Years?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
They told us Foursquare is going to own this. There's no way this idea you're building is going to be its own thing. And now, yeah, Foursquare is a B2B business.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:30):
Yeah. And all the Foursquare clones, if they didn't pivot out of doing what they're doing, wouldn't have worked. So anyway, that's a tarpit, is just something that's super appealing and a lot of people do it. And then you can get validation and that's why is a tarpit, is it draws you in and you get stuck because it seems like it's a good idea and you get all this positive feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
Along these lines, I was talking to a founder recently and she's asking me, "What causes an investor to say no to you when you're trying to raise money from them?" And I know every investor has a very different perspective on what turns them off to a startup, but is there anything that you find is just like, here, if you do these things, investors will say no.

Dalton Caldwell (00:27:09):
Maybe my best advice here is for founders to put themselves in the shoes of investors and just imagine what their life is like and how if you are in their shoes you would make decisions. And so given this framework, a lot of investors just don't make that many investments and as per what we talked about earlier, life is short. And so there's lots of things that an investor that in their hearts thinks it is pretty good and they're like, "Oh, I like this person and I like their pitch, but I only am going to do a few investments. And so even though I really like a lot about this, I'm going to say no." And I often think that founders think that there's some secret truth that's being held from them on why someone says no or they want more feedback. "I need feedback." That's like, well, the feedback is we didn't want to invest and it really is just that.

(00:28:05):
And so I think if you put yourself in the shoes of an investor of like, "Hey, I only could do a few of these a year, I have very limited budget." They're really just trying to pick the things that they're either personally most excited about or things that they think can be truly phenomenally big in some way. Or again, I know you do investments too, so it's that you only get so many shots as an investor. And so anything that doesn't seem like this is the one, this is the one I want to do is a no. And that that's actually why they're saying no versus, "Oh, you had a bad zoom setup or something. Oh, we didn't like what color your shirt was. We said no." I don't think that's how this actually works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
I think that's such a good piece of advice that it's not necessarily they don't believe in what you're doing, it's they have better options and they're waiting for something that hits the higher bar because they have a lot of options.

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:00):
Yeah. Because again, if you ask someone or put yourself in the investor's shoes, wouldn't you be making decisions the same way? Usually founders are like, "Yeah." If you do that exercise, a lot of this starts to make way more sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Specifically when you're evaluating startups. I wasn't going to go into this, but I think it might be interesting, is market size. How do you think about the importance of large TAM as an investor YC?

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:25):
I think it really depends on what stage you're investing at and it's absolutely critical the later stage you get. Right? If you're going to invest in a very high valuation, it is really important. The earlier you go, the less it matters. And some of the most phenomenally good startups, if you were really pedantic about it, the TAM would be tiny. The TAM of Uber would be nothing, right? The TAM of Airbnb would've been nothing. TI funded Razorpay, which is I think the largest payment processor in India, and the TAM of that was tiny because no one was using credit cards in 2015 in India. So you had to believe that the size of the credit card industry in India would 100X. Well, guess what happened? You know what I'm saying? So I'm not saying that having a large market someday doesn't matter, of course it does eventually. But trying to be super pedantic about market size when it's a pre-seed company or someone applying to YC, it's just not something I'd put a lot of thought.

(00:30:34):
And again, Whatnot. What's the TAM of the collectible Funko Pop industry? I don't know. I don't think it's that big, man. I don't know if you did that analysis when you invested, but I think is pretty small, but I wasn't worried about it. That was the last thing I was worried about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):
It makes so much sense that at YC you don't think about it that much because of, as you said, many startups pivot anyway. So if you like the team-

Dalton Caldwell (00:30:57):
Yeah. And I'm not saying it's not important, it's not... And the things I'm worried about is like, hey, how do you get users? Hey, how do you grow? Things like that. Are you making something people want? Those are the things I'm really worried about as opposed to, ooh, I ran an Excel model and I'm worried this might not be a big enough TAM. That's not the top of my list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:15):
I think it's important to acknowledge that a lot of investors are very... YC I think is unique in a lot of ways where you invest very early and you help people through this journey. A lot of investors are very focused on TAM, so you may find you're getting turned down because they don't think there's a big enough market for you to build a big business, right?

Dalton Caldwell (00:31:32):
Yeah. Or that you're asking them to believe a crazy leap of faith that, again, they could say, "Well, it's theoretically possible you'll be able to sell more than Funko Pops, and I understand that that is your pitch, but I have other opportunities that are less risky." You know what I'm saying? A lot of founders make the argument that the TAM is big, and you can say, "Wow, that's a really interesting argument and I'm not going to argue with you about it, but no, I'm not going to..." And so again, it's hard to get someone to engage in a debate about TAM even if you have some proof points. Ultimately, a lot of investors just don't like that risk. Fair enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:15):
Fair enough. Going in a slightly different direction. So someone else that worked with you, another Lenny, Lenny Bogdonoff who started a company called Milk, and then he was head of growth at OpenAI for a bit. He asked me to ask you about things product leaders and startups should watch out for. Does that ring a bell?

Dalton Caldwell (00:32:35):
I don't remember the specific office hours, but I understand the question and I of course remember Lenny. I think that the advice that he's referencing here is just how important it is to not overdelegate and for the founders to stay close to things, as well as watch out for the trap of hiring super senior people with fancy resumes, really early in a startup. I think that's what he's referencing there. And again, this is definitely one of those very basic things that we find ourselves repeating a lot where they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. Don't overdelegate. We get it, Dalton." And then two years later they're like, "Wow, we overdelegated. We need to go clean that up." So that is probably the best product advice. And the folks that are really great at product, the founders that are always deeply in the weeds on product and still care a lot and are still talking to customers, no matter how late stage it gets, again, I'm sure you experienced this in Airbnb culture, but you can't delegate caring about your users and you can't delegate caring that the product is great. That is so critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:36):
To make this even more real, what is it that you see them do? It's they hire a PM too early, they hire a senior salesperson too early, what are the-

Dalton Caldwell (00:33:43):
Yeah, I think that you get pushed often by investors to hire executives or to scale the team or you raise all this money, you got to spend it, you got to show you're serious about growth and building a world-class organization, whatever, stuff like that. And so you end up with super nice people with super shiny resumes from big tech companies. "Oh wow, they did this amazing thing at Google." And then they hire them and then you wake up one day and you're like, "Oh wow, everything went wrong." It's not really anyone's fault, it's just that you took your eye off the ball and this is what happens to first-time founders a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):
How do you as a founder then have time to do all these things? Is there any guidance you give just like don't overdelegate, don't over hire? But also, you have 24 hours in a day? Is it just find the time, prioritize well, or is there more to it?

Dalton Caldwell (00:34:39):
I think if you just care a lot about your customers and you care a lot about the product, your instincts are pretty good on what to spend time on. And so for example, spending tons and tons of time hanging out with investors and networking, it's probably the thing that I would be cutting. You know what I'm saying? It's what we talked about earlier. If you really love what you're doing, no one needs to tell you how to reprioritize your time. Your intuition will be correct on what you should be spending all your time on, which is being obsessed with product.

Okay, so one of your current colleagues, not former colleagues, Gustav, was on the podcast previously. His episode is, I think, the fourth most popular episode of all time currently, so no pressure.

Dalton Caldwell (00:36:54):
Oh, Cool. Okay. I don't know if I can feed with that. All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:56):
I think you can. So I asked him what is often the most common reason a startup fails? And his answer was they don't talk to customers, they don't find product market fit. They nothing else matters if they can't do that. And so his advice is talk to customers more often. So two questions here. First of all, just is there anything else you would add to why do startups fail? I know we talked about some of these already, but just what comes to mind there?

Dalton Caldwell (00:37:23):
I completely agree with what Gustav said, but to look at this from a different frame, I think is that the founders lose hope. And when you and your heart is like, "Yeah, we're failing." I can see it when I'm meeting with a founder, when they resign themselves that they're failing versus. First is when like, "We got one more move in us. We got one more try." You can see in their eyes when they feel like there's more ideas or there's some last ditch Hail Mary thing. It doesn't always work, but it's almost like you have to not accept that you're going to fail. And as long as you don't accept that that's going to happen, there's usually a lot more moves you can try to save the company. Maybe it's to get profitable, maybe it's to do some other zany thing, maybe it's to launch a new product.

(00:38:17):
And so it's pretty rare, I would argue, that the cause of death is that they had lots of firepower and they were feeling really positive and they just ran out of money. That's actually more rare than founders think. It's much more common that they still have some money left. I'm not saying a lot, but some money and they're just like, "Yeah, I'm done. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to do this anymore." And again, fair enough. But do you get what I'm saying? I think founders are afraid that they're going to run out of money and that's why they're going to shut down. And it's way more common that their idea doesn't work and they have a big fight with their co-founder, and then they can't agree on what to work on, and then they just like, "I don't want to do this anymore." And they shut down. That is the most common cause of death, is something that sounds like that story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
That is so interesting. And again, this comes back to your core advice. Don't die. Just don't die. We talked about this already of just sometimes it's actually okay to die. And I guess just to refresh that lesson is if you're not having fun anymore, maybe it's okay-

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:16):
Yeah, you're out of ideas. You're like, "I'm done." If in your heart that you're done, you don't have to keep going through the motions. No one benefits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
And you've also seen enough cases now, you've shared a few of these where all hope was potentially lost, but they kept going and then they turned into a huge success story. And I think most people don't see those examples. I guess is there anything you can share just how often that happens, how often you see that turn around?

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:41):
I would argue that if we define it as the company had a near death experience where it was going poorly and the founders seriously wondered if it was all going to be over, a hundred percent of the time people go through that where the founder's like, "Yeah, I guess we're done. I guess we should pack it in." And at least you feel that way at some point in your startup journey, man, everyone goes through that. And again, there's gradations, people that actually truly got down to very, very hard situations. It's still a high percentage, maybe 50%. I mean, you can ask founders, there's a lot of founders that come this close to it all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:21):
That is really empowering, I imagine, for many founders hearing this of just knowing every single founder goes through, okay, I think it's actually over. Following on this real quick, the advice that Gustav shared, which is about talking to customers. I'm just going to keep trying to pull wisdom out of your head. Do you have any advice for just how to effectively talk to customers? We're always hearing, "Talk to customers. Build things they want." Easier said than done. You get a lot of asks. You get one customer asking for a lot of stuff. There's a big company that's like, "Build this thing, we'll pay a million dollars." Just do you have general guidance of just what to pay attention to and what to build versus avoid?

Dalton Caldwell (00:40:57):
Yeah, I think when I talked to aspiring founders about this a lot, they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I talked to customers. We get it. Cool." And I'm like, "Cool. Well, how many customers do you talk to?" And they're like, "Well." And they get really quiet. And so I think this is one of those things like, hey, you should have a healthy diet and exercise every day or whatever, where people know it and that doesn't mean they do it. And so I think to start with, you have to get out in the world and talk to people in person. And you can't just hide behind your keyboard and call that talking to customers. Right? I think a lot of folks, the inclinations are to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads and try to get people to sign up for something. And again, maybe that's something, but I think a lot of the reason people do that is they're just shy and they don't want to put themselves out there because it's a little awkward to go talk to people.

(00:41:49):
And you have to set yourself up to go out in the physical world, get people to meet with you, get them to take you seriously, show them a product you're building. And so again, it'd be very tactical here. You can do a self-assessment. In the past month, how many in-person physical meetings have I had with potential customers? Maybe you've done a lot, I don't know, listener, maybe you have, but it's shocking how many companies I talk to, they're like, "Well, we're focused on raising our pre-seed round before we talk to customers." Things like that. And again, I think the core, core thing going on is just social anxiety and looking stupid. And I think you just got to get past that. You just got to start doing it until it doesn't feel bad anymore. Think about how stupid the Airbnb founders must have felt. They were like, "Hey, you should rent out your house and I'm going to come and sleep in your house, and here's an airbag."

(00:42:51):
The whole thing is a little awkward, right? So you got power through the awkwardness of talking to people, and once you start doing it's actually fun. And so once you get used to overcoming this awkwardness, I think people do much better at talking to customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:08):
When someone does this self-evaluation, is there a heuristic that tells you this is enough? What do you look for? Is there a number? How many per week? How many per month?

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:17):
Yeah, I don't know if I know a good number. I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call, meeting with who, meeting with this person. And when the calendar is not that or it's all... Again, what you're actually doing is just buying ads to try to validate your idea, I don't think that's talking to customers. I think that's something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:46):
That's an awesome heuristic. So roughly fifth of your time at least should be talking to customers.

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:51):
Yeah. And again, it depends on the idea space you're working on. Some are more, some are less. So yeah, it should be a fair amount of time. And nothing substitutes for an actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):
Makes so much sense. So the Airbnb is a classic example of they went to New York and talked to their host and things like that. Is there another startup that comes to mind that did this really well, that found just a really cool way and hustle to talk to customers?

Dalton Caldwell (00:44:14):
Well, again, some of the companies we talked about, I mean, for Brex, they were just talking to other people in their batch and that worked extremely well. Same with Retool is they just sold it inside of the YC network. I think with Zip, they were just beasts at getting companies on calls with them to ask them about procurement. And I think they had way more than 20% of their time. When you looked at their calendars, oh man, they were talking to customers a lot to build their first product and pre-selling it before they built it. Same with PostHog I guess that's a different go to market. They launched this open source thing to start with and their calendars are filled with people that were trying to implement the first open source version of PostHog or were so excited about it.

(00:44:59):
And people on Hacker News were excited about it and they had this huge influx of people that were excited that PostHog existed and had lots of feedback and web reports. It wasn't always positive, but they never lacked for people that wanted to talk to them once they launched that, which was very helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):
On Zip, I actually have a lot of their story in one of my series on how to build a B2B startup. And what they did actually, as you know, is they just called, DMed people on LinkedIn and ask them for advice on, "Hey, we're trying to understand how you enjoy your current procurement products." And then they ended up being early beta testers. And I think they did hundreds of these. They just-

Dalton Caldwell (00:45:38):
Oh, yeah, no, it was a numbers game. They were just grinding at this. And so yeah, that was very good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):
The other classic YC stories, the Collison Collision, I think it's called or the-

Dalton Caldwell (00:45:47):
Collison Install.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):
Oh, Collison Install. Okay. Can you tell that story briefly?

Dalton Caldwell (00:45:53):
The Collison Install is what often happens with customers, is that they say, "Yes, I want you buy your product." And then they do not implement it, they just go quiet. There's no implementation and this is very bad if you're selling software to someone. If they never implement it, they're going to churn. You basically failed on the one yard line, okay? And so they developed this tactic to be like, "Oh, well, I'm at the neighborhood, I'll drop by your office to help you implement Stripe and just create..." Again, it was a little awkward like we talked about earlier, but you would be like, "Yeah. I'm in the neighborhood. How about I drop by?" And then they would show up and they'd be like, "Cool, cool. Can pull up your text editor?" "Oh yeah, cool. All right." "Hey, can I drive? Can I have the keyboard?"

(00:46:43):
And they would just install Stripe into the customer's website, smiling, being charming guys. And they'd be like, "Oh, that's cool. Okay. Well, can we roll out the website now?" And they basically would not go away until you finish the implementation of Stripe. And again, it was actually helpful because they were doing all this white glove service to get it implemented. That was very effective. And I think the takeaway from that story is even when you get a yes, you're not actually done with sales. You have to finish the last mile to get the thing implemented. And they were very good at that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:18):
That was an incredible story. And now they're, I don't know, a hundred billion in business and that's how it all begins.

Dalton Caldwell (00:47:24):
Yeah. I was an early Stripe customer at my startup and yeah, Patrick would... We used Google Talk at the time. Patrick would be sending me messages on a weekly basis just checking in. And so again, it's funny how successful these folks get, but yeah, Patrick was very hands-on with all of his customers and was extremely available. I can say that because I was one of them. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):
And I'm sure he had social anxiety going through all that. That wasn't a comfortable thing to do, just keep pushing people to install your software and deploy.

Dalton Caldwell (00:47:54):
Oh, surely not. If you want your startup to work, this is just what you got to do. Comes with the territory.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):
This is going to be just a way broad question and I don't know if you'll have an answer, but just are there other just patterns you find across startups that do well? This is maybe the $64 million question of just founders and what they do that ends up leading to success.

Dalton Caldwell (00:48:15):
I don't think personality types matter as much. I've seen very quiet people, very extroverted people. You name it. I've seen all sorts of personality types. So for me personally, I don't think there's a personality type that people should copy and be like, "I need to be like this person. I need to be Steve Jobs. I need to be Elon." I don't really believe in that because there's just so much variation. Tony from DoorDash is so different than a lot of folks, and Rujul is so different and Grant from Whatnot. These are all very, very different people. Patrick is a different kind of person. Ryan from Flexport. These are just very different personality types. But the thing that I would argue folks that build really big companies have in common is they just really want it and they really believe in themselves and they really believe they can make it work. And that they're somehow deep in their internal psyche, there's something that's like, "I'm the one and I won't accept this not working."

(00:49:26):
And even though objectively there's all this data coming in, this isn't working, this is bad. My employees want to quit, my executives want to quit. Whatever it is. Somewhere deep down in there, they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to make this work. This company is going to be big." And they just believe. And it's almost like that internal gravitational force inside of them is so large, it warps the world to bend to that will. And people start to believe it because they believe it so much and they convince their employees to believe in and they convince everyone around them that this is going to happen for them. And so again, this is not a personality trait. I'm arguing this is a core belief.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:10):
So interesting. And it connects so much to what we've been talking about. Just don't die. Don't lose hope in what you're working on. A founder hearing this might feel like, "Man, I don't know if I'm so convinced this is going to work." In your experience, how much of this is internally, they're so certain and convinced versus externally, they need to show this confidence?

Dalton Caldwell (00:50:31):
Well, I think it's internally they're convinced. Yeah, I'm not sure it's external. But, and this is the big but, no one has this at the early stages when they don't have a good idea and they don't have customers and it's objectively not working. And so again, I know a lot of founders are like, "Well, I don't feel that way. Oh no, maybe I'm an imposter and I shouldn't do a startup." Well, of course you don't feel that way if you haven't talked to any customers and haven't built a product. But what usually happens is you pivot to a good idea where you start with a good idea that you care about and customers you care about and you launch it. And the better the product does, the more obsessed you get with your own company.

(00:51:12):
I think in the case of Stripe, I don't want to tell Patrick's story for him, but I recall him saying at some point he wasn't as sure that Stripe was going to work until they were a year or two in. And then once it started working and then they really believed in it. But it wasn't like he woke up one day and like, "Stripe is the thing. It's going to work." I think you build conviction and you have this network effect virtual cycle where you get work conviction. The more customers reflect back to you and data reflects back to you that you're on the right track.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:45):
This is exactly what Scott Belsky shared in our episode when I asked him when to pivot is, do you have more conviction this is going to work or less conviction over time? And so I like that connection we just made there. Okay, so we've talked about all these way startups fail, bad ideas, tarpit ideas. I want to go to the flip side and talk about good startup ideas. So recently you put out a request for startups, which is essentially 20 categories of ideas that you want to fund, that YC wants to fund. Can you share some of these ideas that you're excited about? And basically you're looking to fund and looking for founders to work on.

Dalton Caldwell (00:52:21):
Yeah. And so we put out the request for startups just to inspire people to maybe apply with ideas that aren't the ones that we always see. It's not prescriptive like we will only fund ideas on this list. It is not that at all. Remember what I talked about earlier with information diet? We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating. There aren't currently. And so a couple of the ones that we put out there, I made one about ERPs which is enterprise resource planning software. And I did that because I get so few applications on that and they're usually pretty good. And I just would love to see more people look at that and learn about what the ERPs are, just because it's so rare that people apply with that. And now I have a feeling we're going to see a lot more applications working on that. And so it worked as intended, which is to introduce this idea space to founders that didn't even know what an ERP was. Now they'll go learn about it.

(00:53:16):
Another one is we'd like to fund open source companies. And so that's one of the RFSs where if more people apply to YC with open ideas, I think we'd be pretty excited about that. Maybe founders didn't realize that that would be something we want to fund. Same with space companies. Yeah, we've had a lot of success with space companies. Several of the folks that are actually going to space right now that aren't SpaceX or YC companies. And so I think sometimes founders feel like those ideas are too bold and ambitious, but no, I'd love if more people apply with space companies. And so think about it that way, where we're trying to put out of idea spaces that perhaps someone subconsciously filtered out as what might be a good startup idea. And hopefully that creates a new set of startup ideation for the person.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
And we're going to link to this page in the show notes for folks that want to explore. I'll give a couple more real quick. A way to end cancer, no big deal. Spatial computing, new defense technology, bringing manufacturing back to America. So a lot of hard science, deep tech stuff, which is maybe a new... I don't know. I imagine you guys have invested this in the past, but it feels like trend.

Dalton Caldwell (00:54:30):
We totally have, right? So these aren't like, "Oh, we've never invested in these before." It's more of like, "Hey, it'd be cool if we saw more applications along these lines." It would be nice because it currently feels a little bit under... There could be more startups working on this stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:46):
Yeah, instead of the tarpit ideas. A couple more real quick, better enterprise glue.

Dalton Caldwell (00:54:51):
Yeah, I like that idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):
Say more about that. What does that look like?

Dalton Caldwell (00:54:55):
The software to connect all these business systems is usually pretty brittle and janky, and there's been lots of good startups founded to solve this problem. I think there's still a lot more room for improvement and likely LLMs will improve. We'll probably be able to create better and better glue so all sorts of software systems can talk to each other. And so again, very broad idea. But yeah, I think we'll see a lot of very successful companies where that's the kernel of the idea they start with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):
Awesome. One last one. Small fine tune models as an alternative to gigantic generic ones. Yeah. Sweet. And so we'll include this link in the show notes and folks can click on each of these and there's a lot more explanation of what it is you're thinking about there. Awesome. Okay, just a couple more questions.

Dalton Caldwell (00:55:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:39):
One is just your background. So from what I've read, in the early 2000s, you were basically hanging out with some of the biggest success stories of today. Folks like Zuck and Reid Hoffman, Sam Altman, Elon, Sean Parker. This is before they really became anyone and they all became very successful. I'm curious just looking back at that, what you've noticed is consistent across these folks that ended up being really successful over time.

Dalton Caldwell (00:56:06):
Back in 2003, being in Silicon Valley and being interested in startups, it was a really small space. There just weren't that many people that were into this stuff. And so I remember I cold emailed Reid Hoffman when LinkedIn was 12 employees and he just responded and he's like, "Oh, let's have lunch." He was just a guy and everyone else that was doing, I guess you could call it social networking, that was the people that I knew. There was a few conferences you would go to and there'd be 30 people there. It reminds me of stories about the Homebrew Computer Club. I'm not saying this is as cool. But when I read stories about what it was like when the Homebrew Computer Club existed, it was a very small number of people that all knew each other that were real weirdo outsiders that were into this stuff, okay? And so that's what in the post.com boom Bay Area startup scene, that's legitimately what it felt like.

(00:57:03):
And so I didn't think a lot about the personality traits of these people. Again, they were all pretty different people, but what they had in common is the folks that are now the really big names just had a lot of staying power. Right? So when I met Sam, he had dropped out of Stanford to work on Loot, which is hilariously a way to find people around you to hang out with. An interesting theme here, huh? He was cool. He was this really young guy and he just did that. It wasn't huge. And then he got into other stuff and ended up working at YC, ended up getting involved in hard tech and has now reinvented himself as the big mind behind AI, which again, awesome. But if I think about who he was back in the day, yeah, he was a 23-year-old working on a thing for feature phones to find friends in your neighborhood.

(00:57:58):
Their customer was Boost Mobile. I bet you could go find the commercials for Loot that Boost Mobile put out on YouTube. Those are actually pretty funny. Have you seen those commercials?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:06):
No, but I'm going to go check them out.

Dalton Caldwell (00:58:07):
Anyway, it's pretty funny. So yeah, that's the real story. And then, yeah, I remember I was in downtown Palo Alto at the time, and some of the folks I was friends with were friends with Sean Parker, and this was actually before Sean Parker went to Facebook. He was part of Napster. And so one of my friends was like, "Oh, we need to get my friend a ride to the airport." And so I ended up giving Sean Parker a ride to the Oakland Airport. And again, what was he like? I don't know. He just basically sat in the back seat on the phone the whole time. But again, my point is I wasn't like, "Wow, these are going to be really big successful people that one day will be important in the world." It just felt like a bunch of nerds that really liked the internet and computers, doing things that they were interested in and were just obsessed with this.

(00:58:57):
They weren't like, "Gee, should I move to New York?" Or, "Maybe I should go to law school." It was people that were very bought in to staying working on internet companies. And so you'll see these folks just reinvent themselves multiple eras, right? Okay, like Reid Hoffman, he worked at PayPal, right? And then he did LinkedIn and then he was a VC. He's had all these different eras where it's the same person, but it's almost like a different figure, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:28):
There's a lot of interesting lessons there. One is that your career is long and you'll have the opportunity to do many things and you can continue to shift. In my example, this is my fourth career, I realized. I was an engineer, then a founder, then a product manager, now whatever this job is. And I think that's really common. I think the other, again, is the personality types point, which I didn't comment on, but I think it's so important that you can be super introverted and be super successful. You can be super extroverted and be very successful. And I think the key there is use your skills and strengths to achieve the same things. You don't have to be the amazing presenter on Steve Jobs type stage. You can do the same thing in a different way. And then the other point there is, again, coming back to you just need to be really excited and enjoy the work you're doing because that'll drive you forward and make you be successful. So I like that the story is a summary of so many of the things you've shared so far.

(01:00:21):
There's other two other fun stories, maybe pick one. The other one is you sold your startup to MySpace and your job was basically to save MySpace. And then the other is you're the reason Andreessen Horowitz missed out on Instagram and couldn't invest. So which of those would you want to share?

Dalton Caldwell (01:00:41):
Well, it's the same story. And the way that it's the same story is my second company... Basically, I sold my first company to MySpace. It was the music company that I worked on. And they recruited a new CEO who was formerly the COO of Facebook called Owen Van Natta. So again, hilariously part of the same little circle of people. And Owen was like, "Okay, we need to fix MySpace. Rupert Murdoch's got the juice. He wants me to fix it. We're going to do it. So come up with some ideas." And the best idea that I could come up with at the time was doing something around mobile photo sharing, something like Twitter, but for photos. And I figured with MySpace's user base, that would work pretty well. This was in 2010, so it was right as the App Store was getting big, and I had a lot of success in the App Store with imeem. It was one of the top downloaded music apps. And so I was like, "Wow, the App Store was really good." And I was really into apps being the thing.

(01:01:40):
And at this time, Facebook was a little early on. They were trying to do cross-platform mobile apps, if you recall. And their apps were not great. This was, again, ancient history. So that was my plan. And then immediately Owen Van Natta was fired, and so I didn't even really get onboarded. And so I just left. I think I worked in MySpace for a month because the person that acquired my company got fired and I think the whole word chart got fired. I didn't even know who to talk to. It was really great. It was a great experience. You know what I'm saying? I wasn't really sure who my point of contact was at that point. I don't think they knew either. It was just a mess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
Just message Tom.

Dalton Caldwell (01:02:19):
No, no. He was long gone. Seriously. I know you're kidding. But no, literally, I don't know who was left at that point. Tom was long gone. And so I was like, "Well, I should just do a new startup and I should work on something like what I was thinking about." And I ended up starting the company and quickly was able to raise an angel around because people remembered my company from the first one. And the major investor we had was Andreessen Horowitz. This is one of their first board seat investments, like Marc Andreessen was on my board. And again, I have my own set of stories about that, but it was interesting experience and we launched it in... I think we got half a million or a million users. You can go find tech print articles about it. We launched on Android and iOS and it was mobile photo sharing, and actually it was growing pretty well. Okay?

(01:03:11):
And then what happened is there was another portfolio company called Bourbon, which was originally a ForceWare clone that was built by these two guys. And they decided to pivot out of that and into what... Which was pretty similar to my thing. Again, fair enough, that's just how this works. And they did something smart. Again, this is just me talking, I don't know what their version of the story is. But what I think they did that was smart is if you looked on the paid app store charts, the number one app was Hipstamatic and Hipstamatic cost money. And what do we know about what people want? They want things that are free that cost money, right? And so they basically built a pretty legitimate knockoff of the Hipstamatic filters, combining it with a social graph, and they launched it and it pretty quickly took off. So of course this is Instagram, right? And so it took off really quickly and that was a wild experience for me to be like, "Oh, this seems familiar."

(01:04:07):
And basically because Andreessen Horowitz had invested in my company, was on the board, even though they were investors in Instagram, that was a conflict and they didn't do the deal. And then for whatever reason, this became a big source of Silicon Valley gossip, which was like, "Wow, I can't believe this happened." And so it was just a really weird experience for me as a founder to be right in the middle of something that became culturally so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):
I imagine there's a bullseye in your back from a16z for a little bit.

Dalton Caldwell (01:04:42):
Oh, I don't actually think they care. I don't think they held it against me because what did I do wrong?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):
It's true.

Dalton Caldwell (01:04:50):
I started a company. You know what I'm saying? Obviously there was some frustration, but I was guy who had a company that they invested in. I don't know. I didn't feel didn't much higher for them. I think this is just how life works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):
Yeah. I wonder if they changed their conflict policies after that at all.

Dalton Caldwell (01:05:10):
I don't think so. I think this has happened multiple other times, but those aren't my stories to tell.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
And by the way, I don't know if you mentioned the name of your startup, it was called PicPlz, right?

Dalton Caldwell (01:05:21):
Yeah, it's called PicPlz. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:21):
Great. Okay. So for the final phase before we get to very exciting lighting round, I have these two segments, recurring segments. I have failure corner and contrarian corner. We can do both or we can pick one or the other. Failure corner, share a story of a time in your career where you failed and when you learned from that experience. Contrarian corner, what's something you believe that most other people don't believe?

Dalton Caldwell (01:05:45):
Yeah, I think for contrarian corner, I know where I would start and I think it's relevant for your listener. I think this is relevant to this and you could argue this isn't contrary, but here's what I think. I think growth and growth hacking and doing all this analytics, A/B testing stuff, is a total waste of time for very early startups. And that one of the weird things about having lots of startup advice on the internet, again, this is one of the reasons we started making videos at YC, is a lot of the advice was catered towards later stage companies. Like, "Oh, here's how you set up your board and here's how you motivate your sales team." It was all aimed at series A, series B founders, and not for seed stage founders. The problem was seed stage founders would consume all the later stage advice and get really confused.

(01:06:35):
And so the anti-pattern I see is there are lots of founders that are very familiar with your awesome work, which again, I really recommend, I like it. But when you have no customers and you're reading Lenny's guides on how to set up split testing and how you did growth at Airbnb, oh man, that is so dumb. That is so not helpful. And so you see this inclination away from getting a first customer, getting one customer and talking to that person, and instead they have all this really complex growth hacking theory. I think this also happens if you worked in big tech where your product already has scale. And so if you work at Facebook and your job is to launch new little features, yeah, of course you should make heavy use of analytics and A/B testing and split testing and feature flags. Yeah, yeah, yeah, makes sense. But when you have no users, what are you doing? So do you think that's contrary? What do you think? I'm just trying to argue this advice applied to a startup that's too early is actively not helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):
I think it's contrarian for many people. 100%. I also 100% agree with it. It makes me feel like I need to, at the top of my post, share here's who this is for. If you're earlier than this, ignore it. If you're later than this, ignore it.

Dalton Caldwell (01:07:49):
I mean, again, I'm not saying you do anything wrong, but imagine if the OG Airbnb founders took all of your current advice and applied it when they had four users and they knew their names and they were trying to run complicated growth hacking split testings.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:03):
Yeah. Maybe just to clarify when you talk about growth hacking. So obviously when you're starting something, say a consumer app, you need to get a bunch of users somehow. What's your sense of just when you say don't do this sort of thing, but this is okay? What falls in those buckets?

Dalton Caldwell (01:08:20):
I think it depends on the idea. I think in the case of Whatnot, it was consumer app and they needed to get users. But they were very intellectually honest on the metrics for how you get a marketplace off the ground. And they didn't just go dump all their money into Instagram ads. They effectively knew they needed to focus on buyers and on the buy side and build momentum on the buy side. They really understood marketplaces. And so for consumer, I think it's having a sophisticated view of how you get the consumer company off the ground. I think if you look at the Facebook story, them getting a hundred percent penetration on the Harvard campus first instead of launching overall. Again, good strategy, would recommend that strategy. So again, the way to extrapolate that is know what your comps are of what companies you... Or type is, and then look at what they did on the zero to one and ignore what they do today. Right?

(01:09:20):
Don't pay attention to what Facebook does today if you're a brand new startup founder, pay attention to Facebook when they were getting their first thousand users. What were those tactics?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
I feel like this should be its own episode where we just go into how to get your first thousand users. I know there's a video actually we'll link to that Gustav made with YC's advice on how to get your users. Did you want to visit failure corner or not? Or shall we move on?

Dalton Caldwell (01:09:43):
I failed at tons of stuff. As an investor, I make lots of bad investments as well as good ones. I think in my startups I pivoted a lot and a lot of things I did didn't work out. And so again, I just gave you a specific story with PicPlz, right? You just heard a specific story there. I guess what I learned is that you just can't let it get to you too much and you got to keep going. And that if you keep going, no one really remembers those as much and it doesn't really define you. Fear of failure shouldn't dominate all of your thoughts. And instead you should use your energy and positivity to keep trying to do good work, right? Because back in the day, if I would've been like, "Well, I guess startups aren't for me, I guess tech isn't for me." I wouldn't have had a career doing any of this stuff. I wouldn't be working at YC, I wouldn't be advising companies, right?

(01:10:36):
So I always had to have in my life a lot of optimism and energy and use that energy and motor to keep me going. And it served me really well, right? Even if lots of stuff I tried didn't work and continue to not work. Again, obvious stuff I know, but yeah, that doesn't mean it's not true, even though it's obvious.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:58):
I feel like that's a recurring theme here and I love that it's another version of just how not to die. There's the startup itself that shouldn't die, and then there's your just drive and motivation to keep going and try new things when things don't work out. I love all the recurring themes and messages for people here. Dalton, is there anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Dalton Caldwell (01:11:20):
Yeah, I guess the final thought is if someone wants to do a startup and doesn't know where to start, just to give you permission to talk to potential customers and try to pre-sell something before you write code and have those conversations. I think so many folks don't know where to begin on starting a startup, and my tactical advice is start doing customer validation first versus building a PowerPoint deck, versus trying to raise money versus all these other things. I think a lot of people don't use that strategy, and basically if you find people that are really excited and you do line up customers, that is a great green light that it is time to do a startup, right? That can get you down the path. So yeah, I think that's my final advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:09):
And then with that, when does the building come in? Is it build it while you're talking, build it before you... It depends on basically-

Dalton Caldwell (01:12:15):
Build it once you have some conviction and then you're like, "Oh, I think I would have a customer. I think that at least one person would use this thing I want to build. At least one."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:23):
I love it. I love the simplicity and pragmatism of all of your advice. Dalton, welcome to the very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Dalton Caldwell (01:12:33):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:34):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Dalton Caldwell (01:12:38):
I think a lot of founders are afraid of doing sales and they don't know how to do sales, and they think they need these really experienced sales coaches and they need all this training, and I'll be like, "Well, go on to Amazon and find the most popular sales books like Getting to Yes that everyone reads, and just read those and that'll get you 80% of the way there." You know what I'm saying? They want to hire someone for millions of dollars to give them sales coaching. I'm like, "Well, have you read these really basic sales books?" And they're like, "No." And so I think that's a low cost way to go on Amazon, Getting to Yes and a few other of the top sellers, I forget the names, and just read those, and that is your crash course on how to be great at sales.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:16):
Awesome. There's also this book called Founding Sales that I imagine you're familiar with. Pete Kazanjy was on the podcast talking about that and that's something I always recommend because it's just like, "How founders can do sales."

Dalton Caldwell (01:13:26):
Start there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):
Start there. Great. We'll link to that. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Dalton Caldwell (01:13:33):
This may be warping what you're asking for, but I like to watch old shows a lot, and so I keep rewatching The Sopranos and the Wire, and it always is different to me every time and things like that. I think here's a silly answer. I've been really enjoying watching old episodes of Columbo, which was a television show from the '70s and '80s. I don't know why, I don't even know if this is destructive, but for some reason, I'm really into that right now. It's very old episodes of Columbo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
You're an old soul, Dalton.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:01):
I guess. I don't know. It just feels like a time machine to a different time when I watch these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:06):
Definitely, maybe one of the most unique answers yet.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:10):
Fair enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:11):
Columbo.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:12):
Well, again, I guess I'm not trying to give you an answer where I sound super clever-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:15):
No, I love this.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:16):
I'm telling you the real answer. So that's actually what I'm watching.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:19):
It does actually sound very sophisticated and clever. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask, I guess founders in this context?

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:28):
I don't really believe in trick questions, and I think I just start with, "Hey, so tell me about what you're working on." Or, "What have you learned since you started?" Again, none of these are trick questions, but I think you can get the most honest and interesting answers by asking the most straightforward basic things and having that be a blank slate for their answers to draw on. You know what I'm saying? So I like the most simple prompts and let them take the conversation where they want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:56):
I know this probably is a very big question, but just what do you look for in their answer that gives you a sense of this is a good or bad answer?

Dalton Caldwell (01:15:05):
For YC interviews?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:05):
Yeah. And I know this is its own podcast episode.

Dalton Caldwell (01:15:08):
I think evidence that they actually have thought about it. As per I said earlier, that they've done research, that they have opinions, that they care about it. Right? Sometimes when people answer questions, you can just tell that it's really superficial, and they haven't put much care or soul into their answers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:31):
Awesome. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Dalton Caldwell (01:15:35):
I like my Oura ring and my Apple Watch and all that good stuff. I've been a fan. There's a YC clinic called SiPhox, S-I-P-H-O-X, I just sign up for, and they do at-home blood testing. And basically I'm trying to sync that at-home blood testing thing into all my other devices. I don't know. I really enjoy all the stuff that Apple and other startups are working on and YC companies are working on around personal health. And so yeah, those are products I'm into.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:05):
SiPhox. Okay. And wait, then you do a needle and stuff and you take your own blood?

Dalton Caldwell (01:16:09):
It's this little tiny needle. It doesn't hurt at all. It takes a few drops of blood and you do it at home and you mail it in and then it has all these blood tests. It's actually really cool. Yeah. It was one of those cases where I saw it and then I later was like, "Oh, wait, that's a YC company." Basically, I became a customer and was pleasantly surprised that it's a YC company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
And I think I found it. So it's S-I-P-H-O-X health dot com.

Dalton Caldwell (01:16:38):
Yeah, it really rolls off the tongue, right? Yeah, that's the name of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):
Very cool. Okay, I see the little needle. Okay, great. Go SiPhox. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life, share with friends?

Dalton Caldwell (01:16:55):
Just check in with yourself that you're having fun and that you enjoy what you're doing. And if you don't, you should probably make a change, whatever that is. And again, if you're a founder, you're in control, right? You can change your own company. But I think a lot of people go through life and they don't ask themselves this question, am I having fun? Am I enjoying? Do I value what I'm spending my time on? And I think that you just can go back to this over and over and over again as a good prompt on how to decide what to do with your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:29):
Easier said than done to change that in many cases, but it always starts with realizing, okay, this isn't actually what I-

Dalton Caldwell (01:17:35):
Yeah, and bidding to yourself. Yeah, I'm not really enjoying this, and then trying to be like, "Well, how can I fix it?" Having that conversation with yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):
Yeah. It reminds me of a Steve Jobs quote where you wake up day after day, it's okay to wake up some days being like, "I don't want to be doing this." But if it's every day and continues to happen, then that's a sign you should change it.

Dalton Caldwell (01:17:53):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:54):
Final question. You and Michael Seibel have been doing this incredible podcast together. If somebody wanted to check out the podcast and dive in, is there an episode that you love most that you think they could start with?

Dalton Caldwell (01:18:05):
It depends. Some of the episodes are more for folks that already have a startup and they're dealing with problems. I don't know. Some of the episodes about investors or things like that. It's very clear that the audience for those is current startup founders. And there's a lot that are just more life advice, how to make decisions and think about. And those have strangely become very popular and gotten a lot of views with non-startup founders, which is a pleasant surprise. And so I'd recommend those for folks in the audience that are not currently startup founders. I don't know. Life tips from top founders, I think is a good-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:41):
Oh, from billionaires? Is it that one?

Dalton Caldwell (01:18:43):
Yeah, yeah. I think that was pretty popular. So what I'd be looking for is diagnose, am I a current founder and I have founder problems? Or am I just looking for general philosophy type questions? And I really like those philosophy ones. We have one for high school students, the audience is, here's advice for high school students that are interested in startups. Here's some tips that you should be thinking about. Again, pretty narrow target audience, but I love that episode because we're really trying to speak directly to that audience and I think it's pretty good advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:13):
Dalton, you are wonderful. Thank you for sharing so much wisdom. This is action packed. I'm really excited for founders to listen to this. I think it's going to make a big dent in a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on some of this? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Dalton Caldwell (01:19:27):
I am on Twitter/X.com and Dalton.C is my username. And also my LinkedIn is pretty good. It's pretty popular. I don't know. Just search for my name on LinkedIn. And yeah, I'd love to see you all there. And then how can folks be helpful? I mean, honestly, it's just great when folks want to apply to YC and do a startup. And so feel free to dive into other videos and apply to YC. And something that's really special about my job is I get the privilege of getting to fund companies that they already know me from videos and they're shocked that I'm exactly the same as... Effectively, they're like, "Wow, you're just that guy from the videos I've been watching, and it's so cool that you're just exactly like you seem in the videos." And so basically, yeah, if people like what I have to say and they like the videos and apply to YC, I would love to fund their companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):
Dalton, thank you so much for being here.

Dalton Caldwell (01:20:24):
Sure thing. Thanks so much, Lenny. Appreciate it.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
The business you're building, the team you're building, the way you're operating is the very bleeding edge of how companies are trying to operate in this AI era.

Dan Shipper (00:00:07):
We have a head of AI operations. She's just constantly building prompts and building workflows that I and everyone else on the team are just automating as much as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What are some things that you believe about AI that most people don't?

Dan Shipper (00:00:20):
I hate the headlines that are like, "Entry-level jobs are taken away by AI." Whenever I see a kid with ChatGPT, I'm like, "Holy shit, they're going to go so much faster than any other person that I've worked with." We have this guy, he made a year's worth of progress in two months because every time I sat down with him and told him, "Okay, here's how you tell a story, here's how you think about a headline," he recorded all of it, put it into a prompt, and he never made the same mistake twice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
There's this sense we're getting to a place where you don't have to write any code, you have a product team not writing code at all.

Dan Shipper (00:00:46):
No one is manually coding anymore. Organizations like ours, people who are playing at the edge, we're doing things that, in three years, everybody else is going to be doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
Today, my guest is Dan Shipper. Dan is the co-founder and CEO of Every, which is a company that is at the very bleeding edge of what is possible with AI. Their team of just 15 employees has built and shipped four different products. They publish a daily newsletter, and they have a consulting arm that helps companies adopt the latest AI best practices. On their product team, their engineers don't handwrite a single line of code and instead use an arsenal of agents who help them craft requirements and build their products.

(00:01:22):
Their editorial arm uses AI to publish better work faster, and they even have a person whose entire job is to help every employee at the company become more efficient using the latest AI workflows. In our conversation, Dan shares a bunch of tactics that they use internally to increase the leverage of their own employees, his personal AI tool stack, the one predictor that he's found for whether a company will successfully find huge productivity gains through AI, how he's building his company in a really unique way, a bunch of predictions for where AI is going, and so much more.

If you're an engineering leader or on a platform team, at some point, your CEO will inevitably ask you for productivity metrics.

(00:03:24):
But measuring engineering organizations is hard, and we can all agree that simple metrics like the number of PRs or commits doesn't tell the full story. That's where DX comes in. DX is an engineering intelligence solution designed by leading researchers, including those behind the DORA and SPACE frameworks. It combines quantitative data from developer tools with qualitative feedback from developers to give you a complete view of engineering productivity and the factors affecting it.

Dan Shipper (00:04:11):
Thank you for having me. I've obviously been a huge fan for a long time and so it's an honor to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:16):
It's my honor, Dan. I feel like this is a podcast that was meant to be. I'm so happy we're finally doing this. There's so damn much that I want to talk about; there's so damn much we can talk about. I thought it'd be fun to start with just some hot takes.

(00:04:29):
And the reason I want to start here is I feel like you spend more time thinking about AI, building with AI, using AI, evaluating AI than anyone else I know nearly. And so I really respect your insights and your perspectives on where things are going. So let me just ask you this question and see where this goes. What are some things that you believe about AI using AI tools that most people don't believe?

Dan Shipper (00:04:55):
I'm going to go with my hottest take, and this is the take that I have the least evidence for. So let's just start with that. I have other more well-reasoned takes to give you, but this is my hottest one, which is I think that AI may be one of the biggest force for reshoring American jobs. And so I think everyone is worried about it unemploying people. And for sure, it will change the skills needed to do the jobs that you're doing, but I think it may actually reshore a lot of jobs, and it'll do that in two ways.

(00:05:27):
One is, there are a lot of expensive services that rich people and big companies are paid for right now, so in-house counsel or call center or whatever. And what cheap intelligence does is it makes those kinds of things affordable for small companies and individuals. So it stimulates demand. The other thing that it does is it allows people who are in those jobs to serve more people cheaply. It may not get rid of customer service, for example, but it may allow 10 people in the Midwest, who would normally be working at a call center, to serve hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Maybe that's too much, but a lot more people than they would ordinarily if they were the ones on the phone all the time.

(00:06:22):
And so it becomes much more cost-effective for American companies to hire people in the US. And I think the people in the US are going to be better, in a lot of cases, at using these AI tools to do work. So I think it may actually make it more effective to have those jobs in the US run by people sitting in the US who are using it to get work done. And also, the model companies are here too. So there's a lot of American stuff happening, and you can decide whether or not you think that's a good thing, but I think it's quite lost in the conversation over whether AI will get rid of jobs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):
I like optimistic takes about AI, so this is great. And to your point, TBD if this is good for other countries, but good for the US. What else? What else you got? What other hot takes?

Dan Shipper (00:07:10):
Okay. Another big hot take, and this is less contrarian and more just, I think, people are truly sleeping on it. I think people are truly sleeping on how good Claude Code is for non-coders. And I'll extend this to not just Claude Code, but Google just came out with the Gemini CLI command-line interface. So things like that. And I'll tell you for people who are listening that don't know what Claude Code is. Claude Code is just the command-line interface. It's those black terminals that programmers use. It's a command-line interface that you can boot up. It has access to your file system, it knows how to use any kind of terminal command and it knows how to browse the web, all that kind of stuff.

(00:07:47):
You can give it something to do and it will go off and it'll run for 20 or 30 minutes and complete a task autonomously, agentically. Especially with Claude Opus 4 that just came out, it's this gigantic leap forward in AI's ability to work by itself. And Claude Code can even spawn multiple sub-agents that do a bunch of tasks in parallel and it's incredibly useful for programmers. Everybody inside of Every is using it all day, every day. Everyone's agent-pilled. They've got 15 agents doing all this kind of stuff. It's crazy.

(00:08:18):
But non-programmers don't use it because it's intimidating to use the terminal. But for example, you can download all your meeting notes and put it in a folder and just be like, "Okay, I want you to read every single one of my meeting notes and tell me..." Something that I do, for example, is, "Tell me all the time that I subtly avoided conflict."

(00:08:38):
And it writes a little to-do list for itself. It can have a little notebook, it can go and read each little thing and then write into its notebook, go down its to-do list and give you a summarized answer over multiple turns. So it's not just stuffing everything into context, which is what you'd be doing with ChatGPT chat or a regular Claude chat. It's actually processing every single file that you give it. And so I think it's incredibly powerful for any kind of task that involves processing a lot of text.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:06):
So as a simple way to think about this, you basically have an agent on your local computer that can read your local files and do your bidding.

Dan Shipper (00:09:14):
Yes, exactly. And it can do that for long amounts of time without going off the rails.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Interesting. And so there's a small hurdle that non-technical people have to overcome, which is using their terminal and giving commands, but once they get it running, it's just you talk to it in English and ask it to do stuff.

Dan Shipper (00:09:32):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:33):
So the hot take here is just Claude Code, which most people think is for engineers, is the most underrated tool for non-technical people.

Dan Shipper (00:09:42):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):
What are some other ways you imagine people seeing this? This meeting note example is really cool and I could see people using this. What else have you seen or thinking about?

Dan Shipper (00:09:52):
Something that I've done a lot, so I'm a writer for a lot of my job. And I know you're going to ask me about books I love, so I'm going to give you a sneak peek, which is I love War and Peace. I just read it for the third time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:03):
Wow, that's a long book.

Dan Shipper (00:10:06):
It's so long, but it's so good. I think Tolstoy is a brilliant writer. And one thing that I wanted to do is I was like, "I want to inflect some of my writing with some of Tolstoy's style." And the way I did that is I think he's incredible at these little subtle sentences where he shows you what a character is thinking and feeling just by how they behave, how they move their face or the mismatch between the intonation in their voice and the expression in their eyes, all that kind of stuff. He's just an incredible student of human behavior and psychology.

(00:10:36):
And so I just downloaded War and Peace to my computer, which you can do because it's public domain. And then I had Claude read the first three chapters of War and Peace and pull out all of those descriptions, and then make a guide for itself for how to do character descriptions like Tolstoy. And you could totally do this with a regular Opus command, but you couldn't put all of War and Peace into it. It would take a lot more hand holding to get it to do this. And it just did this by itself without my really intervening.

(00:11:05):
I had it download a Russian version of War and Peace and the English version, and then start comparing different scenes that I love to tell me about things that I might've missed in the translations, so that you can get as deep and weird and nerdy for whatever subfield you care about as you want to. Same thing for if you've got tons of customer interviews or tons of customer data you want to go through, it's incredibly powerful for going and figuring stuff out from big data sets like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
You actually inspired me to use... This is not what you're describing, but it's also something that's very cool. This is going to sound so nerdy. I'm reading Anna Karenina right now.

Dan Shipper (00:11:40):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:41):
Also Tolstoy. And this is recommended by a previous podcast guest. And so I was like, "All right, I got to read this." Also very long. I'm on my Kindle, I'm just like, "All right, 13% in, I've been reading for months."

Dan Shipper (00:11:52):
Hot take, I think War and Peace is better than Anna Karenina, especially for a tech person. But they're both good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
Okay, there we go. There's my year. I saw you tweet this use case that I love that I've been using, which is just while I'm reading, having ChatGPT voice sitting around and then just asking it questions. Because you don't actually have to feed it the book, it knows the whole book. And Anthropic just shared this. I don't know if they shared or someone found this in their legal briefings that they actually bought tons of books and scanned them themselves, is how they did fair use.

(00:12:23):
And so it has all this context. So just sitting there and asking it, "What the heck is this thing in Russian society?" is super fun. Okay, so this is awesome. So the tip here is just coming back to your hot take. The tip is you basically can have an agent using local files and doing all kinds of cool stuff on your computer versus having to upload it into projects or into your prompts and things like that. Super cool. So the bet here is that people are going to discover this and start using this just day to day.

Dan Shipper (00:12:53):
I think they absolutely will. And I also think probably the model companies are going to start making this more accessible. I think one of the things that will just come from Claude Code and other things like it into everything else you use, whether it's on the web or wherever, is all of the original AI apps were pasting a chat box into an existing UI. So you've got Copilot, it's got the auto-complete in the IDE. You've got Cursor, it's got a little sidebar with a little chat. And the difference with Claude Code is you never look at the code. It's not meant for coding, it's not meant for coding by hand.

(00:13:34):
It's meant for you to say, "I want you to get something done," and it goes and does it. And I think we're just getting to a point where for pretty much all the usual applications, AI is going to be good enough that we can get rid of the interfaces more or less where you're digging into all the things that it's actually doing and you're interleaved with its execution and you're more just like, "I'm delegating, it's going to go do it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:58):
Yeah. I had Cursor's CEO, Michael Truell, on the podcast, and this is his big vision is, "What comes after code?"

Dan Shipper (00:14:05):
English.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:06):
Exactly. Exactly. I also just had the founder of Base44 on the podcast who built this company, sold for 80 million bucks to Wix. And he shared that he's been around for six months, the company. For the last three months, he hasn't touched a single line of front-end code, all Cursor and other tools he's using. So this is happening.

Dan Shipper (00:14:27):
Same thing for people inside of Every, no one is manually coding anymore.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:32):
Okay. Definitely need to talk about that. Before we do, any other hot takes that you want to throw out there?

Dan Shipper (00:14:38):
I have one other hot take, which is I have a definition for AGI. And so AGI is famously hard to define. What does it mean for it to be artificial general intelligence? The Turing test was one, but we'd pretty much blown past the Turing test in a lot of ways. So we have no good one. And so what I have noticed is that you can tell how much better AI is getting by how long a leash you can give it to do work.

(00:15:09):
So with Copilot, you can tab complete and that was the beginning. With ChatGPT, you ask it a question and it returns a response and that's maybe slightly better than a tab complete. And then now with Claude Opus 4 and Gemini and all that kind of stuff, also with deep research, it can go off and work for 20 or 30 minutes. So that leash is getting longer where you have to intervene.

(00:15:34):
And I was thinking about this and it reminded me of Winnicott, who was a child psychologist. He wrote this book called Playing & Reality. And his conceptualization for what it means to become an adult, what it means to go from being an infant to a child to an adult is when you're first born, you're effectively fused with usually your mother, your caregiver. There's no difference between you and her or you and whoever your caregiver is.

(00:16:02):
And growing up is this process of being gradually let down in certain moments where you can handle being let down. So you learn that there's a separation between you and your caregiver. So for infants, it's instead of being fused at the hip for every hour of every day, you get left alone. Maybe you get left alone to cry it out. Who knows if that's the right thing to do with infants? A lot of consternation there. But that's teaching you that there's a separation between you and your mom or you and your dad. There's not going to always be someone to pick you up.

(00:16:38):
And raising a child is about knowing when they're ready to be let down a little bit and have to stand up on their own. So I think there's that same leash with human development. You get longer and longer periods of time where you can be on your own. So we're still in the 20 to 30 minutes is maybe... I don't know, you probably can't leave a toddler alone for 20 or 30 minutes, but it's a little bit older than a toddler.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:02):
Maybe 20, 30 seconds.

Dan Shipper (00:17:06):
With a toddler, you can be in the same room but not interacting with them every single second for 20 minutes sometimes. So it's around there. I think we have that similar leash with AGI. And so I think a good definition of AGI is when does it become economically profitable for people to run agents indefinitely? So it just never turns off. It's a Claude Code that's always running, it's always doing something, you just never turn it off, and you don't need to because you know that it's worthwhile to keep it on.

(00:17:41):
It's never waiting for you to be like, "Okay, next thing." It'll always respond to you when you're like, "Okay, next thing." But it's off just essentially living its life like a teenager and that is profitable for you. You'd rather have it do that than just wait for you to tell it what to do next.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:56):
Interesting.

Dan Shipper (00:17:56):
I think that's a good definition of AGI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
The profitable piece is also just the cost of running that thing and having it.

Dan Shipper (00:18:02):
It's partly the cost and partly the value. And obviously, you can game this a little bit and be like, "Cool, I'm just going to tell Claude to run in a loop forever." But I'm talking about more than that, more widespread adoption of agents that work all the time. And I like the profitable thing, because if it costs a little bit of money and the bar is profitability, it has to actually be doing something useful for you to keep it on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:29):
It's interesting how the metaphor of a senior employee and autonomy and essentially the more autonomous they are, the less instruction you have to give, the less reviews you have to do, is also just directly correlated with how senior they are.

Dan Shipper (00:18:44):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
Okay, great. Anything else along these lines?

Dan Shipper (00:18:48):
I have plenty of them. I hate the headlines that are like, "It's going to replace jobs," or "It's going to unemploy two thirds of the workforce." I don't think that's true. I hate headlines that are like, "You don't use your brain when you use ChatGPT," or another good headline is, "Doctors alone, doctors plus AI, or just AI, which one is better? AI is better, therefore, doctors are going to be outmoded."

(00:19:18):
All that stuff is, I think, pretty dumb. So for the doctors plus AI example, I think it's important to recognize that using AI is a skill. And so if you study doctors in a vacuum that don't really have a lot of experience with AI, you could probably create a situation such that it's better to just use an AI. And sometimes it is going to be better. But there's so many contexts that doctors need to make decisions and do things that it's really hard to take one study and make any conclusion about that.

(00:19:52):
And it's especially hard when you're dealing with a technology that's developing so rapidly that doctors can't really be expected to be experts at it yet. But I would guess in five or 10 years, that will be totally and completely different. For the student example or the "AI turns your brain off" example, I think it's really important to understand that in the history of technology, it has always been the case that you give up certain skills in order to get other ones. For example, Plato is famously very skeptical of writing because he thought it would harm your memory. And it did. We don't remember things quite as well as they did back in the day because they had to remember long epic poems to entertain each other.

(00:20:37):
But I think writing is a worthwhile trade for having a slightly worse memory. And I think something similar is going on with AI where you may be slightly less engaged in certain tasks, but if you use it right, you're going to be way more engaged in other tasks where you have much more power. And so you can construct a study that says brain connectivity goes down when you use AI in the same way that you could construct a study that says people's memory are worse when they have writing skills. But I don't think anyone would want to go back to a world where no one was literate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):
That is super interesting. There's all these studies that are showing the benefits of AI to students with these studies in Nigeria and just how fast people progress. So I think it's really important, this context you're sharing that you will lose some things, but the hope is the gain is much higher, and so far it seems like it will be.

Dan Shipper (00:21:27):
Yeah. I think people always, especially at the beginning of a tech hype cycle or a revolution paradigm shift, it's always easy to underestimate how quickly things are going to change. And the example I always use is, I live in Brooklyn and the tailor down the street from me doesn't accept credit cards. Credit cards have been around for a long time, so it takes a long time for technology like this to be adopted even in the best case.

(00:21:55):
And I think it's really easy to underestimate how complex specific contexts are that humans know how to deal with. And just because you can get a really good score on a test... It's incredible. I love AI, it's so incredible, but it doesn't actually give you an intuition for how difficult it is to actually be replacing specific parts of work or activities that you would do. I think a really good thing to give you maybe a little bit of an intuition for it is I built this thing over a weekend a month ago that was, "0.3, can it predict what I'm going to say in a meeting?"

(00:22:45):
That's a benchmark. It's the CEO benchmark. And the reason I did that is because the gold standard for OpenAI for testing how powerful a model is, is they test it on their internal code base. So they say, "How good is the new model at predicting what comes next in our internal code base?" Because that's not anywhere out on the internet. So it's a really good benchmark for that. And so I was like, "Well, my meeting transcripts aren't anywhere on the internet. A lot of what I say is on the internet and there's some overlap, but it'd be interesting."

(00:23:19):
And so I ran a bunch of the frontier models on this, on just my Granola transcripts, and they're pretty bad. They are pretty bad, and it's not because they're not smart. There's this real push now. Tobi from Spotify coined this term called "context engineering," which is getting the context to the model, the right context at the right time, is at least half the performance.

(00:23:43):
And I think that's 100% true. It's something that I've been writing about for three years. At the time, I called it knowledge orchestration. I think context engineering is probably a better term. But it's totally true, and that's a very, very hard problem to solve. It's not just a one- shot problem where it's gigantic context window and we're done. It's going...

Dan Shipper (00:24:00):
... that problem, where it's like gigantic context window and we're done. I think it's going to get better over time, but the minute it gets good at predicting what I'm going to say next in a meeting, I'm just going to use it as a tool, and that's going to change the entire dynamic of what I say next in a meeting. So it's not as easy as it seems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:18):
Interesting. I imagine you can build a GPT from that. And then, instead of having a meeting with Dan now, just talk to this thing, and he'll make decisions.

Dan Shipper (00:24:26):
Yes, definitely. And I mean we do this a little bit. It's not the same as being able to predict exactly what I'm going to say in a meeting. But I think if you're a CEO, or founder, or manager, it's really stunning how much of your job is just repeating yourself. And that is one of the best things about this AI, particularly AI revolution, is that you don't have to repeat yourself.

(00:24:48):
And so we had it last quarter. I tend to set one or two quarterly goals. And one of my big goals for us last quarter was don't repeat yourself. So I don't want ever say the same thing in a meeting twice, if I can help it. So for us, at Every, one of the big parts of Every is we have a daily newsletter. And I'm spending a lot of time giving feedback on headlines, or giving feedback on, "How do you write an intro," or "Is this idea any good," that kind of stuff.

(00:25:15):
And we've started to codify all of that into prompts that basically... It's not the same as mimicking me. It can't exactly say exactly what I'm going to say in a meeting, but it pushes my taste out to the edge so that writers who are not able to talk to me, by the time I see it, they've already talked to some simulation of a simulation of me. And that's incredibly powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
Let's follow this thread. This is exactly where I want it to go. I feel like the business you're building, the team you're building, the way you're operating is the very bleeding edge of how companies will operate and are trying to operate in this AI era. You guys are trying to be super AI-first. And it's super aligned with just so much of your writing. There's just so much reason to study what you guys are doing. So-

Dan Shipper (00:26:04):
Well, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):
Yes. And this is benefiting all of us, so thank you. So first of all, just tell people what the heck Every is, and then share a few insights into just how you operate. It's funny that you laugh at [inaudible 00:26:20] whatever you say.

Dan Shipper (00:26:20):
Everyone asks that because it's a very weird shape of a company. You can actually see other companies that have this shape from earlier eras, but it's less common. It doesn't make as much sense.

(00:26:33):
And I think it's newly enabled by AI, and we can talk about why. But the way that I typically talk about Every is we do ideas and apps at the edge of AI. So the core of the business is we have a daily newsletter. We've been doing it for about five years. We have about 100,000 subscribers. All of the people from the top AI labs read us. Anyone who's basically interested in or working in AI at the frontier and wants to know what's on reads us.

(00:27:00):
We do a lot of... For example, whenever OpenAI or Anthropic drop a new model, we get our hands on it early, and then we get to play with it and write about it, which it's my ideal job. I love it. It's the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:14):
It sounds like it.

Dan Shipper (00:27:14):
I don't if I can curse on this podcast, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):
You can.

Dan Shipper (00:27:15):
... it's the fucking best.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:18):
Perfect. Excellent use. And you call those "vibe checks", is that the-

Dan Shipper (00:27:22):
Yeah, we call them vibe checks-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):
Vibe checks, love those.

Dan Shipper (00:27:24):
... which I think is really important because... And this gets to the next part, the apps part of what we do. I think it's really important to do vibe checks and to call them vibe checks because they're about how does it feel to use this thing and how does it feel to use it for work for things that you would normally use it for in your job or in your life. Because I think that captures something that standard benchmarks just don't capture and really can't. And the best people to tell... to write a vibe check are people that are actually at the edge using it for stuff.

(00:27:57):
And so what we've found over time is we have... We love, we think the best writing and content about technology is from people that are actually using it and building with it. And so we've always had this sort of function, where we're always building little experiments in addition to our writing, and that helps us write great stuff. And that has turned into a suite of apps that we run internally. And the people who are building those apps are also writers, and they're contributing to things like vibe checks.

(00:28:27):
So you get a really inside look into how is this stuff being built from people who are actually using it every day. And the suite of apps that we have, one's called Cora. We just launched Cora publicly on the day that we're recording this, which is really awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:39):
Congratulations.

Dan Shipper (00:28:40):
Thank you. You can think of it like a chief of staff, an AI chief of staff for your email. It helps you manage your email with AI. It's very cool. We can go into more of it later. We have another one called Sparkle, which is an AI file cleaner. We have another one called Spiral that does content automation with AI. We originally incubated Lex, which is an AI document writer, which we spun out into its own company, and my Every co-founder runs that.

(00:29:05):
And basically we bundle everything together. So you pay one price, and you get access to all of the software that we make, and we're constantly putting new stuff in the bundle. And I can tell you more about what kinds of things do we like to incubate and how do we like to incubate it because I think there's some really interesting, special things in there.

(00:29:21):
But I've been blabbering for a while, so I'll stop there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):
There's also a consulting firm, which I want to talk about, but let's hold off on that.

Dan Shipper (00:29:25):
Yeah, we have consulting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (00:29:27):
We also do that, and that's the third leg of the stool in the business. It doesn't fit quite as nicely into my ideas in app streaming, but we spend a lot of time with big companies, where we teach them basically how to be AI-first. We train all the people on how to use AI. And it's very cool, it's really fun, and a very important part of what we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:47):
That feels like a billion-dollar business right there. I want to come back to it.

Dan Shipper (00:29:50):
[inaudible 00:29:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:51):
Because everybody wants to learn this.

(00:29:53):
Okay, so share a few ways that you guys operate. You mentioned that your team doesn't write any code. What are just some ways that allow you to operate this efficiently? I know your team's really small. You have a daily newsletter, you have three, four products, you have a consulting arm. How big is the team at Every?

Dan Shipper (00:30:10):
We have 15 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:11):
15 people? Okay.

Dan Shipper (00:30:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:12):
So just give us insight into some of the ways you operate that are at the bleeding edge.

Dan Shipper (00:30:16):
Okay, so a couple of things. One, and I think everyone should do this, is we have a head of AI operations. I sit with her once a week. And every time I'm doing something repetitively, we put it in a to-do list. And she's just constantly building prompts, and building workflows, and stuff like that so that I and everyone else on the team are just automating as much as possible. And I think that has been a big unlock because it's really hard to...

(00:30:44):
If you're working in a job all day, you're fighting fires, and you're like, "Okay, am I going to do this in the way that I know how or am I going to do it in the new way that might not work?" I don't want to spend a bunch of time [inaudible 00:30:54] you're building some no-code automation. I don't want to do that. And having an AI operations lead lets you basically identify those things and have them solved without people who are doing the work actually having to take time to do it, which I think makes it much more likely it happens.

(00:31:10):
There's always a trick with that, where it's like you have to make sure it gets used. So it's basically you're developing little applications internally, but if you're good at making applications people use, it's great. Highly recommend having an AI operations lead.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:23):
I imagine you saw the [inaudible 00:31:25] Quora tweeted about this, wanting to hire exactly this sort of person.

Dan Shipper (00:31:29):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:29):
So clearly this is a trend.

Dan Shipper (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:31):
So the idea is your point that this needs to be somebody who's outside of the day-to-day work of the company, and is specifically focused on helping the team be more efficient with AI?

Dan Shipper (00:31:43):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):
And then is this person mostly just you automating you, or can they help other people? Are they helpful-

Dan Shipper (00:31:49):
No, she helps everyone, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):
Everyone? Okay.

Dan Shipper (00:31:51):
Where we're starting right now is with the editorial operation. So there's so much stuff in the editorial operation, where I or our editor in chief, Kate... Kate, is constantly doing little, small copy edits to make sure everything is in Every style, and it takes hours a day. And so now Opus is at a point where you can give it a style guide and a prompt, and it will go through anything you're writing, and copy edit it, which is amazing.

(00:32:24):
The trick is it's not just building that. You also have to get Kate to be like, "Did you put this through the prompt yet," anytime someone gives her something. So there's a little bit of behavioral update too that has to happen, which I think is a really interesting organizational challenge.

(00:32:38):
And I think for us it's a little easier because everybody inside the org is very AI-first and just wants to go do it. We don't have anyone really who's like, "I don't know. I don't really want to do this." And that's a whole different challenge, which I think a lot of organizations face, but there's always a problem of getting people to use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:55):
That is super cool. What is her background, this AI operations person?

Dan Shipper (00:32:59):
Her name is Katie Parrott. She actually does a lot of ghostwriting for us. So she also, when people inside of Every who are builders... Often they just write themselves, but sometimes they want help, and she'll help them write about whatever they're working on. So that's how she started with us. She still does that, but she also spends a lot of time doing the AI operation stuff.

(00:33:20):
And then before that, she worked at Animalz, which is a content marketing agency, one of the top content marketing agencies. And they're very process oriented. And I think the reason Katie is so good is because she's incredibly good at that kind of process stuff or thinking about that, but she's also a great writer and she's also just incredibly excited about AI. She just wants to tinker and wants to use it. And that was the thing that got me to be like, "Okay, you should just come and do that. Instead of just ghostwriting, we should add this to your plate." And it's been really fantastic.

(00:33:58):
At minimum, you really just want someone who's just like, "I want to tinker. I want to build stuff." There's also people who have a little bit more of that process orientation. I think that is important. And to the extent they understand the craft of the thing that they're trying to build for, that also helps a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:14):
This is an amazing tip. I feel like everyone's going to start hiring these people.

Dan Shipper (00:34:17):
I think so. There's a couple other people who talk about this. I heard Rachel Woods, who's another... She thinks a lot of AI stuff. She's talking about it. I think it's becoming a thing, and I think it's really important, and it just bleeds out into every other part of the org.

(00:34:33):
So we're doing this inside of the editorial org, but there's a lot of copy that goes out on Cora. And by the way, Cora is spelled C-O-R-A, so it's different from Q-U-O-R-A, slightly confusing. There's a lot of copy that goes out on Cora, or Spiral, or Sparkle that we want to have that same Every quality bar for. And so we have engineers sending Kate, like, "Here's the Figma file. Can you go and do copy edits?" And that sucks for everybody. And Kate is one person, and it's just really hard to do that.

(00:35:04):
So one thing that we did, Nityesh, who's one of the engineers on Cora, built a Claude Code command that just uses that prompt, and checks through the entire code base for all the copy edits, and then creates a pull request on GitHub, and then sends the pull request to Kate. So she's just looking at the pull request, and being like, "Does this make sense?"

(00:35:26):
And so you can translate that prompt into, for example, a format that engineers can use. And suddenly your engineering team is writing marketing copy in the style you want. I think that's so cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:36):
That is extremely cool. I'm going to take us on a little tangent. You keep mentioning-

Dan Shipper (00:35:42):
[inaudible 00:35:42].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):
... Claude, and I'm curious just what is in the stack of tools that you find yourself using, your team ends up using. It seems like Claude is a core part of it.

Dan Shipper (00:35:51):
I do love Claude. I would say I'm generally... My first thing that I open is o3. I'm a ChatGPT boy. And I think o3 is super high quality. I think it's great for writing, it's great for coding, it's great for all that stuff. And what it has that really makes a difference still from Claude is it has memory. And I just love that. I've spent so much time yelling at ChatGPT about, "I need my writing to be punchy and concise." And it just knows that now.

(00:36:20):
So I think when I ask it to write something for me, it's actually better than yours. Or maybe not yours, but your average ChatGPT user. And I also find I use it a lot for self-reflection and personal growth type stuff. So it knows me. So when I send it a meeting transcript, and I'm like, "How did I do?" It's like, "Well, you did that thing that you normally do, but you're way better on this other thing." And I like that. I think that's really great. So day-to-day, o3, that's my go-to.

(00:36:49):
I think Claude Opus is... First of all, Claude Code, everyone inside Every, that's basically what we use. If you're building something, you're using Claude Code. It's crazy. It's so good.

(00:37:01):
Gemini just came out with something, so I'm very excited to try that because I think that's the model that we use most for the apps that we build, inside the apps. It's incredibly powerful and it's incredibly cheap, which is great. So I want to try the CLI tool that they came out with.

(00:37:17):
We also use Codex a bit, which is OpenAI's coding tool. And that's for, like, "I want a one-off, self-contained... I want to pick off this little feature."

(00:37:27):
What else do I use? Going back to Claude, Claude Opus 4 can do something that no other model, except one other model that I can't talk about... can do something that no-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
[inaudible 00:37:39].

Dan Shipper (00:37:39):
... other model can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):
Okay, we won't go there. We don't want to get you in trouble. Okay, go on.

Dan Shipper (00:37:44):
But yeah, no other model can do this. Which is earlier versions of Claude, and I think generally versions of other models, when you ask them, "Is this piece of writing any good," Claude, for example, would always give it a B+. And then if you did another turn of the same conversation, you're like, "I updated this," it would always go to A-. And then if you give it another turn, it would go to A.

(00:38:07):
So it doesn't have the same kind of gut. It's thinking about what you probably want hear too much. And there's various methods that you can use to prompt engineer around this, like give it a template or whatever. And they sort of worked, but it just still doesn't have that thing where it's like, "Can it tell if writing is interesting or any good? Does it have that gut sense?" And Opus 4 has it. It's really wild. And I think that's super important because it opens up all these use cases where you might want to use a language model as a judge. So for us, for example, we're working on a new version of our product Spiral, which does content automation. You've used that in the past. And we're doing essentially Claude Code, but for content style product, where you say, "I want it to write a tweet," you give it all the documents, it has a bunch of memories, it creates a to-do list for itself, and then it goes and writes.

(00:39:04):
And one of the things that is so interesting is now, because it can judge things, part of its to-do list is, "Okay, I wrote three tweets. I'm going to judge whether I think these are any good," and then it can improve before it comes back to you.

(00:39:21):
And that's just a huge, huge unlock, that we were struggling for three months to build this crazy system to try to get it to judge writing. And then Opus 4, just one-shotted it, and we're like, "Great, this product works. Let's start chipping it." So yeah, I love it for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):
Are there any other AI tools that you just use regularly? You mentioned Granola, even outside of the bottles. So what are some that you think maybe people are sleeping on?

Dan Shipper (00:39:46):
I use Granola. So I used to use Super Whisper and Whisper flow, which I think are fantastic. We have an internal version of that called Monologue that will be shipping in a month or so that I use now, but you can think of them as roughly equivalent. And I think generally speech to text interfaces are the future, and more people should be using them, and more people should be building them as affordances. We use Notion all the time, and I specifically use their meeting recording. I think that's mostly the stack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:17):
Okay. That was really helpful and super interesting.

(00:41:28):
Let's go back to ways that your team operates. You mentioned having Kate. Was that her name?

Dan Shipper (00:41:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:33):
Okay. What else? What else do you do that you think other companies should be doing or will eventually start doing?

Dan Shipper (00:41:39):
So the Cora team, which is Kieran and Nityesh, basically-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:43):
[inaudible 00:41:43] that's the team, two people?

Dan Shipper (00:41:44):
That's the team, yeah. Well, with Cora, it's Kieran, Nityesh, and 15 Claude Code instances, so it's more powerful than you think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):
I love that. This is just, again, a glimpse into the future.

Dan Shipper (00:41:58):
One of the things that we do that I think is really cool, and they basically invented this, I had nothing to do with this, is they invented the idea of compounding engineering. So basically, for every unit of work, you should make the next unit of work easier to do.

(00:42:16):
So an example is, in a Claude Code world, where you're not coding a lot, you end up spending a lot of time essentially typing PRDs. Like, "Here's a document with exactly the stuff that I need to do," right? And so you could just be like, "Okay, cool. That's my job now. I'm going to just write PRDs." And so each successive PRD, it's the same amount of work.

(00:42:45):
Or you could spend a little bit of time being like... There's a sort of platonic ideal of a PRD. And what I'm going to do is write a prompt that can take my rambling thoughts and then turn that into a PRD. And so you spend a little bit of work to make all of the next PRDs that you're doing easier to write because you're writing less of them.

(00:43:08):
And so finding those little speed-ups, where every time you're building something, you're making it easier to do that same thing next time, I think gets you a lot more leverage in your engineering team.

(00:43:20):
And so, yeah, we have Kieran and Nityesh. And Cora, it just became public. It was in private beta. It had 2,500 active users. And there's millions of emails going through it. And that's one of the products that we do as a 15-person company. It's kind of crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:37):
It is crazy. How do you do the speed-up thing? Is it prompts that they continue to refine [inaudible 00:43:44]?

Dan Shipper (00:43:44):
A lot of it is prompts, and automations, and stuff like that. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:47):
Got it. For automations, what's the tool? What's the tool you use for automating automations?

Dan Shipper (00:43:52):
What they're using a lot of is Claude Code. So you can do slash commands in Claude Code, which are repeated prompts that you're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):
Got it. Okay. So basically they're building a library of prompts that make the process, of, "Here's what I want to build," to a good solid PRD that you can feed into Claude Code more correct and more efficient?

Dan Shipper (00:44:13):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:14):
Super interesting. And they just keep a file or they put this into a project? Is that how they store this stuff?

Dan Shipper (00:44:14):
It's a GitHub. It's a GitHub GitHub-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):
[inaudible 00:44:22].

Dan Shipper (00:44:22):
... where they can share it with each other.

(00:44:24):
Another thing that they do, which I think is very cool, is they use a bunch of Claudes at once, but then they're also using three other agents. There's an agent called Friday that they love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:36):
That's an AI Asian product called Friday?

Dan Shipper (00:44:38):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:38):
Hadn't heard of that. Okay, interesting.

Dan Shipper (00:44:40):
There's another one called Charlie that they really love. And in particular, I think the thing they like about Charlie... We have a whole video about this, which I can send to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:47):
Yeah, I'll point to it.

Dan Shipper (00:44:48):
They did an S-tier through F-tier of AI agents, which I think is so funny. And one of the things I really like about Charlie is that it lives in GitHub, so when you get a pull request, you can just be like, at Charlie, "Can you check this out?" And that seems to work really well to have different agents that have maybe slightly different perspectives. It's like different people that have different perspectives and have different taste.

(00:45:15):
Kieran, he's one of those serious Rails-files, who they just love Rails, and they love the way that Rails feels, and so I think he has a real sensitivity to... Okay, this agent, ChatGPT for example, it feels very terse, and minimal, and professional, and it has a particular kind of style that maybe he likes. Versus, I don't know, Claude is a slightly different style. And I think all of that is so interesting that these things have personalities, and that that changes what you might want to use it for or why you might want to use three of them at once.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):
That is so fascinating. It makes me think about Peter Deng's conversation again, where he talks about his hiring strategy and one of his key lessons. And he ended up hiring the current head of product for ChatGPT, the current head of marketing at ChatGPT, the current head of engineering because he hires these incredible people.

(00:46:07):
And his philosophy is to hire a team of Avengers, where everyone is strong at certain things, and together they're the perfect team, versus everyone... versus the best at everything. And it's interesting that you can almost do that with different product, different agents from different companies.

Dan Shipper (00:46:22):
You definitely can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):
And it makes me feel like there's a bigger market than people think potentially, where people will want different companies, agents, not just all Devins or not all Codexes.

Dan Shipper (00:46:30):
I think there really is. It's definitely not one agent to rule them all at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):
So interesting.

Dan Shipper (00:46:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:36):
Oh, my God. The two people on the Cora team, what's their background? Are they both engineers or what are they?

Dan Shipper (00:46:42):
They're both engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):
Okay.

Dan Shipper (00:46:44):
Kieran's got this crazy background, where... They both have really interesting backgrounds. Kieran's got this crazy background, where he was previously VP Eng at a startup, so was effectively the CTO of a startup, or maybe two startups, and was one of the founders. But before that, he was a composer, a professional composer. And before that, he was a baker. So we did a team retreat in France last year, and he taught us all how to make croissants. My croissant was horrible. His was beautiful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:14):
Seems [inaudible 00:47:16].

Dan Shipper (00:47:16):
And generally, I think that kind of multidimensional type of talent is the kind of person that I love having at Every. Because we're all generalists. We all want to use AI for all these weird, awesome, creative things. And someone who has that background is going to have a good taste for not only agents, but, "What should the landing page look like," or whatever. Which I think is increasingly important, where you're trying to scale a team of generalists of 15 people to five products. So that's Kieran's background.

(00:47:43):
Natasha's background is... I'm jealous because he only started learning to code when ChatGPT came out. He had wanted to learn to code forever, and he's only known how to code in an AI era. And I keep telling him, "Dude, I learned to program in middle school from books." I had to go to Barnes & Noble and buy a book. And there was nothing... I couldn't Google any-

Dan Shipper (00:48:00):
I had to go to Barnes and Noble and buy a book and there was nothing... I couldn't Google anything about why this function wasn't working.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:08):
No Stack Overflow even back then.

Dan Shipper (00:48:10):
Yeah, yeah. There wasn't that overflow. There was weird BB net forums and stuff that I was like 12 and I probably shouldn't have been on there or whatever. So he has gone so much faster than any other engineer, I think in a pre AI era. And I see the same thing in the rest of the company. I think there's this huge question about what happens when kids... Entry level jobs are taken away by AI. And my take is like that's worth thinking about and it's possible that that might be a problem at some point. But my take is whenever I see a kid with ChatGPT, I'm like, holy shit, they're going to grow so much faster than any other person that I've worked with. We have this guy Alex Duffy who works with us, he writes for Context Window and he just launched, we taught AIs how to play diplomacy with each other, which is really cool.

(00:49:08):
And he did that whole thing and I think he's really, really, really talented. And when he came to us, I guess almost a year ago now, it was one of those classic cases which I've seen over and over at every... Which is, you have great ideas, but you're not a good writer yet and it's really hard for me to do anything with you until you're good enough at it. So I have to give you small little things until you get better and blah, blah, blah, whatever. And what I noticed with him is he was just making a year. He made a year's worth of progress in two months because every time I sat down with him and told him, okay, here's how you tell a story. Here's how you think about a headline. He recorded all of it, put it into a prompt, and he never made the same mistake twice.

(00:49:49):
And I think he's so much accelerated from where he would have been because of this stuff, and I see that in lots of other parts of the work. So Natasha is another good example. And so I think generally people are going to figure out that some 20-year-old with ChatGPT subscription is super powerful if you just mentor them. And I think that's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:11):
Man, there's so many threads I could follow here. There's all this fear of entry level people will never... The roles are disappearing for entry level people and so how will we ever have senior people if these people can't learn to do things as an entry level person? And what you're saying is ChatGPT and these tools help you accelerate really quickly so you don't really need to be at the bottom rung for a long time.

Dan Shipper (00:50:33):
Yeah. You're effectively learning how to be one level above the entry level from the beginning and this is sort of my whole allocation economy thesis where when you look at skills are going to be valuable in the AI era, one big group of skills are the skills of managers. Today, they're human managers, tomorrow everyone's a model manager. Right now, AI is not... Right now, management skills are not broadly distributed, because it's very expensive, another expensive thing that... So 8% of the workforce is managers. It's now going to be much cheaper to manage, so more people are going to have to do it. And so that's the thing that kids, 20-year-olds, whatever, I see is now are going to start to have to learn in addition to, it's not like you can just say, okay, go do it and then come back. You have to be able to go into the work that's being done and help make it better. But they're learning both at the same time. They're learning how to manage and how to do the actual work so that they're good at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):
And the managing here is managing agents. Right?

Dan Shipper (00:51:41):
Yeah. You're managing AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:43):
And so coming back to your point about how this core team, and I guess you said everyone doesn't write code, zero code written, now it's just managing agents that are writing code for you.

Dan Shipper (00:51:54):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):
Okay. I've never heard of a company at this stage, so this is extremely cool. So the workflow is they give it, here's what I want. I refine it using this cool prompts library that they build on and agents build code, write the code. Then basically the time is spent reviewing code and then reviewing the output. What does it look like? What does it feel like? And then continuing to refine, wow. So you guys are at where Michael from Cursor said we will be. So I chatted with him a few months ago. He said in a year, this is where he thinks the thing will be. We're not looking at code anymore. You guys are already there. Although you were looking at code. Okay, you're still looking at code.

Dan Shipper (00:52:33):
They definitely are looking at code. So you're doing a code review before you do anything. And I do think Danny, who runs Spiral, which is the cloud code for content tool I was talking about that we're building, he spent a couple of days digging into the internals of some third party library that we were interested in just because it's helpful to know, it's helpful to understand those things, but then he's not actually writing any code. Once he understands it, he's just off telling cloud code what to do. And I think that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:08):
This is an insane milestone we're hitting here. There's this sense we're getting to a place where you don't need to really understand code, you don't have to write any code. We'll get there and you guys are there. I think this is so easy to overlook how wild this is. You have a product team not writing code at all.

Dan Shipper (00:53:26):
It is really wild. I think it's really wild in particular, just having a small group of people that have... Everyone has all these different skills. Everyone's a generalist, everyone's AI forward. So what you can do in an environment like that with just still a small team is crazy. And you're kind of inventing all these new principles for how do we work together, how do we do engineering, all that kind of stuff. And I think that's what makes the writing... That's why I like doing that is because the writing that we do from that I think is really good because we can talk about it from a sort of position of experience, but I do want to say something else which is we're not at a point yet where the people that work at every could do what they do if they didn't know how to code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
Yeah, this is what I was going to ask.

Dan Shipper (00:54:10):
Which is a different bar, and I think for a long time it's going to be valuable to know how to code for a long time, but this is a progression that is not a new progression. So for example, when I was in middle school learning to code, the new hot thing was scripting languages, which is Python and JavaScript. But if you were a real programmer, you would understand the language underlying Python and JavaScript, which is written in C. and scripting language weren't totally real. And in order to really do anything interesting, you had to be able to learn both parts of the stack. Same thing for C programmers, when I guess in the seventies C was invented, it was like you got to be able to write assembly.

(00:54:59):
And English is just a layer on top of scripting languages. So I think all of those things were right in the sense that there's... Especially during transitions, there's a lot of reasons why it's important to be able to go down a layer in the stack and it gets less and less frequent over time, but that still takes a long time. And there's some times when even if you're a JavaScript or a Python programmer, it's useful to know how that stuff works, how it's written, and see how it's implemented. Today it's much less important than it used to be, but that took 10 or 20 years. And I think that the same thing is going to be true for programming. Having that skill is super important and will accelerate you significantly. It will sort of start to get less important over time, but we're not close to that yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):
Okay. That's a really important point. I'm glad you went there. So do you have a sense of how far we might be from you hiring someone to build another product that isn't an engineer?

Dan Shipper (00:55:54):
Like a real SaaS product?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):
So hey, we have this idea we want to bring someone on to actually lead it.

Dan Shipper (00:56:00):
Very far. Not within sight, but there's a lot of things that could be products that are a level down from that I think that you could do almost now. So an example, we were talking about DIA, the new AI browser from the browser company. DIA has these things called skills, which are effectively little AI apps that you can run in the browser. You can prompt them and they run on the web page and do work for you. A non-technical person can build that, same thing for custom GPTs from ChatGPT. A non-technical person can definitely build that. So I think while I will definitely maintain that we're not anywhere close to anybody being able to build a conventional SaaS app with zero programming knowledge, aside from just a demo, there are going to be other forms of software.

(00:56:55):
One of my things is like software is becoming content. There's going to be other forms of software that don't look like the software today, but you can run, start and run as a business, as a non-technical person even if you don't know how to code. And that'll happen very soon. I mean, it's already kind of happening. It doesn't look like the thing that you're asking about. It's sort of like the difference between a Hollywood movie and a YouTube video.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):
I think that's really reassuring to a lot of people. Basically what you're seeing is AI just supercharges people who have a skill and allows them to do a lot more.

Dan Shipper (00:57:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:26):
Okay. Is there any other way that you guys operate that is really interesting that might be worth sharing that helps you operate really quickly, helps you do more with less?

Dan Shipper (00:57:38):
I mean, I would love to talk about how we think about building products, what products to build, what do we end up building? Because I think that there's something sort of special about it that probably there's a playbook that is useful for people. So when I think about... This is only sort of snapped into focus recently. So a lot of this was just doing it intuitively without really a thought for it. But when I think about the kind of things that we have ended up incubating, it's basically goes back to something I said at the beginning, which is there are these things that were historically really expensive that only rich people or big companies could buy. So a chief of staff for your email, I think a therapist or a lawyer is another interesting example. Someone to organize your closet or organize your computer is another example. Someone to go straight for you, that are becoming orders of magnitude cheaper so that everyone can use them even if you're at a small startup.

(00:58:39):
And so basically when you're running, we are sort of this AI first company. You're running into all these little things where you're like, I wish I had a ghost writer right now, but ghost writers are really expensive. Or I wish I had a lawyer but it would cost me like $25,000. Lawyers are really expensive and there's a lot more demand for those services than can be fulfilled because they're so expensive. And what AI does is it allows you to be like, oh, I could just use cloud for that. I can use ChatGPT for that. And so you're able to use the demand that you have that we can afford a lawyer. We have ghost writers, but there's a lot more that we can't do because we can't afford it. So we still have our lawyer and we still have our ghost writers, but we just do a lot more of that stuff.

(00:59:27):
And so we notice that. We start to then use ChatGPT and cloud first, these general purpose tools to try it and see is this useful? Does this actually work? All that kind of stuff. And then if it does, we will unbundle it into its own separate thing that becomes an app. And I think what's really special about this time is the entire game board has been totally reset in terms of things you can build. Where five years ago it was like you're going to build another Notes app. We've been building notes app for forever, another B2B SAS app. It's all the same stuff in slightly different packaging. And now it's totally new territory. No one knows what's going on. Everyone's inventing it as it happens. All these new workflows are being created in a very similar way to, I don't know, for example, when spreadsheets were first a thing on computers, we were figuring out all these new workflows on spreadsheets.

(01:00:24):
They got unbundled in the B2B SAS, same thing for ChatGPT and Claude. And what's really cool is you can be like, cool, I'm using using ChatGPT for this. It's really useful for me. And you might be one of the first people to really notice that. And then because everybody that works at Every is AI first and came to us because they reads Every, they read Every, so we all have the same vibe and we're all kind of doing similar stuff. They become our first users. So we measure the success of the product by is it a banger inside of Every, monologue the app that I was talking to you about, everyone just started using it and we're like, okay, we've got something here.

(01:01:05):
And what's really interesting then is if everyone inside of Every uses it and people read Every, they have a similar vibe to us too, so they become the next set of users. And that's a really, I think, interesting pipeline for building applications or building apps. It's a totally new greenfield so that all the stuff you're thinking about, it's probably new, which is really cool. And over time, what I think is organizations like ours, people who are playing at the edge, we're doing things that in three years everybody else is going to be doing. So it may be kind of niche for now, but it will be a big deal in three years when everyone else has the same needs that we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:45):
That is really cool. What I'm hearing is GPT wrappers are a good idea and are worth building.

Dan Shipper (01:01:50):
100% thank you. GPT wrappers are amazing and they've been much maligned for absolutely no reason and people don't understand how absolutely valuable they are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):
I think there's also just you guys raised a sip seed round. This is a good time to maybe talk about that. Just these products don't have to become some mega-billion dollar hits. You kind of have this portfolio of companies, you have the content business. So I think there's a really interesting approach to how big these need to get to be successful. Maybe just talk about that.

Dan Shipper (01:02:25):
Yeah. I really want Every to be an institution that teaches people how to live a better, more human life with technology, particularly with AI. And both teaches them how to do it with writing and the content we make and then builds tools for them to do that. But I think fundamental to building an institution is, at least for me, the way I would like to do it is I want internally it to feel like this creative playground where we have the opportunity to take risk and do stuff and do weird stuff that just doesn't make any sense. We can't justify anyone, but we just feel like it would be fun. And so I think I'm always playing with that dynamic tension between institution serious, we want this to be lasting and important and it should just be fun. Let's play around. And I think having that tension is really valuable.

(01:03:16):
And so I've always been sort of hesitant to raise a lot of money because I think it locks you into having to be that serious thing that's totally going for it. And there's lots of companies that figure out that balance. But just for me personally as a founder, I'm like, I want to keep the optionality alive and I want to keep the kind of playful feeling alive. And I think part of that comes from I know I have the control to do what I want more or less. There's probably also some deeper psychological things going on there, which I'm happy to talk about if you want to get into it. But I think there's also just... That's what I want. And so when we started Every, we raised a very small 700K pre-seed round, and this was at the height of the creator economy.

(01:03:59):
So we both started our newsletters. He and I started our newsletters around the same time. It was the hypest, craziest thing. People were throwing money around. It was wild. But we raised 700K because it was like, I want to raise enough for us to be able to experiment, have a little cash cushion, but not so much that it locks us into anything. And we sent an email to all of our investors being like, and you're one of our investors, so you've probably got this email.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):
Tiny investor. But I'm in there, I'm in there.

Dan Shipper (01:04:26):
We sent an email to everyone being like, this is probably not a venture business, so you should not expect us to raise again. And we even raised on this slightly modified safe that gave everyone the option to convert to equity in three years, even if we didn't raise more money. So we did it in a way that allowed us the option to get really big and do the traditional thing and also the option to do it the way we want to do it. Maybe it's not a huge business, but we love it. That's great. And we did the same thing for this recent round where we raised up to 2 million from Reid Hoffman and starting line VC. And we did it as what I've been calling a sip seed round, which is basically they've committed $2 million, but we can pull it down whenever we want and we just do it on a safe at a set cap.

(01:05:12):
And for me, that's really helpful because it allows me psychologically to take a lot more risk. If we go to zero on the bank account, I can get more money. Great. I don't have to think about it. But what's also really helpful is I'm not, and the rest of the team is not staring at a gigantic number in the bank account being like, cool, we can burn this. Let's burn it. And also for our investors, I think Reid very much wants us to succeed, but I don't think he cares what size of business this is. I think he's more philosophically aligned with the thing that we're trying to do. And if it becomes a huge business, he's psyched for it. And I think that kind of alignment is what I was looking for. I think there's this core creative spirit to the thing that I want to maintain and I really care about having a big impact.

(01:06:03):
But I think there's a lot of ways to have an impact. And one of them is building a $10 billion business. I think another way is really changing how people see the world, see themselves in the world. And I think that's what stories do. And you don't necessarily... Sometimes you do that by building a gigantic company, but you don't necessarily always have to do that. A lot of the stories that we care about most are from people who maybe they weren't rich at all. And so I really like creating this place where we can make a really good business. And I care a lot about that. But also the core of the soul of it is about changing how people see themselves in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
I love that you've kind of innovated a new middle ground way of fundraising, not bootstrap and not just regular VC. It's a seed. And I love that this two... If I raised 50 million, it'd be like, okay, I get it. Let's not put 50 million in our bank account, but you do have 2 million. It's too much for us. We don't want to see that in our account.

Dan Shipper (01:07:01):
That's another thing. And we'll see how this ages. I might be back here in two years crying the blues because we didn't raise enough money or whatever. Who knows? But that's the other thing is I do think we can get so much further with very small amounts of money. Like Cora, I think all in to build Cora, we've spent maybe 300K, Maybe. That's crazy because-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
And that includes salaries?

Dan Shipper (01:07:27):
Includes salaries. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:27):
Wow.

Dan Shipper (01:07:28):
This product was not even technically possible even if you had billions of dollars three years ago. Not possible because you can't do email summarizing and automatic responses and all that kind of stuff without GPT. So not only was it totally impossible, but now we can get with two engineers, we can get the amount done that would've taken a team of 20 people. And I think that means that we need less money. And I don't think that VC has really caught up to that yet. And I think there are other companies that are doing... There's a term called seed strapping, so there are other companies that are starting to wake up to this too. And I'm curious about how it changes the VC model. For sure for us, we have a specific incubation model, which is a bit different from a VC model. And I think there's some differentiation in the stuff that we can do with founders, which is kind of cool. But yeah, I'm just trying to figure out a shape that works for me and that's different from other people and we'll see how this goes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):
We'll revisit in a couple years. Seems like it's going great from the outside. I'm going to ask about a couple other things before we wrap up. One is around this consulting arm that you have. I think it's really interesting because like I said, I feel like this could be a billion-dollar business. I feel like every company right now is trying to figure out what the hell's everyone else figured out that we're not doing. I've had so many emails from chief product officers at companies being like, can you introduce me to some chief product officers that have done cool things with AI that we should learn from? So many people and I would just introduce them to each other and it's cool because you guys are basically solving that problem for a lot of companies.

(01:09:18):
So one is just maybe share a bit about what that side of the business for folks. And then two, I feel like I imagine you've seen companies that have done this really well, have adopted AI, things have worked really well, they found really good productivity gains, and then you found companies that don't. What do you find is the difference between those two?

Dan Shipper (01:09:35):
I love this question and I have a very specific opinion about this. So one, yeah, the consulting arm, basically we spend all of our time playing around with new models, writing about them and building stuff with them. And we have a big audience. So naturally we've gotten companies over time being like, can you just come and teach us how to do this? And so we started to do that. This is pretty nascent. It's probably been over the last six to nine months, but it's a pretty big business now. It'll probably double this year. Last year we did about a million. Maybe it'll be more this year. We'll see. It depends on a couple... We have a couple of big contracts out, so it might be way more than that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:13):
A billion. I predict a billion dollars in a few years.

Dan Shipper (01:10:17):
But yeah, basically people are like, can you come help us learn how to do this? So what we do is we spend some time going and researching your organization. So we go in and try to understand what are all the different teams doing, what are the repetitive tasks, some of the stuff we were talking about earlier. And then what we will do is first we present a little report, tells you here's everything that we found. Here's not only that, but you have a chatbot where you can chat with all the interviews that we did and you can pull out your own insights. We have a whole dashboard where it shows you, here are the teams that are really into this, here are the teams that are not. Here's how much leverage you might be able to get on different teams based on the interviews and based on the AI analysis.

(01:10:57):
It's pretty cool. And that's an app that I coded over a weekend with Devin a year ago. And then Alex runs part of the consulting has helped upgrade it. Then what we do is we have a training curriculum. So we go in and train each team and we customize it based on the interviews that we do. Because one of the interesting things about AI is it's such a general purpose technology, and I think people who work inside companies, 10% of them are like, I'm super curious about this. 10% are like, I will never touch this. And 80% are like, if you tell me how to do it for my job, I'll do it.

(01:11:31):
And so we customize the training to be like, here are the exact prompts you're going to use and here's the exact situations you're going to use them. And that really, I think helps drive the adoption. We spend four weeks with each team, an hour a week, that kind of thing. It seems to be really cool. And then we'll often also after this, go and build automations and do some of the AI operations stuff we were talking about earlier. Companies really like it. I think we work with a lot of big hedge funds and PE firms and big companies, all that kind of stuff. To your-

Dan Shipper (01:12:00):
Companies, all that kind of stuff. To your second question, which is, "What separates the good companies from the bad, or the companies that end up adopting this?," I think the number one predictor is, "Does the CEO use ChatGPT?," or insert your own chatbot. If the CEO is in it all the time, being like, "This is the coolest thing," everybody else is going to start doing it. If the CEO is like, "I don't know, this is for someone else," no one else is going to be able to lead that charge, and they're either going to have ... Either they're going to be negative on it, and so definitely no one's going to do it, or they're going to have way unrealistic expectations because they have no intuition for what's possible, and they're just going to get really disappointed.

(01:12:47):
But the CEOs that are using it all the time are able to both drive the excitement and set reasonable expectations for what can be achieved, and so those things end up working really well, and the people that do this really well ... So, for example, we work with a hedge fund called Walleye, which I had the founder on my podcast, AI and I, a few weeks ago, their gigantic $10 billion hedge fund. One of the things that they do, which I think they're basically the model for how to do this, first thing you did, which a lot of CEOs are doing is send the, "We're an AI-first company" email. Everyone's got the memo.

(01:13:20):
You just got to really do it, and one of the things he said in his memo, which I love, is, "I wrote this email with ChatGPT, and you should too." So you got to like ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
In the memo.

Dan Shipper (01:13:30):
Yeah. You got to lead from the front in that way. And then, what he does in, I think what a lot of other really cool companies do is they're doing weekly meetings where people share prompts and share use cases. They do a weekly email to their entire company, being like, "Okay, here are our usage stats for ChatGPT. Here are the people that came up with a new prompt and contributed to it."

(01:14:00):
Create this sort of awareness and momentum, because going back to the point I made earlier, about 10% of people are early adopters, those are the people inside of a company that you need to find and highlight because they're going to just go spend all this time figuring out what works, and then all you have to do is translate what they learn into the rest of the organization. And so if you create forums for them to be rewarded, you're going to automatically transfer a lot of their learnings to everybody else, and encourage more of it, and I think that's kind of the secret.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):
That is awesome. I love this advice. So just to reflect back, what you just shared, a few kind of tactics you find that you encourage within companies, one is just send this memo, the Toby memo. I don't know if that's the right way to describe it, who I think it was first along these lines just, "We're AI-first." It's going to be part of your performance review.

(01:14:50):
It's going to be asking, "Can you do it in AI before you could talk to anyone else?," all these things, and then just note, "I wrote this using ChatGPT's," it's a great idea. This idea of a weekly meeting, so it's like a live or Zoom meeting, where people share, "Here's the thing I've learned about using AI," and then this weekly stats email of, "Here's how much we're using ChatGPT across the org. Here's some people that did some awesome work."

Dan Shipper (01:15:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:13):
Amazing. And I especially love this very simple heuristic of, "If you're a CEO, uses ChatGPT or Claude, or whatever daily, it's going to work out."

Dan Shipper (01:15:22):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:23):
That is super cool. I know it's early, but what kind of impact have you seen from a company, kind of leaning into this and adopting AI widely? Anything you've seen either anecdotally or numbers-wise?

Dan Shipper (01:15:34):
It's early. It's really hard to say other than ... I think generally, people who do this well now feel like they can do way more work than they used to without having to hire more people, and so they're just going further faster at the same budget. I don't see a lot of people being like, "Cool. We're going to fire a bunch of people."

(01:15:58):
Also, I don't really want to do consulting work like that. That sucks. But we've never had to say no. Mostly, people are like, "Cool. I'm just going to go further with the people that I have."

(01:16:08):
I think also, back to kind of the first point I made about reshoring American jobs, I have seen some companies, not the ones that we worked with, but I have seen some companies of people that I'm friends with, where they're like, "We have a call center somewhere, but I think I can get the same amount done with two employees in the U.S. that use one of these customer service platforms." They're still not totally automatic. I think that Klarna CEO thing, that was bullshit. But, yeah, you can have a couple people in the U.S. that maybe you pay a little bit less to than you would for 100 people somewhere else, and obviously, that's the calculus that everyone has to make for themselves, but I've definitely seen that happen, and yeah, I think that's the get more done with the same amount of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):
Maybe to close out our conversation, I want to come back to this idea that you referenced, but I want to spend a little more time on this, which is this idea of the allocation economy. If I understand it correctly, we've been in this knowledge economy, where people get paid to do a thing, and your thesis is that we're moving to this allocation economy, where the manager skills become more important, and we're going to be spending more of our time managing. And I think what's amazing about this is it also tells you which skills will matter more in the future, which is something I think a lot of people are thinking about. So maybe just answer that question and share whatever you think is important to share to give people a sense of what you're thinking.

Dan Shipper (01:17:38):
Yeah. So this is based on our article I wrote two, two and a half years ago. So this is back before agents were even thought of as viable. And I was really trying to think about, "How do I express what ... In my experience, using this every day, what skills are useful for me?," because I think that'll be the case for a lot of other people, and I think that's kind of the best method, I think, to do these sorts of predictions, is you have to be doing it all the time yourself, and then that informs your opinion about this stuff.

(01:18:14):
So what I noticed using, at the time, like GPT-3 or maybe GPT-4, was that I was spending a lot of time, for example, thinking about, "How do I communicate the problem? How do I gather the right information for the problem? How do I put it in the right way so that the model that I'm working with gets it? How do I pick which model to give it to you, and how do I maybe divide up the task to be like, 'Okay, this model does this, this model does this,' based on what I know to be like, 'What's good and what's bad?'? How do I give them feedback?"

(01:18:50):
"How do I have a vision for what I want and a set of criteria for whether it's good?" All that stuff is exactly how I found myself using these tools, and I was like, "Oh, that's just managing." And once that clicks for you, I think you'll start to see a lot of other things. So a really good example is there's a big complaint that it's like, "Well, how can I have AI do this? I can't trust that they're going to do it well, so I just do it myself."

(01:19:22):
And I'm just like, "Yeah, that's exactly what Every first-time manager says." You always have this problem, where you're like, "Okay. Well, if I delegate it, it's not done in the way that I want it to be done. If I do it myself, I get no leverage." And so that's how a manager has to learn how to be a manager is like, "When do I lean in and maybe micromanage a little bit, and when can I delegate, and how can I trust it, and how do I divide up the task and all that kind of stuff?"

(01:19:45):
And so I think there's a lot of overlap in those skills. And those skills are not broadly distributed right now, but they will be in the future because it will be so much cheaper to be a manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):
And specifically, I was looking at the article you wrote, the skills that you highlight will be more valuable is evaluating talent, vision, taste, and to your point, when to get into the details, when it makes sense to dive in.

Dan Shipper (01:20:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:12):
Awesome. And then, there's also kind of a connected point you made that you referenced, which is that generalists will become more and more valuable in the future. You mentioned that everyone at Every is a generalist.

Dan Shipper (01:20:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):
Share a little bit about that.

Dan Shipper (01:20:22):
Yeah. I find ... I mean, maybe it's because I'm a generalist, so you should take this with a grain of salt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):
Same, same.

Dan Shipper (01:20:28):
But I think that's one of the things that has made AI so awesome for me, is I love to dabble in different things. So it's like in one day, I can be coding an app, and making a video, and making images, and writing, and all that kind of stuff, and ChatGPT is right there with me. And I think basically what has happened, as civilization has progressed from Ancient Greece to now, is what we've discovered is the more that we specialize, the better we can coordinate across many different people. And so it's like the Adam Smith, like there's a pin factory and someone's making a pin or whatever his thing is, is specialization against our trade. And there have been a lot of really good impacts of that.

(01:21:18):
One of my favorite examples of this is back to Ancient Greece, Ancient Athens. Athens was a civilization of generalists, at least for citizens. They have a bad history with women and people who are slaves, but let's just put that to the side for a second. If you're a citizen, generalist. You could be expected to be a fighter, a judge, a juror, maybe a general.

(01:21:46):
You could expect it to have many different roles inside of your society in your lifetime. That changed though, because Athens became an empire. And as it became an empire, if you're going to send a general off to go and invade Sicily or whatever, you want that person to be pretty skilled. And so it started to break the general kind of thing into people start to have specific roles, and they coordinate with each other and all that kind of stuff, and I think that pattern has actually been really good for developing civilization, but it's also, in a lot of ways, it is not as fun. It's actually really cool to be a well-rounded person. And I think the interesting thing about AI is that it's a little bit like, you can think of it like having 10,000 PhDs in your pocket.

(01:22:36):
It knows so much about every little branch of human knowledge and every art form and every way of making things or building things, and you just have access to that, so it's doing a lot of the ... It's good for doing a lot of the specialized tasks that you might've had to spend 10 years getting good at learning about this particular species of cicada, so you know exactly how they reproduce. But now, you've got this thing in your pocket that can tell you all about that in any given context at any given time, and so you're empowered to jump a lot more between all those different domains of skill, and you can get more done as, for example, like a founder, where I think we can stay at 15 people much longer than we would be able to. So the people inside of Every can stay generalists for much longer, and I think that that may sort of ripple out into the rest of the economy, where instead of gigantic, massive corporations, where each person is doing one little button turning, you have many more smaller organizations with more generalists, and I think that would actually be a really good thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:44):
This reminds me, I was talking to my personal trainer that I'm trying out for a little bit, and she said that she's a very big vision, kind of high-level person, and not good at executing, like we're staying organized, and ChatGPT is such a godsend for her, because she's just like, "Here's what I want to do roughly. Just help me get it done."

Dan Shipper (01:24:01):
That's great. I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:03):
And so, yeah. And it really made me think about just how much value all this stuff is going to unlock. This was amazing. It was everything I wanted it to be. But with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Dan, are you ready?

Dan Shipper (01:24:14):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:15):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Dan Shipper (01:24:21):
Well, I already recommended one, which is War and Peace. Definitely got to read that. If you want a like Tolstoy primer, I would read The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Another good one is A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, which is by George Saunders, and that's a collection of Russian short stories that is also about writing. And in particular, I really like the Russians because a lot of the Russian novelists are dealing with the effects of technology on the traditional Russian way of life, and they're very kind of in this really interesting middle ground between a sort of romantic outlook on the world and a more rationalist like, " We're progressing, we're making progress."

(01:25:02):
And that's one of the things you'll find in Anna Karenina, oh, and ... God, what's the guy's ... Levin is out in the fields with the peasants, doing the scythe thing. That's Tolstoy kind of thinking about, "Oh, what would it be like, instead of being a nobleman who's trying to make farms way more efficient, I was just like with my scythe, that was really happy?" Anyway, so they're dealing with a lot of similar stuff to, I think AI.

(01:25:27):
The Master and His Emissary is another really good one, and that's about basically how the different hemispheres of the brain view reality. It's really, really good, and I think it relates to a lot of AI stuff too. Yeah, I think those are my three or four. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:44):
Excellent list. I think nobody's mentioned any of these, so that's always a good sign. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Dan Shipper (01:25:53):
Yes. I really love Deadwood. Have you seen it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):
I absolutely love it. I remember when they stopped it for some reason. I think he had to go do something else at HBO. It was so sad.

Dan Shipper (01:25:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:06):
It's amazing, yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:26:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:26:07):
David Milch is incredible, national treasure, incredible writer. But what I really love about it, and I only recently watched it, is he talks about Deadwood being about how order forms out of chaos. So it's this like frontier town, people are going to it, and there's no law, there's no rules. And by season three, there's a mayor, and all the industry has come in, and it's like a real proper town, and I just love that. And I think there's a lot of parallels from the Western frontier to technology frontiers, and so I think that show is a really interesting study in that kind of dynamic.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:50):
I love how everything connects to how tech works and how AI came to be. I love this.

Dan Shipper (01:26:57):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:58):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Dan Shipper (01:27:00):
I don't have a good answer for that because I just spent a lot of time using our internal products, but my stock answer is Granola. So I do really love Granola. My one gripe with them, and I hope they listen to this podcast, is I really want to export all my notes. I want an API, but other than that, I think it's a fantastic product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:18):
That is definitely the most mentioned product in this segment for the past couple months, so good job, Granola. I can't help but mention, you get a year free of Granola if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter. Well, what a freaking deal. And not just you, but your whole company gets free Granola for a year. What a deal.

Dan Shipper (01:27:34):
This is not a paid promotion by me. That's just how I feel. So I'm glad it's part of the bundle.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:41):
Yeah, incredible. Okay. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?

Dan Shipper (01:27:47):
So basically, I use ChatGPT all the time, and it has memory. So I was like, "I'm going on Lenny's podcast. What would my life motto be?," and it said, "Your life motto is witness deeply, build bravely. You prize slow, attentive seeing, whether it's reading Tolstoy, tracking meditation themes, or X-raying a David Milch paragraph." So it's hitting all the stuff I just mentioned, which is really funny.

(01:28:10):
And then, Build bravely, you turn those insights into concrete things, like Every in Quora and longform essays and all that kind of stuff. So I think there's something about that. Actually, this reminds me, this actually reminds me of the actual motto, which is ... And I didn't come up with this. I think it's like Pliny the Younger said, "Do things worth writing about, and write things worth reading." Seems like a pretty good summation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:31):
Do things worth writing about and read things worth reading.

Dan Shipper (01:28:34):
Write things worth reading.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:36):
Write things worth reading. That should be the motto of both of our newsletters.

Dan Shipper (01:28:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:41):
That is really good. Okay. And by the way, I love that you asked ChatGPT, "What's my life motto?"

Dan Shipper (01:28:48):
And wait, this is interesting. So it didn't give me the answer, but inspired the answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:51):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:28:52):
And I think that's actually exactly how I use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:55):
[inaudible 01:28:55] Wow. It's an extension of our brains already.

Dan Shipper (01:28:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):
Last question. I was reading somewhere, where you wrote that you stopped writing at one point. You were just like, "I need to do other things, I need to build this company," and then you realize, "I need to get back to writing," because things started going sideways. And I feel like this is such an interesting corollary to a lot of the stuff you talked about, of just things that make you happy, stay close to enjoy. Just share what happened there, because I didn't know that.

Dan Shipper (01:29:23):
This is definitely not a lightning round thing, so I'll expound, but I'll try to do it as quickly as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:29):
Perfect.

Dan Shipper (01:29:30):
I think generally, when you're building a company, even if you do it the way that I do it or did it, which is you don't raise a lot of money and you try to stay in control, there's a big temptation to try to run the company in the way you think you should. And I have this weird thing where I'm like, "I really love writing, but I also really love business," and there were not a lot of models for me of people who had successful businesses that were also writers. It turns out there are, but I didn't know about that for a while. And so early on at Every, it was growing really well, because I was writing a lot, and Nathan was writing a lot. And when I stopped writing, the business didn't work as well because media businesses don't follow the same pattern as tech startups, because if you're a media business and you are a founder who then hires people to make the product, which is right, if you have product market fit before, you lose it, and maybe you hire people that are good writers, but that's hard. It's total opposite pattern for startups. So you build the first version of the product, and then you hire people to build the rest of it, and so that's what I did. And I also really struggled with, "Okay, what are the implications for that and for my career," and I think it was hard for me to admit, like I actually want to write because I just didn't have any examples of someone being the kind of writer that I wanted to be. And what's really interesting is three years into the business ... The business has been pretty flat.

(01:30:57):
I was pretty miserable because I was not doing the thing that I really wanted to do, and I asked ChatGPT, I was like, "Are there any examples of writers that have built businesses?" And it was like, "Yeah, Joel Spolsky, who built Trello and Stack Overflow. There's Jason Fried who I've known for a long time, and I've always looked up to, but I forgot about in this context. There is Sam Harris who's got a great podcast, and he's got a gigantic meditation app. There is Bill Simmons, who's incredible podcaster and also built The Ringer, sold to Spotify for a couple hundred million bucks.

(01:31:32):
There's a lot of these people, and there are patterns that they use to build companies that are pretty well-understood. They're just not typical Silicon Valley patterns. And so I was like, "Cool. I just want to be a writer. I think it'll be really fun."

(01:31:48):
And so I sort of flipped. I still have the builder, entrepreneur, founder part of my identity, but I sort of flipped it to be like writing is at the center, and I'm unapologetic about it, and that's actually good for the business. It's good for me and it's good for the business. And the more I've leaned into that, doing the thing that ... If you told anyone that you're starting a business, where it's like, "Well, we're going to be a newsletter, and we're going to incubate all these apps, and we're going to do consulting and whatever," they would be like, "You're nuts."

(01:32:14):
"Everyone wants to do that. Of course, Every founder wants to do that, but you have to focus. You can't write, whatever." But every time I've kind of just leaned into something that feels like the most, the ultimate luxury of my hidden secret desire, it's actually worked a lot better, and I think you end up ... What it really is, is there's a huge tax to doing something every day that you don't quite like that much, or you're not quite a fit for, and by sort of giving into those secret desires, you end up finding a shape for the work that you do and the business that you build that is good for you, and that's always going to be a somewhat unique shape from other businesses that have been built.

(01:32:54):
It's always going to rhyme with other things, but I think finding that unique shape, instead of just kind of cargo culting, like what you think a company should look like is definitely a much better way to be successful, and it's also a much better way to live.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:08):
I think this is going to hit hard with a lot of people who are listening, who are maybe founders or want to be founders, and this resonates with a lot of people that have been on this podcast sharing similar lessons. Dan, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks check out Every, find you online, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Dan Shipper (01:33:24):
So you can find us at every.to. I'm also on Twitter at @danshipper. You can go there to check out our products, our newsletter, if you want to stay on top of AI, all that kind of stuff. I also have a podcast. It's called AI and I.

(01:33:41):
You can find it on YouTube and on Spotify. And how can people be useful? Honestly, I think that the most useful thing for someone like me, based on what I want to do, is I want people to find interesting, cool ways to use AI that actually helps make their lives better. So just go do that, and tell me about it, and I think that'll be great, and so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:01):
What's the best way to tell you? Is it comments on your YouTube show? Is it emailing you, DM you?

Dan Shipper (01:34:05):
I would say tweet me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:08):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:34:09):
If you subscribe to Every, you can also reply to those emails, and they eventually get forwarded to me. So tweet me. Reply to Every. And if you want to comment on YouTube, great. I'm not in the YouTube comments as much as I should be, though.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:22):
Don't do that. Maybe don't do that.

Dan Shipper (01:34:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:25):
Okay. Well, Dan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for sharing. Thanks for being here.

## Transcript

David Placek (00:00:00):
Your brand name, nothing's going to be used more often or for longer than that name. Design will change, messaging will change, products will change, but that name is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):
What's a name that you came up with that you had to fight super hard for, that the client just hated?

David Placek (00:00:14):
When we presented Sonos, it was rejected because it's not entertainment-like. We argued about that because I said, "This is outside looking in, but I don't see you as an entertainment company." Humans do like to be comfortable. Part of our job here is to help people to give the confidence going bigger and being uncomfortable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
There's a quote that I found of yours, "If your team is comfortable with the name, chances are you don't have the name yet."

David Placek (00:00:37):
We look for polarization. We look for tension in a team arguing about these things. Polarization is a sign of strength in the word. Most clients, they come to a naming project absolutely believing with full confidence that they're going to know it when they see it, and the truth is it almost never happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Most people listening to this are founders, a lot of PMs on product teams. Let's say they have a couple of weeks, got to come up with a name. What should they do?

(00:01:05):
Today, my guest is David Placek. David is the founder of Lexicon Branding, which pioneered the field of brand naming, and invented a few names that you may have heard of including Powerbook, Pentium, Blackberry, Swiffer, the Impossible Burger. Also, Vercel, Windsurf, CapCut, and Azure. In our conversation, David opens up about the very specific process that he and his team go through to find winning names, including a simple exercise that you can do with you and your team to help you find the right name in just a few weeks. We also talk about why a great name is worth spending your time on, why you won't know a great name when you see it, and why you need to feel uncomfortable about the name first. Also, why big team brainstorms don't ever lead to great names. The stories behind names like Pentium, and Sonos, and Vercel, and Windsurf. Also, such interesting insights about the feeling and energy of every letter of the alphabet and so much more.

(00:01:56):
This episode is designed for anyone trying to figure out a name for their product or company, and also just for anyone that's interested in hearing the stories of how some of the most iconic names came to be.

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:03:45):
Last year, 1.3% of the global GDP flowed through Stripe. That's over $1.4 trillion. And driving that huge number are the millions of businesses growing more rapidly with Stripe. For industry leaders like Forbes, Atlassian, OpenAI, and Toyota, Stripe isn't just financial software. It's a powerful partner that simplifies how they move money, making it as seamless and borderless as the internet itself. For example, Hertz boosted its online payment authorization rates by 4% after migrating to Stripe. And imagine seeing a 23% lift in revenue like Forbes did just six months after switching to Stripe for subscription management. Stripe has been leveraging AI for the last decade to make its product better at growing revenue for all businesses, from smarter checkouts to fraud prevention and beyond. Join the ranks of over half of the Fortune 100 companies that trust Stripe to drive change. Learn more at stripe.com.

(00:04:48):
David, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

David Placek (00:04:53):
Thank you. I'm excited about today and looking forward to the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
Me, too. These are actually my favorite kinds of conversations because this topic is so outside of my wheelhouse, and I know I'm just going to learn a ton. Also, this is just something that every founder and product builder has to think about at some point, and they have no idea what they're doing. And then, their name becomes so core to their identity. It's hardly the word they say more than any other word. And I feel like I've never heard advice on how to do this well. So, I'm really excited for this conversation.

(00:05:25):
I'm going to just dive into a question. And the question is just what's a name that you came up with, and your team came up with, that you had to fight super hard for that the client just hated, and you ended up winning. And now, it's just such an obviously awesome name that everyone loves.

David Placek (00:05:40):
The story I like to tell is a story of Sonos. One, a great client team. I worked with all the founders. But at the time, they were stuck on being in a brand name that put them in the entertainment business. And so when we presented Sonos, which has many qualities to it, it was rejected because it doesn't have enough emotion to it. It's not entertainment-like. And we argued about that because I said, "This is outside looking in, but I don't see you as an entertainment company. You make speakers that allow for the flow of entertainment through these things. And Sonos is about sound." But it had a particular quality. It's called a palindrome, which really means that you can flip it and it means the same thing. In the case of Sonos, you could also turn it upside down and it was essentially the same.

(00:06:47):
And so that got them thinking about this, but they were still has... So I left that meeting in Santa Barbara, and I came back and they were still struggling with it. And I got on a plane, didn't even bill them for this, went back down to Santa Barbara and met with them again and said, "I really believe in this name and I think it's the right for you." And at a certain point, one of the founders, Bob MacFarlane, who's just a wonderful client. I could see him thinking, and he said, "You know? We're trying to name this for ourselves, and what we really should be doing is naming it for the marketplace and the customers. And I think Sonos now is the right name. And I felt really good about that." He later wrote me a note about how I help to do that, and we use it sometimes in credentials presentations because it's such a nice note.

(00:07:45):
But Sonos is something I'm so glad that I had this internal energy to, "I got to go down there and make a bid for this." I don't do that often, by the way, but I felt very strongly about Sonos.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:58):
I love Sonos. I love the name. I have many Sonos products. How often does this happen where the client is just, "No, this is not the name. We have this bigger vision, we have a whole other idea of it." And then you convince them.

David Placek (00:08:07):
Well, it happens all of the time. And it's a little bit bidirectional, right? Most clients, and I can understand this, they come to a naming project absolutely believing, with full confidence, that they're going to know it when they see it. And the truth is, it almost never happens. I think this year we'll hit 4,000 projects that we've completed.

(00:08:37):
And it's interesting, we'll tell people in a very polite way, "You're not going to know when you see it." But I know they don't believe me. And even when... You could see them thinking that, "You know what? He was right. I really have to think about this. I have to process it." And part of that, part of why clients don't like the bolder names, the more imaginative names that we present is they are looking for comfort. And that's the opposite that what you want to do. And part of our job here is to help people to give the confidence that going bolder, and bigger, and being uncomfortable. I use the expression, "There is no power in comfort, not in the marketplace."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:27):
Wow. There's so much here already. So this idea of you're not going to know it when you see it is something that people come in with thinking like, "Once I see it, it'll be obvious." Just why is that almost never the case? Is it because the name has to be something that is uncomfortable?

David Placek (00:09:43):
There's a lot of psychology to this, which ironically, I never even took a psychology class in college or graduate school. But the first element is humans do like to be comfortable. And one of the mechanisms of comfort is if something's been successful before, then I feel like I can approve it or select it. This is why movies like Harry Potter or even novels like Jack London's Call of the Wild get rejected so many times. I think Harry Potter was rejected 16 or 18 times, and Jack London's book even more than that. I mean, think about it. He's pitching a book and they say, "What are you talking about here? You're saying a dog becomes a wolf? I've never heard of anything like that." So, we really do have to help people think about, "It's not about the past. You're actually creating the future." And we really talk to people and emphasize the idea, "This isn't a name you're creating. We're creating an experience for you. We're going to work together."

(00:10:54):
And our conversations always start with, "Talk to us about how you behave now and how you want to behave in the future," as opposed to, "Tell me about your positioning, tell me about your values, tell me about your mission." That's really kind of old thinking. It's very traditional, and that did work 25 or 30 years ago. But this is a far more complex, interconnected world, a digital world now that stuff just doesn't create... It doesn't create names like Sonos or some of our other credentials that we probably will talk about today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):
Yeah, we're going to talk about just the process you guys go through, so stay tuned for that. But before we get to that, is there's another story you can share that shows this idea of being bold?

David Placek (00:11:44):
I'll talk about Microsoft's Azure. So when Microsoft came to us, they were pretty much stuck. And Microsoft does... And in many ways, to their credit, a lot of things don't need to be named. They don't need trademarks. They don't need brand names. They need descriptors. And so they came to us to develop a name that started or ended with cloud. Made sense to them because it was a cloud service. And our reaction was, "If you do that, you're going to be in an ocean of other cloud this, cloud that. And you have an opportunity as Microsoft here to really emerge as a leader in this." And so, there was a discussion about, "Okay, we'll take a look at those, but we'd like to see some cloud names." Which is easy to do, by the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:44):
Classic.

David Placek (00:12:42):
So, we did that. And along the way, we came up with this word azure, which is another word for blue. And so there was a link to clouds, blue sky clouds, things like that, but we really presented it based on its linguistic qualities. It's a noisy word, that Z in there. It starts with an A, and it ends in a nice smooth flow. So, we really strive to do create names that are balanced. And in a very busy competitive world, having a strong signal, which is generated by noise is a good thing.

(00:13:27):
The reaction wasn't good. One of the clients said, "That's just a dumb idea." Remarks like that. At this point, after these four decades, it just rolls off my back like water off a duck is what my grandmother would say. But I think along the way, as we talked about it, they began to warm up to this. And now of course it's, I don't know, a $100 billion brand or something like that. But that's an example of, "I haven't seen that before. I'm very comfortable with cloud. Cloud is what it is. We're describing it." But that's a statement. And I think that... Well, I don't think I know that's what I said in one of the presentations is, "You don't want to make a statement here. You want to start a story." And Azure is going to behave differently in the marketplace than Cloud Pro, which is I think one of the names that we presented to them on the other site at their request.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:34):
I'm glad they went with Azure. Let me actually ask this question. I know you're biased, but just how important is a great name? If you had a better name than a product that was better than you, does that make a big difference? Just anything you can share there to help people see this is the power of a great name.

David Placek (00:14:49):
Let's look just at the reality of this. Your brand name, whether it's a product name or a company name, nothing's going to be used more often or for longer than that name. Design will change, messaging will change, products will change, but that name is there. So, I like to talk about this idea of cumulative advantage. Over time, as people buy more and more of the product, they see it more often, that their bond between you and that brand, or them and the brand I should say, becomes stronger and stronger. So you want that name to stick in their mind to be distinctive, because distinctiveness is what creates that cumulative advantage.

(00:15:35):
The second thing is this notion of what I call asymmetric advantage. It makes perfect sense, and most clients agree with this when we say this is that even before you launch this brand, why not start with an advantage in the marketplace? And you won't get an advantage if you're descriptive. If you are Cloud Pro and there's 10 other cloud services, you're not going to stand out in the marketplace. You won't have the ability to create necessarily that cumulative advantage in the marketplace.

(00:16:09):
So, those are my two reasons why names are, I think, done right. And we do talk about our mission is not creating good names. A lot of people can do that. Our mission is to create the right name for clients, because the right name does deliver asymmetric advantage and cumulative advantage for you. And that, for us, has almost unlimited value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
This is a great answer. Essentially what you're saying is it's not going to necessarily make or break you, but it gives you an advantage. A great name gives you an advantage, especially if you're just getting started. You need every advantage you can get.

David Placek (00:16:54):
Exactly. And this is maybe a little bit off a tangent, but one of the best books on marketing I've ever read, which is not a book on marketing, and you may have read it along the way in college if you studied any Greek or classics. It's called the Melian Dialogues. And it's a dialogue... It'll take anybody listening to this maybe 25 minutes to read it. Between the Athenians and the government of Melos, the Athenians had decided that they needed that island. And they went and approached them very nice way, that, "We want to take over the island. Nothing will change. You'll be taxed a little bit, but we'll protect you." And the Athenians had thought every aspect about how to take that island before. So by the time they got there, they had created asymmetric advantage in terms of ships, and men, and all of this other stuff.

(00:17:57):
By the way, in the book, there's no mention of marketing or brand strategy or any of these things, but if you read it, you begin to see that it's marketing, really, is about a symmetric advantage. And so, why not start from the very beginning with an advantage? That's the value of a name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:12):
Let's dive into the actual process you guys go through, and I want to read a quote that Guillermo Rauch shared when I asked him about what it was like working with you. He's the CEO and co-founder of Vercel, which you guys worked with. I definitely want to hear that story, by the way. So he said, "Before David, the ability to name something was like charisma. You either have it or you don't. It was so surreal to watch his team distill it down to a science."

(00:18:35):
So let me just ask you, what does that science look like? What are the steps to coming up with an amazing name for your product or company that you guys go through?

David Placek (00:18:42):
That's very nice of Guillermo. He is a very impressive innovator in this category and we greatly enjoyed working with him. Well, our process is real. I break it down in three steps. First, we have to identify, then we invent, and then we implement. It's just three things. It's not rocket science, but it's a combination of creativity and discipline. And obviously, talented people and experience in these things. So, let's just go through those things. In the first section of identify, it's really trying to find out from the client, let's talk about behavior. So, how are you behaving now and how do you want to behave in the future? That behavior is bidirectional. In other words, the marketplace behaves towards a Vercel, that's the name we created for Guillermo. And they behave towards the marketplace. And that's an important point because everything... Buildings are bidirectional. Look at a building, you behave differently towards a temple than you or a church versus a Holiday Inn in terms of how that architecture states. So, we focus on that. Behavior is closely aligned for us with experience. How do you want the experience of this brand?

(00:20:11):
Now, when we listen to those things, we begin to think about rhythm of the name. So something like Dasani has a lot of rhythm to it, right? It's kind of calming. And so, we'll begin to extract things from that discussion on experience. We will then, also, as part of this first phase, look at the competition. We call that developing a landscape. And we're looking for what are the words... What are the brand names, first, and then what language are they using in this space? Because we have to be distinctive. If a brand name isn't distinctive, you lose. Then, you're imitating. And that's a form of suicide. That's a famous quote from some... I think the president of P&G 50 years ago or something like that. So, that's that first phase which allows us to create what we call a creative framework. And we don't even use the word objectives here because that gets too logical.

(00:21:16):
Actually, framework for us is a metaphor for a window for us, and our teams, and our linguists to travel through. To open things up so that we're not coming back with a narrow list of names. We're coming back with names that have depth, and breadth, and have different experiences and personalities to them. And clients will sign off on that. And then, we get going. So now, we're moved to the invent stage.

(00:21:44):
And in the invent stage, we do really two things. You can look at this as two layers of our process. I think the second layer is probably what makes us quite unique in the marketplace. It's the result of millions of dollars of R&D on our part. So the first thing is, no surprise to anyone, we work with creative individuals. And we don't use... This will be contrary. We don't use large brainstorming sections. I did. When I first started the company, I used freelancers, I used large brainstorming groups. And along the way through some analysis, we really discovered that that was not really working for us. That actually, the names were coming from employees and from small groups. And so we've moved our process to, at least, two or three small teams of two people.

(00:22:41):
And each of those teams... So let's say on significant projects, we always use three teams. And each team gets a different briefing. One team knows everything about the project but the other teams don't. If we're working for Microsoft, the second team thinks they're working for Apple. I mean, they know it's disguised. We're not keeping this from anyone. And then the third team, we take it out of computers, and they might be naming a bicycle or a car or something like that. What we're trying to do is open up the coffers of creativity for this. And so when people are working on what they know is not the real assignment, they are now free to make all kinds of mistakes. And so, most of our names have come out of the second or third team because they're-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:29):
Wow.

David Placek (00:23:29):
Yeah. I think the process, at some point, I will hopefully write either a good article on this or maybe even a book. But this process would work for, I think, a lot of things. I know it would. All right now, what's that second layer that I talked about? Well, we have made significant investments in this area of linguistics and cognitive science, and it's in two ways. One, building proprietary knowledge. So we know through research that we funded, an extensive amount about an area in language called or linguistics called the sound symbolism. So, what are the sounds of the 26 letters of the alphabet and what do they do? How do they evoke things? Well, it turns out that each of those letters sends out a signal that creates a certain sort of vibration, if you will, or experience.

(00:24:31):
Now, there's been research on that over the years but there were some gaps, and we decided to fill this. And over the years, we've had a very good relationship with Stanford University, with their Department of Linguistics. We've hired linguists from MIT, from Berkeley. We have a linguistic internship here. I actually just ran this number, preparing for this discussion. We have employed, over four decades now, 253 linguists. Most of them PhDs, some of them contracts, some of them actual employees. That's a lot of intellectual knowledge. So we really have, what I call, a linguistic engine here. And then we now have an operating network of... I just checked on this figure yesterday. We have 108 linguists in 76 countries that help us. Some of them do creative work, others will do just the analysis of names for us. So now, we have that creative framework, we have creative teams working on this.

(00:25:39):
Now, we're tapping into databases that have over 18,000 small word units, technically called morphemes. So, we also can tap in from a sound standpoint. What are the sounds of reliability? What are the sounds of aliveness? And so with Sonos, by the way, we wanted things that are somewhat noisy. And so S is a noisy letter, like a Z or even a V. And so, you begin to set priorities about what letters we're going to use. And that work from that, we call it an engineering layer floats up into the creative teams. And so, it's a mixture of things at a certain point in time.

(00:26:27):
All right. Now, what happens to all that? At a certain point, usually 3 to 4 weeks into this, we might have 2 or 3,000 ideas. I say ideas because they're not all solutions, they're not all workable. They may be just beginning ideas, concepts. And we sift through those. And now one of the major challenges that we face, and certainly our clients face, is the need to clear a trademark for it to be not in conflict with a marketplace that is... We're almost reaching a tipping point in terms of difficulty of clearing names here. And so we have paralegals here, and we have a trademark attorney, and we'll analyze those names. That gets us to a much smaller set. And then, we'll do our linguistic work with our linguists, and we end up with a set of names to show our clients.

(00:27:22):
We'll do this twice with most assignments. Sometimes, we'll do just one time depending on timing and budget. But we really try to get two cycles here, partly because humans love to compare. If you're looking for a house, you don't just look at the first house and say, "Okay, let's sign us up." You look and you learn that we don't need a swimming pool, but we do need a view. It's the same with names. And so, we get feedback from our clients. And sometimes, that's a co-creative process where a client will come up with a word or a solution and we'll then run that through our screening mechanisms for them. And that's really the process. The final phase is implementing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:08):
Let's actually pause at that because I would, so much, I want to talk about with the second step, but we'll get to the step three. They're just blowing my mind, all the things you guys do here. This is incredible. There's so many things here that are so unlike what I expected.

(00:28:23):
First of all, the creative folks that are actually coming up with these names, what's the background of these people? Who are these people?

David Placek (00:28:31):
So, the fundamental quality is they're going to be curious and they're going to be hardworking. This is... And hopefully... And this is hard to screen for, but lower egos. This is unlike the advertising business which I came from, so I've six years at a large agency. Where a creative person or a copywriter can think about something and come in with 3 or 4 alternatives in terms of a headline or body copy. And that might be refined a little bit and maybe sent back to the drawing boards altogether, but it's a relatively simple process. And no disrespect intended there.

(00:29:19):
Here, I can't just sit down and say, "Okay, we're naming a new car here. And so, I'm going to generate 100 names and you generate 100 names, and something will fall out." Those names will not... There's not enough in that list to clear through our screens. Of legal screens, our linguistic screens. And remember, we start with a creative framework and a criteria that the names need to meet. So, we're looking for people who can churn out a lot of work. And when that's rejected, they just keep going. So, we look for tenacious people. Now, we have... And we'll probably get to this later, but we have software here that helps people generate names. Not really... Maybe five years down the road, it'll actually spit out solutions, but now it's helping us to generate ideas and directions and what I... Sound symbolism, ideas, word unit, prefixes, suffixes, things like that. So, it's relatively easy for anyone that works here to develop a list of 2 or 300 names over a 3 or 4-day period.

(00:30:41):
Where do we find these people? More who are writers from newspaper reporters because they have to work fast. Their stories get rejected. People who might have written a novel. We have hired people from agencies over the years. They work a little less effectively than others who have a speechwriter from... I wrote speeches in Washington. Those people have to work hard, crank out a lot of material, get rejected. Candidate says, "I don't like this, start over." Those are more resilient people. That's where they come from. It's not easy to find these people. It really isn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:25):
Let me just throw out here. I'm going to ask you after we go through this process, what people that don't have the resources and time to do this, what they should do to come up with a good name. I'm just going to let people know as they're listening because-

David Placek (00:31:26):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:36):
... I imagine many people are wondering, but let's not go there yet.

David Placek (00:31:38):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:39):
How long does this process usually take? What's the ideal length the company should expect when they want to come up with an amazing name?

David Placek (00:31:44):
For us, the ideal link is pretty short. It's eight weeks. For larger corporate projects where you have boards and a little more politicking to do, and a few more presentations, it's a three-month churn. And sometimes by the time they approve things and clear, it's a four-months process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):
Okay, cool. So eight weeks mostly if you're a big company with a lot of red tape. You have to work through then longer.

(00:32:11):
Okay, this point you made about three different teams with different almost context is so interesting. So say, let's use Windsurf as an example, which is an amazing name, killing it, that you guys helped come up with. So is the idea there, okay, here's we're naming this AI IDE. One of the team has told, "No, you're building a bicycle. Here's all the same brief, but it's a bicycle. And then another team, you're building a..." I don't know, lap. I don't know, something non-technical essentially, right?

David Placek (00:32:42):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:43):
Like, a cup. Say more about that because that is amazing because. And you're finding that most of the best names come from the groups that aren't... Let's name an amazing AI IDE.

David Placek (00:32:54):
This is a good example. So in technology, there are some things that if someone hands you a new phone and you look at it and it's tangible and it's got a shape and color, things like that, easier to name. But the name of Windsurf, before it was Windsurf, was Codium. So, it's all about a type of code or a process for coding. That's intangible. And even though we do an awful lot of technology work, it is still hard for us to really get ahold of what that is. So our rule here is if there's something that is intangible like that, we have to make it tangible. And sometimes we do that not by giving a team, sometimes it's an individual, the assignment to create ideas for the brand itself, but to just dive into a particular context.

(00:33:49):
And in this case with Windsurf, this is about flow about giving people that are coding something much more of a flow process, a smoother process, a more dynamic process. So in that case, One team was just given the task of we want to look at a list of all the things that can communicate either in a real word like flow or metaphorically or in a sport about that kind of dynamics. That kind of movement. And there was Windsurf sitting on a list. I mean, sometimes, this is really just that simple. Of course, you have to have the right framework and you have to give the right directions to someone. And Windsurf, for us and particularly for me, it checks all the boxes. It's a wonderful image, it's an experience. Literally, a physical experience. It's a compound, right? Two words put together. We know from the research we've invested in that compounds like Powerbook or Facebook are multipliers of associations because there's wind and there's circles around that, and then there's surf images around that. So 1 + 1 = 3, right?

(00:35:16):
It's interesting that when we present compounds to clients, we often get the comment, "Well, it's a little bit long and it's a compound. I'd rather have a shorter single word." And then that's why we actually did research on just how effective our compounds so we could pass that information along. We passed that along to the team at that time. Codium, by the way, could not have been a more intelligent, nicer, more respectful team that we've worked with. I'm so glad for their success. But we explained to them about the multiplier effect of compounds. We showed them imagery that they could use. I mean, it's simple to execute on something like that. And so, that's how that came about. I'll stop there and see if you need more information or not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:11):
Let me actually follow this through real quick. It's going to be kind of a tangent. You guys have been working with AI companies more and more recently, which is so interesting. What's different about naming AI products from traditional products, not AI, I guess?

David Placek (00:36:25):
First off, we are working mostly with engineers, and engineers who haven't delved into the world of creativity and necessarily marketing. And that's their strength. And what we have to do is we have to balance their strength with our strength. So there's a little bit of a challenge there, but I think we deal pretty well with that. Secondly, this is the fastest moving progressing category I have ever experienced. And I have that perspective, right? I went through the early days of the internet and the World Wide Web, and that was moving pretty fast. But the internet compared to this looks like a daycare school or something like that. We're challenged by just keeping up with developments. Third thing, and this is the creative challenge here, is that engineers come to us wanting more sophisticated names where they are likely to end up with another Codium or an Anduril or an Anthropic.

(00:37:42):
And when we saw this trend of that AI is going to take off, and it was an intuitive feeling on my part. I could have been wrong. I said, "Let's find out what's going on here." So both, not only who's developing the products, but how do people think about AI? And we did a series of research. I probably invested $20,000 or so. And we interviewed consumers in Europe, South Korea, just picked out one country in Asia, and in America, and developers in those three. And they really have different views. Developers are all totally positive on it. They see the future, they see a big future, not too concerned, some are, but most aren't. Consumers are skeptical, worried about it, worried about their jobs, see the hope in it, those types of things, but haven't got the handle on it.

(00:38:41):
So Codium is an example where we said, "We think what you're doing needs to be much more tangible, and something that people can grab onto, and much more natural as opposed to a Codium." And they listened to us. Very simple as that. And in this case, we were right. And by the way also, I have to say, there's some luck to this. Windsurf happened to be available and they sought right away, not exactly right away but it took about a week going back and forth to select it. So, let me stop there and see if that answers your question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
Absolutely. And it feels like most AI companies end up having a different name for their product than their company. I've noticed this funny trend cursor was any sphere bold with stack is StackBlitz, Windsurf is Codium. Basically, everyone.

(00:39:37):
When does it make sense to change your name? Windsurf just officially changed their entire company name to Windsurf from Codium. It was just a product. So, let me just ask you that. When does it make sense? It feels like a huge deal and a very challenging thing to do.

David Placek (00:39:48):
It is challenging. And the larger you are and the more customer base you have, it becomes a significant project. So the first thing is you have to make an argument that it's worth the change. That we're going to be better off by changing our name. So, there's a couple situations where you want to change your name. First one is let's focus first on startups. Startups get going early, they get into Y Combinator or something like that, they're raising money. And they just need a name. And although they know what they're doing, and that may change by 10 or 15 degrees, it's almost like, "We just got to have a name." And that is the absolute expression I hear from when a startup calls and says, "We want to change your name. We started off a year and a half ago. We just needed a name for the documents, and so we chose X." And it's not a very good name. So, that's example number one.

(00:40:53):
Number two is the company actually has pivoted. And so, the name that they have no longer really reflects who they are or who they're becoming, and which makes that name ineffective. And the third is that a company has merged and it is time now to create a new start and reflect to the marketplace that we're... We're new now, maybe bigger, but certainly we have more capabilities and we want you to know about it. And because of that, we're changing our to blank, which reflects those capabilities at some level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:38):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Andrew Luo (00:41:45):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:47):
So, what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing, and mapping, and integrating CSV in Excel files.

Andrew Luo (00:42:03):
Yes. So, we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV in Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:29):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema.

Andrew Luo (00:42:37):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:58):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co, That's oneschema.co.

(00:43:12):
I want to come back to this linguist piece, which I know is really unique to the way you guys operate, and it's so interesting. So you employed, you've said, over 250 linguists over the course of your business career. This linguist step, the way you described it is they're not coming up with names, they're more kind of like a filter for, "Here's all the names we've come up with. Here's the ones that are good linguistically." Is that right? Or is that team also suggesting names?

David Placek (00:43:35):
Yeah. Some of the people there, depending on the assignment, will actually help us create names, for sure. And so, we have linguists here. And in the network, we have linguists. And those linguists are contracts to us, not full-time employees. So, there's a little bit of both. But the preponderance of their work in our linguistic network is to evaluate names. Not only just does it mean something negative or positive, but are there cultural implications to it? Political implications? Or even things that a natural disaster that would've happened somewhere that no one here would know about. Even if we had, if.

(00:44:21):
This was in Italy, and there was a bridge or a flood that killed a lot of people. Someone that speaks Italian very well here, say at Berkeley University, but has lived here for 20 years, wouldn't know about that. And we don't want anything linguistically that would slow our clients down. And so, that's why we've invested in building this network. We have a woman that runs the network for it. So, it's not an insignificant facet of our business that we have to run and manage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:52):
Is there a name you love that didn't pass the linguistic filter, that ended up being like, "Oh, shit. That's a really bad name in this culture"?

David Placek (00:45:00):
It happens frequently where we will find something that isn't really terrible but it's worrisome to us. It's interesting cultures like Australian or people in Australia, they have a lot of interesting expressions. And so, we do find things that this sounds like it's a certain kind of shrimp and things like that, and we eliminate those things. And then we find things that have sort of sexual connotations, we eliminate those.

(00:45:39):
I would say it happens every third or fourth project we'll find something that we will eliminate and never show the client.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):
And something you love and you're like, "Okay, I guess we can show that one"?

David Placek (00:45:52):
That's true. That happens. It does.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:55):
You also said this really interesting thing about how every letter of the alphabet has a vibrance in an experience. Can you give a few examples of that? I know you're not the person doing that work specifically, but just what are some letter feelings?

David Placek (00:46:11):
The work is from the linguist, but at this point, I'm pretty adept in it. So, let's look at... I'll start with the letter V because it is so illustrative of what this is about. V, from our research that we've done, is the most alive and vibrant sound in the English alphabet. And that's whether you were born in Rome or in Sausalito, California. So if you know that, if you know that as you go around the world, there are going to be some exceptions to it. It's going to have that vibrancy. Look at Corvette. They probably didn't know about V, but it's a perfect name for a car that's fast and has a big engine that roars. Think about Viagra, same idea. And there's been surprises to us. B, the sound of the letter B is one of the most reliable sounds in the English alphabet. That was one of our rationales, by the way, for Blackberry. Because that's another example of a client who thought we were... I mean, the founder actually said, "I thought the people at Lexicon were crazy," when they presented Blackberry.

(00:47:29):
And we said, "Well, let's stop and look at some of the assets here. First off, black color's technology. Yes, not everybody knows the word berry, but we have those two Bs." We talked about the nature of a compound. And all of a sudden, people at least lean forward to consider it as opposed to rejecting it too fast. So, those are just two examples. I mentioned Z in Azure, that's noisy letter. X is fast and crisp as a sound. And of course, there's semantic value to all of these letters, too. X is about innovation from aircraft to computers. And so, you have to look at the semantics of it and the sound symbol of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:15):
This is so fascinating. I could listen to this stuff all day. Just thinking about Vercel with the V, that very aligns with what they're trying to do. Just very strong, opinionated way of working. And Guillermo, he feels like a V person.

David Placek (00:48:29):
He is. And there's an example of a group that had a lot of confidence, and what their product is is very innovative. And so, we had permission there to create something new because Vercel is a coin solution., right? But notice that we put some very simple, easy to process things together there. Or ver, in this case. So we have in vino veritas, truth in wine, things like that. You have verde, green. So, very familiar. And then their cel, like accelerate, something which is really what they do. They accelerate a client's performance. So, that was a relatively easy name for us to present and we were excited about for them to grasp.

(00:49:26):
By the way, that's known as processing fluency, which is when you think about how the brain processes information. We're told by a number of cognitive science that our brains are a little bit on the lazy side. We don't like complex things. And so, we really strive to make all of our solutions relatively easy for the brain to process. So it wants, it leans in towards them as opposed to, "I'm too busy. I'm walking past that." Names that are complicated, it's a liability. And we really avoid that. But Vercel, perfect fluency.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):
Okay, let's go back, actually, to the three steps. So we covered two, and it took us on a long tangent to dive into a lot of the stuff you shared with the second step, which you call invent. So, it's essentially the three steps are... Was it create? What would you call it? The step?

David Placek (00:50:26):
Yeah, it's identify. Invent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:27):
Identify.

David Placek (00:50:29):
And I use the word invent with intention because it's more than creative. And then the final thing is implement. Now for us, we're not a design firm. We're really focused on brand names and the nomenclature that supports the name. But for us, implement is helping the client team, if they choose, for us to help them with the presentations as it goes up the chain. To help them write a longer rationale for why these names, if they're presenting three names to the president of their company or the CMO, why these names make a lot of sense, and to help them develop what we call prototypes. So we'll put the name on a baseball cap, on a T-shirt. We'll put the name in a mock-up ad in the Wall Street Journal. Something's very positive. Because of Procter & Gamble's new blank product. P&G shares, they gain 10% this year. So that executives can see that the lift that that name can have. That's our implementation phase for them.

(00:51:44):
And we also do consumer research or customer research at that stage, and we do that probably about 50% of the time on our projects where we're going out and we're really talking to their customers, and putting the names in a series of drills. Drills that make them not the marketing person for the day, but we're really making these customers feel that this is a new brand. And then, we're asking about expectations. We're seeing how these names fire their imagination. And that's the most important thing in research, not is the name popular, are they comfortable with it, does it fit to concept. If you're asking people is this fit to concept, you are inevitably always going to get a descriptive name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):
You make such a good point about how you need to arm the people working with you with ammo to win over other folks internally. Because if the person working with you is on board and the name is bold and not an obvious winner, I could see it being important to be like, "Here's what you should all show them to help them see the story, and the mock-ups, and all of that."

David Placek (00:52:53):
Yes. And what's really important is to help their management see this in the context of the marketplace and their customers. This is a very human thing, but people want their boss to be happy. They want to be okay with their boss. And so they're thinking about, "I don't know if my boss would like this." He's more conservative or she's more conservative. We try in a very diplomatic way to say, "This has nothing, really, in the end to do with your boss. It has to do with the marketplace."

(00:53:27):
Well, that's easy for me to say because I'm not working at a P&G or an Intel, but we really try to give that advice for it because it is about being successful in the marketplace. And so first of all, we try to separate the clients that we work with. We really want to work with clients that play to win, that want to win, not just want to not lose in a marketplace. And so, we try to encourage our direct clients to lead the process to really say, if a manager or a CMO or a president says, "Look, we're the team that's going to execute on this and we believe in this. We can make this work," they usually rally around it. They usually do. But if you're just taking names up to a manager and saying, "What do you think?" There's a different outcome offered.

(00:54:28):
So, we like to be in that implementation phase because we have so much experience. And usually, credibility with people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:37):
And you said that you come up with 3 to 4,000 names. That's the top of the funnel?

David Placek (00:54:41):
Yeah. And just to clarify that, it's ideas, directions. It's not-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:50):
Complete ready-to-ship names.

David Placek (00:54:51):
Yeah, not ready-to-ship names at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):
Got it.

David Placek (00:54:54):
This is a very inefficient process and a little chaotic. So in that list of 3,000 names is probably 250 potential diamonds that have to be fractured and examined.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:10):
I really want to see just a documentary of this process at some point. This is the closer we're going to get for now, but this is so interesting.

(00:55:17):
I want to ask about how you would approach this if you're just a startup that doesn't have the time or resource to do this. But before I do that, is there anything else around the process that you guys go through with clients that you think is important to share or they think might surprise people?

David Placek (00:55:30):
I think we've covered it. I do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):
Okay, great. Awesome. Okay, so most people listening to this, there's a lot of founders, a lot of PMs on product teams. They're working on a new feature, they're about to launch a product, they got accepted into YC and they're about to launch a product. Then they have, I don't know, let's say they have a couple of weeks. We've got to come up with a name. What should they do?

David Placek (00:55:50):
So the first thing I do is to say, okay, let's forget about developing the name for right now. And I will have them, and I think this is a good exercise for anybody. We do it here internally when we think about our business. So I say, just... Because most of this now, because of COVID, is on video. And I will say, "Just draw a shape of a diamond on a piece of paper in front of you." And I said, "On the top of that diamond, put the word win. How do you define winning is really it?" I said, "Now on that other next corner of the diamond, what do you have to win? Write that down. On the bottom, what do you need to win? And then on that final angle on the left-hand side, what do you have to say to win?" Then I said, "Now, let's go all the way to that final thing of what do you have to say to win."

(00:56:49):
And that's where you just get people thinking about, "Well, what we really have here is... And we're better than this." And then I'll just say, "Okay. Now, what you want to take that this really should be about experience and behavior. How do you want to behave in the marketplace? How do you want the marketplace to behave towards you? And what kind of experience are you creating?" And then they'll start talking a little bit. I'll say, "Now, you just need to probe on that. You need to keep going. You need to look at metaphors because this is about experience." And I'll just give them some of our examples that we've talked about, "Blackberry, it says to the marketplace, they're not like the other guys." Think of something like Google versus Infoseek, right? Google is an experience. Google says, "I don't know what these guys are going to do, but it's not this practical mundane Infoseek." And that's what attracts people.

(00:57:54):
And so I'll do a little coaching like that, and then that usually kind of sets them free. And they're now thinking about it not as a word, which has maybe limited value, but as creating an experience which has the potential for unlimited value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:12):
Okay. So, let me try to reflect this back for folks. So the advice is draw triangle. So, you're coming up with a name. Draw triangle. At the top, win. At the bottom-left, was it how do you win?

David Placek (00:58:25):
Yeah. So, the diamond is two triangles.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:27):
Oh, diamond. Okay, I see. I have triangle in my mind.

David Placek (00:58:28):
I got you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):
Okay, got it. Diamond. Great.

David Placek (00:58:31):
And so on that next angle there on the right side is, what do you have to win already? Right? Because they wouldn't be either in a Y Combinator or getting some seed money if they didn't have something to win. And often, people, startups don't appreciate how much they actually do have to win because they're so busy and so stressed on what they're doing. And then, what do they need to win? And then finally, what do you need to say? And then back up to defining what is winning to us? Which, by the way, we start with that question usually on an assignment that we've been awarded. And if we're in a room with five people, all five people have a different definition of what... Their definition of that company winning. And that's good to sort that out because we can move down different avenues from a creative standpoint.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:31):
Let's just make sure people have these phrases because this is awesome. And I imagine many people are going to be taking notes and like, "Cool. I'm going to do this." I hope so say the four points of the diamond again just so folks can write it all down.

David Placek (00:59:42):
At the top of the diamond is just the word win, and underneath that is how do we define winning for us as a company. And that can start off being simple, like we want to be the dominant player here. But you really have to work at that. What does that really mean, right? The second on that right-hand tip there of the diamond is what do we have to win? What are we doing now that makes us a winner? Then we go down to the bottom of the diamond, and it's what do we need to win? There could be technical things there. People talk about talent and resources. Often there, they'll say, "We need a good name." We always correct that. It's not the good name, it's the right name.

(01:00:28):
And then finally is what do we need to say? And that's where I say, that's where you want to spend some time in really thinking about all the things you need to say, that you can say or you would even like to say, which maybe right now you can't say. But you want to a name that actually is going to have the flexibility as to when you can say that, it still works. And that gets them into behavior and experience. And that usually launches a really a good discussion with founders internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:03):
When you say you have to win though, what you're thinking about there is what is it that you have that will help you win? And then what is it you need to have this win?

David Placek (01:01:10):
Yes, that's right. And all companies are in that same situation. They have a bunch of stuff, but they need... A P&G might say, "We need a good distributor."

(01:01:19):
"Okay. All right, we'll put that on the list."

(01:01:24):
And then you might say, "Well, we need in..." When it gets to what do we have to say, we have to say the right things so that a distributor is interested in us. And then you go down an avenue there. Well, what is that? And if you work at it, this is not a one-hour exercise, it may be an exercise repeated over the next 4 or 5 days.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):
Okay. So, you have this diamond. And then the idea is just sit and put names down in a Google Doc, let's say.

David Placek (01:01:55):
Yeah. And then you start. But there is this... And maybe, it's naivete. I guess, that's probably the best word for this is that, because I do hear this all of the time. "Hey, we've worked at this, we got a list of 200 names, but we don't think there's something there."

(01:02:19):
And I'll say, "Well, 200 names is not enough. Get to 1,000, 1,500 names and directions. Don't evaluate them. Just generate names, and directions, and ideas, and then have a meeting. And don't evaluate but speculate." What could we do with this name? What's the potential here? There's a lot of overevaluation in our industry. It makes sense. We survive as humans because we figure out what's wrong with this picture. If I want to cross the street, is it safe to cross the street? What's going on? Those kinds of things. You have to counter that. You have to say, "Let's just suspend judgment for a while. And let's do an exercise here where we take these 10 names that we think might work and what are we going to do with it." Because it's how you execute.

(01:03:21):
Going back to windsurf, as we showed them pictures of people windsurfing and waves and things, if they said, "Ah, that just doesn't work for us at all. I'm very uncomfortable with." Well, then it's not their name. But they leaned into it, "Okay, I can see this. It's easy for us to execute. It's dynamic, it's different." So, that's why we build these prototypes for people. And that's what... I think the best advice I can give to whether it's a startup or someone starting a new cookie company, is it's not just a list of 200 names. It's 10 or 15 lists of 200 names. And it's thinking about what do we have to say here? What behavior? How do we want people to feel in the marketplace about us? I imagine with Google, people felt relief that it wasn't a descriptive name. That there was something new out there in the marketplace.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):
Yeah. Infoseek, that's such a descriptive name now that I think about it.

David Placek (01:04:23):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:24):
Okay, so one more question along these lines. So say, you have a list of let's say 2,000 or 1,000 names. There's this tension between choosing something... Like, as a person that is doing them themselves. Your advice is choose something bold, not something descriptive. You won't know it when you see it. Very hard to do, obviously, when you're doing it by yourself. And you just advise for not losing sight of that piece. Just throwing out things that feel too scary, finding a name that's actually bold as you suggest.

David Placek (01:04:55):
First off, we disappear... Human psychology, humans only pay attention to what is new or what is different, I should say. So if you're looking at shoes and they're all black, black, black, black, and then the next pair of shoes is red, that's the first thing you focus on. And so, that usually gives people permission. They'll say, "Okay, I get that." So, look for what is really different between the names that you have on your list, but also what's different from what's out in the marketplace. Then you get a client like Microsoft saying, "Azure is different. There's going to be a lot of cloud stuff and..." There's a relevant point there, Azure is blue. And so, there's a slight logical connection that I think gave them more permission to move forward with it, frankly. But listen, this is not an easy task. I mean, that's why we're in this business, and why I felt we should be specialized because if you start doing design and/or advertising or other things, you can't have the intellectual engine.

(01:06:16):
You can't acquire the intellectual engine that we have. So I know it's difficult, but it can be done, and you just have to give yourself some time. But stop evaluating. Suspend judgment and speculate. That's my number one advice to people trying to do this on their own. Now, how can you get help? You can talk to your employees, but it's not so much, "What do you think of this name?" It's, "What do you think this name could do for us?" That's a much better question. If you go out and talk to friends who don't work for your company, there's a fun drill that I suggest. I said, "Listen, go out to them and say..." They'll know what you're doing. And say, "You know what? We just have a new competitor and their name is blank. What do you think about that?"

(01:07:10):
What happens there is you're not asking them to give you an opinion to evaluate a name. You're asking them then what does that name do for you? The information you're getting is that name, they're telling you what that name does for them, how it helps them to imagine, which is a fundamental role of any name. Slight tangent, but I'm going to go to our kind of research. We do mostly quantitative research now, but for years, we did qualitative work. And we still do. But what we found in, we were always looking for the...

(01:07:49):
I'll set it this way. We were always looking for this answer from consumers. If a consumer said, "I don't really know much about that new product, but I know that they're not like the other guys." That's when we knew we had a good name because they were... Now what happened there? I mean, the technical term that we use is that name will create a predisposition to consider this product because they're not like the other guys, as opposed to, "I already have something like that. I'm busy. I don't need another one of those things. I need something new and different, and hopefully better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):
That's awesome. That's a good reminder. There's a quote that I found of yours that's exactly along these lines, "If your team is comfortable with the name, chances are you don't have the name yet."

David Placek (01:08:38):
Yes. And by the way, the opposite of that is we look for polarization. We look for tension in a team about arguing about these things, because we think that polarization is a sign of strength in the word. And interesting story, the person who taught me that, honestly, was Andy Grove over the Pentium name, because... And I learned a lot from him. I always say this, I just was very fortunate to work with him on Pentium, and Xeon, and a few other things. But when we went to an executive committee to present Pentium... And by the way, internally, one of the names that... And makes sense here, descriptive, bunch of engineers, ProChip. "Hey, it's professional, it's premium, and it's chipped. So, it should be Prochip." So Andy had me give a presentation about the strengths of this thing, and he said, "Now, let me tell you why I think this is the right name."

(01:09:56):
He said, "Because I see the polarization here in it amongst people. There's this ProChip over here, there's the Pentium thing." He said, "That tells me there's energy for Pentium here." And he said, "That's why I think we should go with it." And I've never forgotten that. And so, we do look for that. And when we tell that story, people say, "You're right. There is... I mean, we are arguing about this, and there is an intensity with the name." And that's what you want. You don't want to go out in the marketplace, into this very competitive marketplace, regardless of the category, with something that doesn't have a level of boldness or intensity.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:33):
That was an amazing story. Just again, so kind of a tip here is if half of your team or, I don't know, some percent of your team hates it, some percent of your team loves it, that's a good sign.

David Placek (01:10:43):
Yeah, it is. It is. Look for that polarization. That's what we look for.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:47):
I also love this tip of asking people if, "Hey, our competitor just launched. They're called Windsurf." How your team reacts? If they're just like, "Oh, wow, that's a great name. I'm interested in that product." That's what you want to look for?

David Placek (01:10:59):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:02):
How important is the .com for the name you come up with? I imagine it's really hard to get these days. Just what do you think about domain name when you think about naming?

David Placek (01:11:10):
I am so glad you asked this question because at this point, it doesn't really matter at all. The .com or URL address has become an area code. And whether you're in 415 or 615, it doesn't really matter to people. And now with AI, SEO is going to be less important. And so, I just think the principle in play here is you got to get the right name first. And then if you can get the .com, sure, go ahead. But if you can't, there's ways around that. You can put a prefix in front of it or a little word in front of it or after it, or you go to .ai or something like that. But the principle in play is let's get the right name first.

(01:12:02):
For those who really... And there are people who really get hung up on the .com, they tend to older by, the way. And have, in their mind, sort of the hotness of the internet and having a .com, which did make a difference 25 years ago. But it's 25 years now or 30, right? The good news is because they're less valuable, you can typically buy a URL if you negotiate the right way and have time for 15, 20, 25, $30,000. And we say, "Hey, if you can do that, have fun. I'd put the $30,000 into market."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):
Awesome. That's reassuring. I imagine many founders are just like, "God dammit, there's no names available anymore." Let me zoom out and just ask you this question as a, maybe, a closing thought to our conversation.

(01:12:56):
Say you were just in an elevator ride with someone, and I'm sure this happens to you of just like, "Hey, David, I got to come up with that name. What's your biggest tip for coming up with a great name?" What would your answer be?

David Placek (01:13:06):
I'd go back to forget about the word, think about behavior and experience. And then the second thing from just a creative help, I'm a big believer in synchronicity. And we try to force synchronicity here, and I'll give you a couple examples of that. But this idea of connecting dots, two unrelated ideas together. And so I'll say, "Look, if someone says we make sailboats and I'm trying to..." I'm here in Sausalito. I guess, that's why I thought about that. And I am trying to create a new name for my company that builds sailboats.

(01:13:49):
I would say forget about sailboats. I would go and pick out some magazines about hunting or flying magazines. And I would just look through those, get a notepad out, and put out words that you like. Things, expressions that you like. And then that synchronicity, I said, "I would bet you $5 that out of those two magazines, you will get a word that you never would've thought of, but somehow it would relate to sailing."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:25):
That connects very much to your story of how you have these different teams, and the teams that end up coming up with a winning name are the ones thinking about a very different version of that product.

David Placek (01:14:35):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:36):
So interesting. Okay. David, this was everything I was hoping it'd be. I feel like we're going to help so many people. Is there anything that we haven't covered or that you want to leave listeners with as a final nugget or piece of advice or story before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

David Placek (01:14:55):
I'm going to emphasize one point, I think, which is that I really would like the listeners to really begin to think about how valuable a brand name can be. That you're not just looking for a word, you're looking for this experience. And if you get it right, not just a good name but the right name, the value is almost unlimited. And so give yourself some time, give yourself a budget, give yourself the right resources to do that. Second thing is we try to really be helpful here, and so I am always happy to talk to people about where they are in a process and if we can help, or just give them a little bit of advice. And we schedule, we call them office hours here. We're judicious about it, but we are open to that. It's just playing a long-term game, so I'd like to leave that with the viewers also.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:51):
We're about to book out your office hours. I love that offer. I think a lot of people are going to take advantage of that. That is super cool.

(01:15:58):
David, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

David Placek (01:16:03):
Yes, I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:05):
There we go. What are 2 or 3 books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

David Placek (01:16:09):
There's a book called Resilience, which was written by a former Navy SEAL that... And it's not about combat, it's just a tiny bit about being a SEAL. But it is about overcoming things and it's about tenacity. And I think everybody in the world, we all have challenges and things. And I do recommend that to people.

(01:16:31):
Second book is Andrew Roberts latest book on Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill is, really, one of my heroes. He was one of the most unusual, provocative statesmen/politicians of the 20th century. And here's another person that talked about tenacity, and ups and downs, and stick with it. And so, I do like to recommend that. Some people just tipped their head and said, "Ah, I don't know." It seems like maybe a boring book, but those are two books that I [inaudible 01:17:02].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):
Who would ever say that Churchill's story is boring? That's absurd.

David Placek (01:17:07):
I think so. I agree. I agree It's absurd, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
He's so fascinating. There's a recent documentary, I think, that really showed me the character. Incredible.

(01:17:18):
Okay. What's a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

David Placek (01:17:20):
For me, it's the Yellowstone series. We're very fortunate as a family, we have some property in Montana. And-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:29):
Oh, wow. You're living the life.

David Placek (01:17:31):
Yeah, very... Listen, I can't tell you how fortunate I am. And I bought this property 28 years ago, so it was a lot cheaper then.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:31):
Wow.

David Placek (01:17:40):
In a snowstorm, and it just felt right. But I think particularly the 1883, the precursor to Yellowstone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:48):
I was going to ask if you saw that because that was incredible.

David Placek (01:17:50):
Yes. And then the after one, 1923, which is the post-war. 1883 really gives people a sense of what it took by those early Americans to build a life in a place like... A beautiful place but a hard, tough place like Montana. And it's just phenomenal. The person producing and writing those things is incredibly talented. Taylor Sheridan, I think, is his name.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):
I love that in the story, Montana was the easy route almost from the journey they want on.

David Placek (01:18:24):
That's right. It's very, very true, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):
Oh, man. Yeah, you almost don't even need to watch Yellowstone. Just starting with 1883 totally works.

David Placek (01:18:32):
Yeah. In fact, I recommend people. I say there's three. But if you really want the truth about the American West, it's 1883.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:40):
Yeah. I suggested that on this podcast a bunch, actually. So, I love that. That's where you went.

(01:18:45):
Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love? Maybe one you named, maybe not.

David Placek (01:18:51):
I didn't name it, although it's got a very good name to it. Our whole family, I have two daughters and my wife, we're all fly fishermen, and last summer I really... I bought this for myself, but I gave it to my wife. It was one of those things that was present for her, but I knew I was going to use it more. And it's a Hardy. It's an old British fly rod, but it's a beautiful rod. It's just perfect for the big rivers of Montana. So, that's my favorite purchase.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:20):
That's the first fly-fishing rod of the podcast. Excellent choice.

(01:19:24):
Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends or family?

David Placek (01:19:31):
I do. And it's a little longer, so I wrote it. I have it written here somewhere, but it's the quote from T.E. Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia, here. And if I can find it, I should be. I think it's a wonderful quote, so I think hopefully your viewers will like this. Here's what he said. He said that, "All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men for they may act on their dreams with open eyes to make them possible."

(01:20:14):
I read that years ago and it just hit me pretty hard, so yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):
That is an amazing quote. It makes me think about the quote about the man in the arena.

David Placek (01:20:25):
Yes. Yeah, it's same idea. It's just a little different. And I also think Lawrence of Arabia is a fascinating person, what he did. So, inspiring in some ways.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:38):
An amazing movie.

(01:20:40):
Okay, final question. Let me just try this. Is there a name that you didn't name that you're just like, "Wow, that was an amazing name. I wish I had come up with that name"?

David Placek (01:20:49):
I'll tell you there is one name, and it's DreamWorks. I think it's a wonderful name, and it's somewhat ironic that the entertainment industry in general has pretty mundane names. You have all of these talented people. And yet when you look at the names of production studios, movie houses, Comcast, things like that, it's very mundane. But here's DreamWorks, just like Sonos, check all the boxes. Compound dream. You expect something great from DreamWorks. They've created an experience, the experience of dreaming in a movie. I think it's a wonderful name. I wish I'd done it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:39):
That's such a cool answer. David, thank you so much for doing this. This was incredible. I learned a ton as I imagined. I feel like a lot of people are going to have a much easier time thinking about approaching this topic.

David Placek (01:21:50):
Well, I certainly hope so. I do. It's been very, very enjoyable, very thoughtful, and I have nothing but or respect for the way you do this and the talent that you have. So, very fortunate that we've come together. And we live in the same place, so maybe we can get together for a cup of coffee or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:10):
We do. Northern California for the win. Thank you so much for being here.

David Placek (01:22:14):
You're very welcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:16):

# Succeeding as an introvert, building zero-to-one, and PM’ing your career like a product | Deb Liu

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of.

Deb Liu (00:00:11):
Some of the best PMs I have ever worked with are terrible PMs for their career. They just drift from job to job. "Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what does success look like? How are you going to get there?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
You wrote this awesome post about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert.

Deb Liu (00:00:28):
The workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. It looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because it's self-promotion. But instead, what if I called it educating about all the great work your team has been doing? Helping people see why your team should get more resources, you have to actually share what you do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Is there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe?

Deb Liu (00:00:49):
The most important career decision you make is who you marry. Is this person lifting you up or pushing you back? You will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Deb Liu. Deb was VP of product at Facebook where she spent over 11 years and while they're created and led Facebook marketplace, which is now used by over 1 billion people monthly, she also led the development of Facebook's first mobile ad product for apps and its mobile ad network. Also built the company's games business and payments platform, including Facebook Pay.

(00:01:23):
Prior to Facebook, she was director at both PayPal and eBay. She's on the board of Intuit and for the past three and a half years, she's been the CEO of Ancestry. I actually generally have a rule of no CEOs on this podcast, but to me, Deb is a great exception because she's a product person at heart. In our conversation, Deb shares a ton of tactical career advice, including why resilience is so key to career success, how to PM your career like you PM your product, how to be successful in business as an introvert, what she's learned about building multiple billion dollars zero to one businesses within a large company like Facebook and so much more.

(00:01:59):
Deb is so full of wisdom and I'm really excited to share her insights with more people. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Deb Liu.

(00:02:18):
Deb, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Deb Liu (00:02:21):
It's wonderful to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:23):
It's wonderful to have you here. You have had such an incredible career. You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of and honestly just like one of those roles is a dream for a lot of people. And so I wanted to start with just this question and I want to see where the conversation takes us. If you could give one specific piece of advice to someone that's looking to do well in their career or to do better in their career based on what has worked well for you, what would that be?

Deb Liu (00:03:02):
Always be learning, and I tell this to everybody, so I often tell people, someone who's always learning is always going to exceed someone who's the expert today. You're going to find people... The one thing about school is that we go to school and there's such a thing as getting a hundred on the test, a perfect score on the SAT, graduating with a 4.0. Well, there's nothing like that in careers, right? We think it's actually a non-linear experience and there's always something better than you at speaking or presenting or strategy or execution. But if you're always learning, learning from the best, getting feedback, you're always going to get better every single day.

(00:03:35):
And that's what I have always held, which is each job I took, I didn't necessarily qualify for it. I wasn't necessarily the very best at it, and so it became the student of being better at that job. And once I mastered that, I was a student for something else, something else and something else. And so I always balanced learning and impact, which was you can have the most impact, the job you know the best, but then you stop learning. And if you're learning all the time, you're not necessarily having impact.

(00:04:00):
So how do you keep going back and forth and back and forth so that you're not going straight up a lot or you're actually laddering back and forth into different things where you're having an amazing time where you know everything and then you're the newbie again and learning new things, and you're incorporating what you used to know into what you're learning and the impact that you have today and so on and so forth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:21):

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.

(00:06:31):
This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop in replacement for auth zero and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:07:03):
You talked about you got into a new job maybe you weren't ready for and you had to learn on the job. So either maybe share story one of those experiences or just like how do you actually do this? So someone's listening, they're like, how do I learn? What am I learning?

Deb Liu (00:07:14):
We'll start with my career in tech. So I had worked in consulting before business school. I went to Stanford for business school, came out to California, didn't know that much about tech, but I really loved using eBay. So I interned there my first year in business school and then when it came to finding a job, I really wasn't sure what we wanted to do, but we wanted to move back to the East Coast. And so I wasn't looking and I couldn't find a job. I think it was really hard. It was 2002. And so I ran into Tim Wenzel and Catherine Wu. So Catherine Wu was from Airbnb as you might know her. And Tim Wenzel put together the PayPal Mafia. He was the recruiter for PayPal.

(00:07:51):
Went to this table and I said, "Absolutely love PayPal, use it all the time. I'm a big seller on eBay," and he's like, "Do you want a job?" I'm like, "No, I'm actually going back east. "And he's like, "Just come in and talk to us." And so I said, "Okay. Well, what kind of jobs do you have?" And he's like, "I have jobs in product and I have jobs in marketing." Now, I've taken marketing class obviously in business school, and I said, "I wonder what this other product job is."

(00:08:12):
So I look over at Catherine and I've seen her around Stanford before, so she was a year ahead of me and I said, "Well, what do you do?" She said, "Product." I'm like, "That sounds good. I'll do that." And that's actually how I fell into product management. Well, I actually, and I'm embarrassed to say faked my way through those interviews, because during the interviews they're like, "Well, what would you build?" And since I was an avid user of both products, I could really richly say, "Here's the product feedback I have. Here are the new products you should build. Here's my feedback on things that we should be doing differently."

(00:08:39):
And they said, "Congratulations." And they gave me the job. And embarrassingly I went to the first day of work and I said to Amy Clement, who was the VP of product at the time, and I said, "Okay, I literally have no idea what this product job is."

(00:08:54):
She showed me the ropes and she was so incredible. She actually showed me, she said, "All those ideas you had, all that energy you've had around building these things, we go do that. Let's go do it." And I said, "Well, how do you do that?" And she said, "Well, you write down what you want to build and you work with the engineers to do it." And I just remember thinking, "This is crazy. I have no idea what I'm doing."

(00:09:14):
It was such an incredible adventure though. Those first few years, I just learned so much about the craft of building, how to really think through product use cases, how to think through what customers wanted, not just the customer of one, myself, but really what true customers and customer cohorts wanted. And so it was really a time when I felt like I was really blossoming, but I didn't come in with mastery. I came with a curiosity and I think that's what made me a great product manager was that I didn't have a set way of doing things. There wasn't some playbook I was trying to play. There wasn't some framework, but instead I was willing to learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
So one takeaway might be from this, the phrase, fake it till you make it. Any thoughts on just how to... I imagine many people right now are like, "Oh, I'm trying to get a job as a pm. How do I do this? That sounds great. I'm going to pass this interview, figure out the job after I joined."

Deb Liu (00:10:02):
Coming in with humbleness was really important, but during the interview process, actually, I didn't realize this, but they asked me questions as if I was a product manager, as if I knew what I was doing. I think when you have passion around a product or passion around a company or around a business model or around something, it shows. And so it's not necessarily faking the enthusiasm or faking the idea that you want to work there, but you don't have to know how to write this spec or PRD or briefings or anything like that. You don't know how to do customer research or do data analytics or read reports, but instead show your passion around the product itself, around the use case, around the customer.

(00:10:41):
Show who you are and why you care. I think sometimes people just say, "I want a product job." But you have to be able to fall in love with the problem. You have to fall in love, not with the product, but I said the problem, right? The use case. What problem are you trying to solve? And if you can do that, you can be a great product manager even without a lot of experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):
That's an awesome piece of advice. So just lean into the passion. First of all, part of it is you have to be excited about the thing you're trying to work on or thinking about the company you're thinking about joining. Sounds like that's a prerequisite here. We have a podcast episode with Uri Levine who has a whole book called Fall in Love with the Problem, which is all about that same idea actually for startup founders.

Deb Liu (00:11:20):
I'll have to read it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:20):
Yeah, he always wears a shirt, fall in love with the problem, not the solution.

Deb Liu (00:11:23):
Yes, is absolutely the most important skill for a product leader.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:27):
Something else I've heard you talk about in terms of something that contributed to your success is being okay with failure and just bouncing back quickly versus avoiding failure. Is that something that you can come back to a lot?

Deb Liu (00:11:40):
Well, here's what I noticed about everybody. I've coached a ton of people in my life. I have managed big teens and the people who are most successful are not the people who had no failures, who were lived charm lives, head up into the right careers and got promoted every cycle. The people who were most successful were the ones who actually through adversity, learned to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones. They were the ones who got hard feedback and then came back stronger because now they learned what to do differently.

(00:12:09):
They were the ones who products failed, but they said, "You know what? I'm going to turn this failure into success. I'm going to take those lessons and make this company stronger." When you live a charmed product life, you always work on everything that's easy. You don't actually... Trees are strong because they bend in the wind, because they're tested, because it's cold, because it's windy, because there's conditions.

(00:12:31):
And that's how a tree goes grow strong and tall over many generations. And I think sometimes we think, "Oh yeah, I wish I lived a charm life." And that is not what we want. You want to have enough adversity that you learn to overcome so that you can build stronger over time and build resilience in your career.

(00:12:50):
I've seen that so much, which is the best product leaders I ever worked with are the ones that have the toughest stories, that had the hardest feedback, but also the ones who were able to bounce back quickly and make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):
We have a segment on this podcast called Failure Corner where people share a failure they went through kind of along the same lines and something we learned from that experience. Is there an example of that from your career where a failure made you stronger?

Deb Liu (00:13:13):
Yeah. I remember there was a job that I really wanted at Facebook and I'd been there for a long time. I had been leading different teams. I was a VP of product and then GM. There was one job that I never got to do, so I got to do all the jobs I wanted and Mark gave it to someone else. I told him at the time when he gave it to the first person who was amazing at it, I said, "If this job were open, I'd like to be considered for it."

(00:13:37):
The job opened up later, gave it to someone else. And I said to Mark, again, "I really wanted that job." And he said, "Not only will I not give you that job, you'll never have that job at this company."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):
What?

Deb Liu (00:13:51):
He didn't say it harshly. But he was giving me feedback about something which he did not see me in that role, in a role that I really wanted. And I had to decide each time like, "What do I do with this information?" This is my dream job. Actually, I decided I was going to turn the job I had and the job I wanted, and that's a choice. I could have said, you know what? I can't have that job. I could go do something else, but I didn't. I took the job I had with the team I had and I turned it into this thing that was going to be something we wanted.

(00:14:20):
And so I think sometimes it's not... I think that that experience was a very humbling experience because to be told no and then to say that this will never happen was really hard. But at the same time it was a reminder that you're not right for every job even if you think you are. And that you can take the raw materials of what you have and turn it into what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):
Are you able to share what those jobs were that you wanted to get that you never got?

Deb Liu (00:14:44):
I never actually shared it publicly, but it's something which I had always had a role where I did new things for the company and there was a role where it was running something which more of an existing business, but I had always been kind of the innovator, the new stuff person. I had taken over so many new things. And so maybe that wasn't the right thing at the right time for me, but it was something that was really incredible and a turning point for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Great segue to an area I wanted to spend some time on which is building zero to one stuff within a larger company. So from what I can tell you built 2 billion businesses within a large company, Facebook marketplace, and then the ads platform within Facebook and maybe more. I don't know, the payments stuff, the games. I don't know. Maybe there's billions of dollars there I don't even know about. And this is very rare and very hard, and it's something we talk a little bit on this podcast, just the skills to build something new.

(00:15:38):
I know with marketplace it was not something people believed in for a long time. It took a lot of work to convince people to actually give it a shot. So I guess the question here is just what have you found are key tactics to start something new and allow it to continue to exist and get to a place where people start to believe it? What has worked for you?

Deb Liu (00:15:57):
So first, I didn't build the ads platform. I actually built the first direct response ad product company ever had. But we'll talk about how that led to why direct response is a vast majority of the ads revenue for the company. But one thing that it was really interesting is that I really saw my opportunity in Facebook to be somebody that zigged when other people zagged. There were amazing people who did a lot of the really core products working on feed, photos, videos.

(00:16:25):
I came in actually on the payments team and we worked on payments and eventually built games, which was the first billion dollar business. It was very successful. We worked with the likes of all the game companies that were on the Canvas games platform. And it was just an incredible opportunity to start from scratch and built something really cool. We built Facebook credits, which eventually became the Facebook payment system.

(00:16:47):
And then from there on I built the first direct response ads product. And again, leveraging the skills that we had, we had a lot of relationships with game companies because of my time and payments. And so we just said, "Hey look, what ad product do you want?" And they said, "Actually, your biggest challenge is the shift to mobile. Build us a mobile acquisition engine." And we said, "That's doable."

(00:17:09):
At the time the company was very brand oriented. Most of the ads... Actually almost all the ads on the platform were brand and we were not even on the ads team. So we actually worked on this team called the platform team. We said, "Okay, we'll build an ads product for the Facebook feed, the new mobile Facebook feed." And suddenly it became a billion dollar business within about 18 months, which was such an incredible journey.

(00:17:30):
We worked on the mobile advertising platform, so basically the mobile ads network. That was a great experience. And so each time I worked on something, it was just... The thing that you have to remember is the failure rate for something like this is very high. You start something and the amount of iteration... People think, "Oh yeah, it's easy." You start something and it's linear because you have all the resources of this company behind you. But actually everything in the company is like, "Let's do the most important thing."

(00:17:58):
These are seeds and we'll just let them... And so if you do that, you have to know that you don't get a lot of resources, you get a lot of attention. And I appreciated that because I think I work best when people aren't... There is not a lot of scrutiny. I think sometimes large companies, they say, "Well this innovation team," and then they check in on them way too much. They're like, "Week to week progress, where are you going? What's your strategy?" But so much as you know of building something new is the iteration process. It's the failing a lot.

(00:18:27):
We actually tested five or six versions of the ads product before we got it to take off and it took months, and then we were on the verge of death multiple times. In fact, I actually went back to run the payments team while I was working on that product because the team we had gathered still want to continue working on it, but I needed a second job back on the payments team because they asked me, "We don't think this thing is going to work. You should go run your old team again." And I thought, "Well, I will do both."

(00:18:52):
And so I did both for a while until it really took off. The thing that I think a lot of large companies don't realize is that you can love something to death. And so with every new product, I'd rather do it out of the limelight, do it with the minimal resources and have the freedom to fail because success and failure really is... In startups, failing fast is really important or succeeding fast.

(00:19:18):
It's the long slog that makes it really hard. In a company, you end up getting cut if you're the long slog product. And so being able to just say, "You know what? We're pruning this. We're doing the next thing, the next thing." And then having the time to iterate and grow is really critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
So as a leader trying to do this and create space for this, is there something you've learned about how to allow for, "Don't over scrutinize us, don't look at us too carefully. We don't want to be in the limelight. Don't put too many resources on this yet." Is it just like, "Hey, Mark. Here's what I think." I imagine it's not as easy as that. There's a lot of influence and that kind of work. Is there any tactics that you could share to create this sort of environment?

Deb Liu (00:19:59):
I think the most important part of the environment is really patience. And again, this is a portfolio strategy and I tell every PM who... I used to do a new hire PM class and I say, "Look, a lot of you are going to go into the core product and your job is to grow X by 3 to 5% every six months. Growing engagement or growing sessions or maybe growing video views or whatever your metric is, you're trying to grow something 5% and then you exceed expectations."

(00:20:27):
And I said, "And then a bunch of you are like, 'I want to do something new. I want to build something from scratch.'" And I said, "By the way, a very, very successful company for a new set of products has a 50% hit rate. So half of you are going to come back in a year and have a different job because that did not work out. Do you have the resilience to do that?" And I think somebody, you enter a large company... By the way, you can have an amazing career building core products because that is an incredible journey within... Because you learn so much about the mechanics of what that takes.

(00:20:59):
And yet at the same time, I found a lot of energy from doing something that someone hasn't done before. And so I really enjoyed the, "Hey, this thing could fail. Let's pivot. Let's try to figure out. Let's prune this. Let's try that." And not everything I did there succeeded, but a lot of the things that are the lasting products are once that gotten really big. And so for me it was a greater reward and it made a journey so much more interesting.

(00:21:24):
But for others, I think work on the core product, learn the skills. It is absolutely respectable as well. But if you choose to be the person who works on innovation new products, expect in a year, you might literally have nothing to show for it, but the lessons that you learned. And I think those lessons are really precious and we often underestimate that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):
Along those lines, do you think it's a good career move to do a zero to one thing within a bigger company? Or is it often a bad idea? Do you have any advice there for folks?

Deb Liu (00:21:52):
It depends. It depends on your personality in the company. So the one thing I realized about my role was that I did a lot of... I had five different careers at the company over 11 years. And so most people don't realize that when you work on new things, you're constantly adding to your portfolio, subtracting from it, growing things, pruning them. And so you could just work on so many cool things except everything has similar... It's like it rhymes, but it's not exactly the same.

(00:22:19):
So you learn the lessons of how to get things done, how to get resource, how to get support when the product is not working, how to not get prunes in the next culling. And those are really, really important skills. But I think for people who are just starting out of the career, it is a very high risk thing to do. So if you're very early in the career, I encourage people just learn the core skills first. You can learn the core skills when there's a lot of stability. This product is growing X percent, like 5%, and you're going to grow at 10. That's amazing.

(00:22:47):
That is because you are there, you're going to change your trajectory of the product, or this thing has a hundred thousand users, you're going to get it to 200,000. Those are the kinds of things that are going to be successful for you and you can put on your resume. But I think it reaches a point in your career where you have to decide, when am I going to take the big swing? Because the big swings are the things that you write your career stories about. They're not just, I moved this metric X, but I changed your trajectory in this way.

(00:23:17):
And so the big swings though have a lot of failures along the way. And so you have to understand you're making trade-offs in that. I encourage everybody to take some time, two, three years in their career when they're ready for the big swing, where if it doesn't work... If it works, you run the team, you run this amazing product. It doesn't work, you can always go back and go back to the core products.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:39):
It's interesting how your strategy here is very similar to a product portfolio strategy where as a team should have a few big bets and then a lot of incremental stuff. And it reminds me about this awesome post called You Are in Control of Your Career. And the argument in your post is you should PM your career the way you PM your product. So there's a lot of synergy here. So maybe just diving into this post and advice around this, how should someone be PMing their career, the way they PM a product? What's your take there?

Deb Liu (00:24:05):
By the way, for your PM audience, I want to say this, which is a lot of the greatest PMs are the worst PMs of their careers. They love products. They love the crafts. They love the customer research, the data. They have plans, they have timelines. And then when it comes to career, they have none of those things. They just drift from job to job. "Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what's in there? What are your milestones? What are the skills? What are the features that you want to have of your career? How are you going to get there? What does success look like?

(00:24:41):
You actually have metrics for your product, and yet you don't have metrics for your career. I coach a lot of people and when I coach them, I ask them, "Well, where do you want to see yourself in five years? Where do you want to go?" And half the people have no idea. I think that's really tragic because when you PM your career, it's about intentionality. But I'll tell you the story of my career and how I was the accidental PM and then eventually... I told you how I accidentally fell into PM, but also fell into so many of the things that happened in my PM career.

(00:25:10):
And if I had to go back, I would think much more deeply about what I want to accomplish. So I ended up at PayPal working for a guy named Dave Lee who reported to Amy Clement, and then he left. And so she offered me his role. I had only managed people for, I don't know, 15 seconds. I was two years out of business school and I was definitely not qualified to do his job. He was the director of product. I wasn't even a director and I was running the team for eBay.

(00:25:34):
So basically the PayPal part of eBay, which was basically half the company's revenues and profits. Totally unqualified. I ended up in this job and I do a good job. I ended up doing it for several years. I built up the team and we have a great relationship with eBay. Our team was very close and we were able to actually build something really lasting that worked really well. And then I had a baby. And so this happens in a lot of women's careers. I was turning 30, I had my son, and I had to leave for six months.

(00:26:08):
So I handed my product to my successor, Mike Woo and he ended up taking over. He did such a good job while I was gone, I didn't want to displace him when I got back. And so I thought, "Well, I'll go and look for another role." I couldn't really find a product role I liked, I mean, because there weren't that many product director roles. And so I ended up in corporate strategy. So I worked for the amazing Rajiv who was CEO at the time. He since passed and I wrote his speeches, worked on strategies, I worked on digital goods and charity, and ended up building that into a vertical for the company. So charity, social commerce and digital goods.

(00:26:40):
And I thought, "Okay, this is an interesting job." So I create the job, have a couple product managers, wasn't really sure where this was going, and then one day I was like, "You know what? I'm not feeling this. I have a child at home." I had gotten into what Cheryl Sandberg calls that kind of between kids situation where I was bored of my job.

(00:26:59):
I was working one of the VPs I worked with and I resigned. I said, "I'm leaving tech, just I'm going to stay home and maybe start something small." He convinced me to hold off and he said, I'll find you a job. He calls me a week later and he said, "Found you a job with Stephanie Tilenius leading the buyer experience at eBay product." And I said, "Oh, that sounds interesting." So I said, "Sure, as you notice, I do not have a plan. I'm just drifting. I'm so fortunate that I had amazing mentors who gave me opportunities, but end up working for Greg Fant and Stephanie Tilenius at eBay for two years.

(00:27:34):
I led the buyer experience. We did some really good work there. And then went on maternity leave again. And I get a call from a friend, my old engineering manager from PayPal, "Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? You can't come into product. You need a CS degree for that, but we have a product marketing job open." I was like, "Sounds good." Drop into Facebook. And so again, no idea what I'm doing back in product marketing. So I spent a few years doing that. Eventually was invited into product and so on and so forth.

(00:28:02):
And each job that came along was organic, but also kind of accidental. I see that happen in a lot of careers, which is my story when you look back, looks great. It looks like it all worked out, but I had almost zero intentionality in any of these. And I think that had I had more agency and I thought about what I wanted, I could actually measure is this the thing that would get me further or not?

(00:28:24):
I ended up extremely lucky, but not everybody does. And so I think having a plan allows you to compare every decision. It's not like when you're offered an admission to college, we're looking at three different offers maybe with financial aid or not, and you can make a decision, "Oh, they're offering me this department, but I can't get into this department." This is how far it is from home. But jobs and roles or nothing like that. Someone calls you one day, "Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? I'm actually on maternity leave." And he's like, "Just come talk to me." I'm like, "Why not."

(00:29:00):
And you end up dropping into different parts of your life and I think sometimes by saying, "Here's where I want to go and here's how I want to get there," you can have such a better career. And so I do encourage everybody to do this and to think about what does success look like in five years and how far am I from that and am I heading in the right direction?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:20):
What's interesting is I also had a similar path to you where I had zero plan or intention or goal and also just follow things and things worked out. I wonder how often that happens and I wonder if this idea of having intention and planning a roadmap is something you do if things aren't working out because maybe there's some good to not overthinking it and just following pull. I don't know.

Deb Liu (00:29:45):
Well, I think the problem is this with you and me, Lenny, is that hindsight bias is a problem. We made it because we weren't intentional in a lot of ways, but for how many people, is that true? For how many people who aren't... You don't have a plan and you get there. I always tell people, if you are sure what your destination is, that's definitely where you're going to end up. But if you actually aim in the right direction, you can shape your learnings, you can shape your roles you take, you can shape your skills towards the place that you want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:16):
When you talk about getting this offer from Facebook, usually those are like you have three days to decide.

Deb Liu (00:30:21):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):
And it feels like that's when the things you've done ahead of time of here's what I want would be most helpful.

Deb Liu (00:30:29):
Also, I think the thing about job opportunities in particular is they tend to come serially. It's only you presented these offers. It's like one role is so different from another and they often don't happen at the same time. They might say, "Well, you have to decide in two weeks." And then you say, "Well, there's this other company I'm talking to and you get a lot of pressure to say yes to this versus this."

(00:30:49):
And to really having a measuring stick is this getting me closer or further away from where I go? Can allow you to actually take serial decision making to a place where you're measuring against a long-term goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:01):
I did a meditation retreat once and when you're meditating, there's this kind of guidance of don't try too hard, don't push yourself to go into a direction, "Oh, I'm not doing a good job. I need to get to this enlightened state." And instead their advice is just push your cart in a direction and think about that's the direction you want head, but you don't need to grasp on to here's where I need to land, here's where I need to go. And I wonder if just having a thought of here's where I want my career to go. I want to be on boards in the future. I want to start a company in the future. I want to become a designer in the future. At least start there maybe just like a direction that you're heading.

Deb Liu (00:31:40):
Yeah. There's a woman who I worked with in product and now she's the founder, very successful founder, and she said to me, "I want to join the board of this Fortune 100 company." She told me the company, and I said, "Okay, that's a lot." So she said, "How can I get there?" And I said, "First, it's probably going to take you 10 years because look at who's on the board. I happen to know a couple people on the board." And I said, "Why don't I introduce you to one of them? And they can tell you how to get there.

(00:32:04):
But the point is she knew where she wanted to go and she said, "I'm willing to take it first step today." And I said, "First, you've never been on a board. You were very successful, but this is not... There's so many steps before you get there. It's like before you go to Harvard, you have to graduate from elementary school to middle school. You have to take the SAT, you have to apply. I said, "Let's start from the first step and let's break this problem down."

(00:32:29):
But I love that she knew where she wanted to go and she's like, "Even if I don't make it there, I'll be happier having made this journey." And I love that for her. And I think she's still earlier in her career, she has so much time ahead of her, but it's really incredible to see her kind of on this path and to know that that's her dream, and that I can help her a little bit along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
It also relates very much to your idea of thinking of your career like a PM thinks about their product where one of the tactics is to imagine the ideal scenario and work backwards from that versus incrementally what's the next thing? What's the next thing? So in this case, she was thinking, "Here's where I want to head. Okay, what's the next thing to get to that direction?" I love that.

(00:33:53):
Okay, going a slightly different direction, I'd say the post that you've written that has most resonated with me was about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert, and that basically have to learn to be an extrovert as an introvert because in business extroverts are most valued. Can you just talk about of your insight, what you've seen around this and how and your advice to introverts like me about how to be successful in business, what you need to change?

Deb Liu (00:34:22):
Well, first, I love the book, Quiet by Susan Cain. She talks about the power of introverts. Unfortunately, the world doesn't see the way the world the way she does. I wrote this post. It was the secret bias no one talks about, which is the workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. And I tell the story of somebody on my team who's just an amazing product manager, and yet every time she came up for promotion or calibration, people were like, "Oh, what does she do?" And it was because she was not good at broadcasting or explaining what she does.

(00:34:54):
I would take her to executive meetings and she was really bad at answering questions or talking. And so we would prep and prep and prep. I just knew her skills and I could see her every day moving the product forward. But for some reason people... Because your peers also have influence over people's ratings and their promotions, and I was constantly just trying to figure out how to get them to see her brilliance. I asked her once, I said, "I noticed that you never answer questions when we do these presentations." She's like, "Yeah, because I'm a processor. And by the time I process, I feel like the conversation has moved on."

(00:35:28):
And so I really feel like the world, it's not built for somebody like her who's a brilliant product leader, but people couldn't see it. And I realized that so much of what products and just general leadership is, is not just doing the work, but actually... It's not just having the product, it's having great product marketing to go with it. Let's call it that. Okay, so I've been in product and I've been product marketing. You make a light bulb, but you're selling light.

(00:35:53):
I really think about how that she was making amazing number of light bulbs. She was lighting up all the houses, but she was not marketing the light. And I think that was the thing that was really missing. Is that fair? Absolutely not. There are a lot of people who are born introverted. Is it fair that a product manager who isn't introverted, isn't extroverted is struggling with that? No, but that's the world we live in. And so it's one of those things where you get to choose what you do.

(00:36:21):
First, I think for the individual is realizing that you are your own best marketer. You have to actually share what you do. If a great product is out in the world, but no one is told about it, did it exist? And so one of the things that's very important is really to get that product marketing.

(00:36:39):
The second part is we should change our workplaces so everyone can be successful. And I think that that's a really important skill. As more introverts get into leadership, they need to actually change the world to make more space for people like them as well. So one of the things that I found was in my leadership teams over the last several years, we had this thing where we all vote, but we vote offline in a document and we put a number in and then we put our comments in.

(00:37:05):
And that way everyone has an equal voice in this document. And then when we talk about it, usually, of course the extroverts speak first, but everyone has a vote and we can actually see what people's point of views are. And I love that. I love that when there's something we used to do at Facebook is we used to go around in a circle and everybody would give their opinion in a meeting. I do that still today. I ask every single person as a business leader at this company, would you do this?

(00:37:30):
And even I joke with our chief legal officer, Greg, I say, "You are a business leader and the lawyer. You can't just say, well, legal advises X." I'm like, "But what would you do?" And so nobody can take a backseat to decision making. Everybody has a voice. So there's so many of these kind of bias interrupters, things that we can do to actually make the world easier for those who weren't speaking up and taking 80% of the air in the room. And I do think that we have to craft a workplace where everyone can be their best.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:59):
In the post, you also talk about as much as we want to change the way people run their companies and think. I love your advice of you also still have to learn how to speak up and act more extroverted even though it's not natural to you. Is that right?

Deb Liu (00:38:14):
I think we do a disservice when we say we're not good at speaking up because it's a skill like any other. And if I told you the difference between your product being successful and not being successful is you giving this presentation, they're going to kill your product if you don't sell this to the executives. You would figure out a way to stand in front of those executives and defend the freaking heck out of your product. But why aren't you doing that every day?

(00:38:35):
And I think sometimes we forget that not everything is as essential as they're going to cut your product if you can't convince them to keep it. But every day you're actually building credibility for your team, getting more resources, getting more people to talk about your product inside your company, getting more press for the product outside. All of those things combined into momentum for your product. And don't you want the best thing for your product and your customers?

(00:38:58):
So if you think about it that way, it's not, well, I'm uncomfortable. I hear this a lot where people say, "Well, you wouldn't understand. I'm an introvert." And I'm like, "So was I." But instead I just said, "Okay, this is a necessary skill and it's a learnable skill. You don't have to be comfortable with it. You don't have to love it, but you just have to do it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:19):
What about from another perspective of why people don't do this, which is it feels like self-promotion and it feels like icky like, "I'm just sitting around promoting myself. I don't want to be doing that." Anything there that helps people get over that piece?

Deb Liu (00:39:31):
Well, I just remember I was talking to this ERG group and I was asking about... There was an upcoming calibration and self reviews were due in a couple of days. And I said, "Well, what are you doing for your self-review?" And somebody raised their hand and said, "Well, I'm really bad at self-promotion. What advice would you have for me?" And I said, "If you think your self-review is self-promotion, you're just not going to do a great job at it."

(00:39:56):
What if I called it educating your manager about all the great work your team has been doing? What if I called it helping people see why your team should get more resources? Suddenly you're cracking open, you're changing the question right from, "Oh, I was self-promoting to actually I'm helping my team get more resources and support." And suddenly she was like, "Oh yeah, I never thought about it that way."

(00:40:22):
But I think often if you frame it one way, it looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because of self-promotion. But at the same time, if it's education, what if I said, "I was talking to a PM who's really incredible. I've mentored him and sponsored him for a long time." And I said, "I don't understand why you don't have more of a voice. You've learned so much about the craft. You've done this at multiple companies." And he said exactly what you said which is I'm not really self-promoting.

(00:40:46):
And I said, "If you see it as self-promoting, you will never do it." And so let's talk about why you don't actually do this. And he said, "I've seen a lot of people who are really great on LinkedIn write these articles, but they have nothing to back it up." And I don't want to be like them. And I said, "Okay. Well, you read my blog, you follow me on LinkedIn, do you think I have nothing to black back it up?" And he's like, "No, of course not."

(00:41:07):
And I said, "Well, then why do you put yourself in his category instead of mine?" And I think it was just a moment where we just came to an understanding where he in his mind was like, "I don't want to be that person. It's an empty vessel that has no substance behind it." And I said, "Do you think the things I write have no substance?" But it was an interesting conversation because he had taken this mantle that it was self-promotion and that behind what if people think I'm nothing behind it?"

(00:41:32):
I'm like, "I know you have something behind this. I have been your manager. I have worked with you for many years, but you see how just reframing it has really changed his way of thinking about it." Still working on him. But I actually think he has so much to give and I think he has learned so much about the craft, and I wish that more product managers feel comfortable that they have something to give to the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):
I think what you're saying right now will resonate with a lot of people when they see people posting. I feel the still of just like, "I don't want to be this guy that's just posting nonsense on LinkedIn just to get likes," even though it's kind of what I do now full time. Hopefully it's not nonsense.

Deb Liu (00:42:08):
But it is all substance. So, Lenny, we know the substance behind it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
I tried, but I think there's posting on LinkedIn, posting on Twitter. There's like an innate just doing this because I want to get attention when often... And the way I started this is just like things I've learned that I think are useful, I'm just going to put them out there. So just to double click a little bit, I think this is a really powerful point. What actually have you found helps people get over that? Is it someone like you and his corner being like, "You have really great stuff to share, you should actually do it. Don't be as worried as you are, as you think you might be." Is there anything else that works there?

Deb Liu (00:42:41):
Actually what worked for me was I was working with Bos and I talk about our relationship in my book, but we made a contract when I started reporting to him. And Bos, for those of you don't know, is currently the CTO of Meta. At the time he was the head of ads and then our team moved into his team. And so I was reorged into his organization. And as I said we did not have the best relationship before that. And so we made a contract to work together and I had written like, "Here's how I want you to take care of my team. Here's how I want you to support our products." And I wrote them this long, my part of the commitment.

(00:43:13):
Then he wrote back, "Here's what I'm asking of you. I want you to write and publish something every month." I was like, "What are you talking about? Why would you say that?" He said, "You have so much to teach people. Just do it." I said, "I don't really have that much to say." And he's like, "Just trust me on this. You'll figure it out." His advice was write what you repeat. If you say something more than once, just write it down. And then the next time someone asks you, you can just hand them.

(00:43:40):
He has a great blog if you have read it. I just normally thinking that is a weird thing for your new manager to say after you had a lot of conflict together before that. But he took my contract, which was... By the way, he's like, "Oh, do you want to codify this in some way?" I'm like, "No, I just..." But every month from then on, I would literally just write something and it was my promise to him. And I did it faithfully and I published it internally. So I didn't publish it externally for a long time.

(00:44:04):
And then sometimes they would ask me if I want to publish it externally for the company and I would say yes. And so I did it for years. I reported to him for years. And then we switched managers. He moved over to Reality Labs and then I had a new manager and I continued and I continued this. Then I started doing a publicly, and then obviously I wrote a book. Because of him and his encouragement, it got me to a totally different place. And part of it was just the commitment. I now had accountability because I knew he was watching. I'm not actually sure if he was actually watching every month. But I felt the accountability to do this and I've done it every single month since.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):
So it's interesting that that's another example of your manager giving you the space slash forcing you to share publicly being a really good lever to get someone over this fear.

Deb Liu (00:44:48):
I think sometimes just doing it gets you over the hump. For example, my friend, Ami Vora. She writes an incredible blog. You have not read her Substack, you should. But she's an incredible writer. She'd write all these things internally and I said, "You should publish this externally." Now she does that and it's really great. And I think part of it was just seeing her just put it out there because she is one of the wisest career coaches that I have and managers that I have ever worked with. And so I'm like, "You have so much to say and to share."

(00:45:16):
So to see it out there, I feel like for years we all got the benefit of it because we knew her. But the world was not getting the benefit. So in some ways just having accountability. So we created a little accountability group to help each other write, and it was just a reminder, "Hey, did you do it?" And so I think it's sometimes what's necessary to get over that hump is either having someone forcing you, like your manager who you made a commitment to, or just having a friend to say, "Hey, by the way, where's this month's post?"

(00:45:41):
Those things matter because now you got over the hump of, "I have to do it." And now it's just about how good you're going to make it and how much time you're going to put into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):
Awesome advice. And by the way, folks don't know we've had both Bos and Ami on the podcast in the past.

Deb Liu (00:45:55):
Aren't they both amazing?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):
Amazing. And Ami's episode is one of the most popular episodes. More popular than Bos, CTO of Meta.

Deb Liu (00:45:56):
I know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):
Who would've thought?

Deb Liu (00:46:06):
She has a lot of coaching wisdom I think that everyone should hear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):
Yeah, she's amazing. She has a great Substack. We'll link to it again in the show notes. We'll link to your Substack as well.

Deb Liu (00:46:13):
Yeah, please do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):
Go Substack. I want to move in a slightly different direction. Talk about growth for a little bit. You have a really nice perspective on how to think about growth. I think a lot of people think of growth as like, "Here's a magic bullet. We're going to do this thing. It's going to go, "Wow, we're going to win." And your approach is, you talk about it, it's a game of inches. Growth is a game of inches. Can you talk about your perspective there?

Deb Liu (00:46:34):
Yeah. Sometimes we think it's like what is the huge step function? But actually most companies are like... We call it points of growth, right? It's like if you can move things 1% a little bit faster every single week, think about the amount of growth you get at the end. And so it's not just, "Okay, what's going to get you the 3X? You can get to 3X 1% at a time, 5% at a time. Single digit growth. And sometimes it is the small things that matter the most. And so we think about product-led growth, it's really about finding the aha moments, the opportunities. And sometimes opportunities are things that seem really silly.

(00:47:10):
I heard the story at Facebook that one of the big things was just adding the, next to ads, they put the word create an ad, was one of the biggest growth drivers. And that was it just putting a link because people just didn't know how to get to the ads flow. It was things like that where you can actually bend the curve of choices that you make. Same thing, each of the growth teams I've ever worked on, it's like really the small things adding up. It is a list we used to work on payments growth and we had a list of a hundred things we were working on hypotheses.

(00:47:42):
And then we would pick and we would grow them by picking the first 10 and we would start working on them, the next 10, the next 10, and we would go through these sprint cycles. And the same thing when we were growing the ads product as well. Marketplace, each of them were just like, "What are the small things that add up to big things?" And I think sometimes we overthink it.

(00:48:00):
Instead, you probably have a hundred ideas. And by the way, it is absolutely okay if the 80% of them don't work. I tell people sometimes we overthink as product manager if we just had the perfect plan, the perfect battle plan, but instead imagine you're a team and you can ship, I don't know, let's say four things. But what if you're a team that can ship 20 things with the same with a 20% success. You get just as much output and yet you know what doesn't work also.

(00:48:30):
What if you can move it from 20% to 30%? Suddenly six things work, not just four things. And so in the same amount of time you have all the lessons of what didn't work, plus you're getting 50% more output. And so you thinking about growth as this engine of, it's a learning machine of what doesn't work, what you reiterate on, what you change, and you're constantly getting better and better and better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:50):
I think what you're saying will resonate with a lot of product people where there's always this like, "We're just doing a bunch of optimization, incremental work. Still sucks, boring. Let's take some big bets." And in my experience, and sounds like in your experience, a lot of the wins actually... And Facebook is famous for this, just relentlessly looking for ways to grow, optimize, optimize, optimize because that's where a lot of growth comes from.

(00:49:14):
At the same time, obviously you need to take some big bets and take some swings and look for step function changes. But I guess for someone that's just like... I don't know. Is there any advice on just creating that culture of like, "It's okay to optimize for a long time, there's a lot of opportunity optimizing"? Is there anything you've learned there or is it just bringing in a Deb and it has to be a top down?

Deb Liu (00:49:32):
I treat growth like, let's say, a product marketing team. It is an augmentation for a product that works. So if you have a core product that works, you have a team that's working on... So for us at Ancestry, it's like search and hints of the core. What is the mechanics? You want people to add people to their family tree. You want them to add stories, okay? There's teams that make sure that the uptime is good, that the hints are working, the search delivers results.

(00:49:57):
And you need those teams, you need those core teams kind of functioning. But growth is actually optimization on top. It is making it so that you get to the search flow faster. The hints are surfacing better, that people are accepting them, that if we put the button here versus here, that people are going to discover things faster. And so it's really taking the core engine and actually wrapping it around the user interface around the experience, around the flows so that people can get to it faster, they can have more satisfaction, they can have more impact. And that's what I see growth as. It's not the core product. It is the cherry on top, making that product more accessible and more usable and better every single day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
Along these lines, I think it surprised people to learn. There's at least a hundred people at our Airbnb just working on pricing, optimizing pricing recommendations. There's endless opportunity to just make all these core components of an experience better and better and better over time. Okay. Last thing I want to talk about, and this is completely unrelated to everything we've been talking about mostly, which is your 30, 60, 90-day plan.

(00:51:00):
So you wrote this post a while ago, just like, here's a great 30, 60, 90-day plan when you join a company. I've heard that many people use this. It's really effective for helping someone onboard and be successful. And I think it's mostly for execs or is this for just anyone joining a company?

Deb Liu (00:51:16):
It's for anyone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:17):
Okay, anyone.

Deb Liu (00:51:18):
I created, it's actually when I joined Ancestry because I hadn't started a real new job in 11 years. And I thought, I'm going to be a student of how to land well. So I read a bunch of things, I read and I decided I was going to adapt all of those things into a summary and then I was going to try it real time in my blog.

(00:51:38):
So in my blog I write, "Here's what I'm going to do," and then I tell you what I did and how it worked and some things. And then I actually do a look back as to all the mistakes I made. And so I did this live. It was not planned quite as well as I would thought, but I put it together and I wrote the 30, 60, 90-day plan and I have a template. I always tell people it's focused on listening and learning first and then doing. So that's the crux of it, which is in those 90-days it's like you got to get used to the environment. You want to have some impact at the start. You want to have a couple quick wins, but you want to understand the lay of the land and you want to listen because you have something to contribute.

(00:52:19):
But if you don't understand the language, you don't understand the culture, you might actually make huge mistakes. And so for the first 30 days, I did a listening tour. I talked to over 60 people in 30 days and then I summarized a state of the union. Here's what I'm hearing, here are the challenges people feel like we're facing. Here's what people's wishlists are. And by the way, one person sent me a wishlist of five things and at that year, I think it took me till year two to finish his five things. And then I sent him a note. I said, "By the way, the first time we met, these five things you wanted to see, we just finished the last one."

(00:52:50):
And he's like, "I can't believe you remember." I took extensive notes and I summarized it. I think it's important because people want to hear that you hear them. And you don't have to be a manager or CEO to do that. I think people on teams often feel like there's no outlet for the things that they want to say. I encourage, especially product leaders, especially if you're joining an existing team, to listen really behind what people are saying and then offer to help them do one thing.

(00:53:17):
So especially when you're meeting with a new engineering team for the first time, actually ask them, what is one thing I can do to help you this week? I always say one thing, it's limited. This week, so getting 15 new headcount. Probably not going to happen. And it's like, how can I give back? And suddenly you're building a reciprocal relationship. And so a lot of this 30, 60, 90-day plan is really to help you find your footing and then to start having impact immediately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):
Say you join a company and you're like, "I'm going to do 30 days listening," and then your boss is like, "No, we need to ship stuff. Get on it, ship this stuff." Is there any advice for trying to push back on that, create space for listening when there's deadlines, things aren't [inaudible 00:53:56]?

Deb Liu (00:53:57):
I encourage everybody to get on the same page on this 30, 60, 90-day plan with their manager. So actually don't just keep it to yourself. Share it with as many people as you can. So I think it's very important that everyone sees what you're trying to accomplish and what your output is going to be. Because if you don't know the output, is success there? The second part is with your manager say, "Okay. I would like to carve 20% of my time listening and I'm happy to do this work 80% of the time." Therefore every morning from nine to 10, I want to talk to somebody in the organization.

(00:54:28):
Just make sure you say, "I will do a better job and have more impact if I have this time to make sure that I'm not accidentally making mistake or I don't get a chance, I'm asking something of somebody, but I've never met them." And to really carve out space because it's really important. Once you're in it, people give you the new person card for maybe a month or two and then suddenly it's all the problems are your problems.

(00:54:53):
But what if you don't know what the problems are? And so I always say diagnose before you treat. So make sure you understand so that you can help and deliver what your manager is actually expecting of you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):
I'm looking at your template. So just to share the bucket. So first 30 days learning focus, second 30 days is aligning on vision for the future, and the last 30 days of the 90 days is executing, setting up, actually starting to get stuff done. Awesome. Anything else along these lines of this?

Deb Liu (00:55:23):
The one thing about having a plan also is that you don't feel rushed to do something that you're not ready for because I do think sometimes you feel like you need to have impact. I always tell people, "Do something small, give back in some ways that people see you making." But when you actually reflect, one of the biggest things I could do was actually reflect back to the organization, "Here's what I heard from all of you. I'm listening, I hear this and here's what I want to do about it."

(00:55:53):
And then in aligning it's like, "Do we agree this is a set of problems we want to tackle?" And then an execution is like, "Do we agree that this is how we want to move forward?" And I think that is such an important part of building into a team. When you enter an organization, you're also entering a team and you're part of a dance that's going around. What role do you play? And people are dancing around you and if you actually make a mistake, you could trip other people up as well. So really finding your place in the dance is really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:21):
And as a PM, the way I always think about is people won't assume they should trust you. You're just this person that's coming in to tell them what to do and so much of your first month, two, three is building that trust with people so that they can actually feel comfortable listening to your guidance and not just like, "Oh my god. This person is getting in my way."

Deb Liu (00:56:40):
And earning that trust, sometimes people really... You'd be really surprised, a lot of people feel like they're not heard and even just coming in and listening is a trust building exercise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):
Such a good point. As we wrap up our conversation, just a couple more questions here. So first is I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, which is a segment on this podcast. And my question is there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe? Something that you think is a contrarian perspective?

Deb Liu (00:57:10):
I don't know if this is a contrarian perspective, but I go to speak in a lot of universities. So I speak at Stanford and I'm going to speak at Duke. And I always tell people, especially young people, the most important career decision you make is who you marry. And it's not something we think that much about, especially I started dating... I met my husband when I was 18, my first weekend in college. Started dating when I was 19. We had no idea what our life was going to be like and yet every single day like this week we had our board meeting, I was in Utah the whole week. I come home and he's taking care of everything.

(00:57:43):
You will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang. If something is out of balance, it engulfs the other side. Both your job and your home life. And especially, we have three kids. Really balancing that is very hard over both of us having demanding careers. It's not something that's contrarian, but it's something which we don't think about at all when we make that decision. We think is this person fun to be with? Is this person somebody we see ourselves with? But my question is what is the impact of this relationship on your career?

(00:58:14):
Is this person lifting you up or pushing you back? Is this person someone who's going to be your greatest cheerleader or are they going to be the greatest weight on you? How do you think that that's going to manifest itself 20 years, 30 years from now? And I think it's just something I wish we thought about more and I encourage especially young people to think about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):
Such a great point. What I want now is a guide for vetting these things when you're dating. Deb's guide to dating.

Deb Liu (00:58:44):
I need to write that. Although I've only really dated him, the one person, so maybe I am like the worst person to tell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):
But it worked, so you're maybe the best person and now you look back.

Deb Liu (00:58:49):
That's right. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:53):
And here's the questions I asked that worked. That's so funny. Okay, so before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think might be helpful to share, something you might want to leave listeners with? Any other nuggets of wisdom or advice?

Deb Liu (00:59:08):
Well, there's one quote which I share, I thought about when you were speaking earlier, which is about people who are resilient, which is life... This is a quote from Chuck Swindoll, he's a Christian writer I used to read a lot and it was, "Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it." And I just looked him up recently and he actually published a book with that quote. He actually had that quote in a previous book from 20 years ago.

(00:59:34):
And I just think that's so important. You don't get to choose everything that happens in your life. So much is just, it just happens, but it's the people who choose a way forward to turn stumbling blocks and the stepping stones. As I said, "Somebody who actually says, 'you know what? I didn't get the job that I wanted and I'm just going to figure out another path,' those are the people who have the most successful and satisfying careers." They're thinking when other people are zagging vice versa. And I think that there are the ones who are the most resilient and happy in the long term.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):
It's such a good circle back to one of your first pieces of advice of just most successful people are people that are resilient and don't avoid failure, but embrace it and find a way to turn that around. I think it's such an important point. It's so hard to do. I guess just, I don't know, just to follow this thread a little bit, is there anything that has helped you build that? Has that always been the way your mind worked? I imagine coaching helps this, helps people with this." Is there anything just like that?

Deb Liu (01:00:29):
Coaching is incredible for that. We joke it's work therapy, but really I think it's... For a long time I saw failure as this catastrophic thing. I was one of those kids who's like, "You never got a B until..." Then I got to college and I was like, "Wow, this is harder than I thought." And so I got two B's in college and I'm like, "I'm never doing that again." But I was that kid who always got the A, who got the great scores. I just thought that my life would end if I got a B which by the way is super unhealthy.

(01:01:00):
And looking back, I realized that work is not like that at all. And every time I got bad feedback I'm like, "This is catastrophic." But if you look at feedback as an opportunity, then it's very different. It's like this is a gift. I would be crushed. Every time I get a review no matter what rating I got, I would read the things that people would say and I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm a terrible person." And I had to really rethink that. And I think coaching, leadership coaching has really helped me through that to say, "No, how do you process this and how do you get to the other side?"

(01:01:33):
And that has been so transformative for me is to have that outlet to actually talk through. No, no, no. What they're saying is not that you're a bad product person, it's that you need to do a better job communicating or connecting. And I really struggled with that. I was very transactional. I was not a connector. I was not warm. I really struggled with relationships. And a lot of the feedback I received for many years is this relationship issue. And it took me a long time to realize that people aren't saying this because I'm a bad person or that they hate me, but because they want to connect.

(01:02:03):
I was actually making it hard. And I think sometimes we take things so personally that it becomes kind of this thing. It is your white whale. It's like the thing you're chasing, but then what if you say, "You know what, I don't need to do that. I don't need to chase that. Instead I need to figure out what's behind the feedback and what are they trying to say?" And then actually change yourself over a long period of time towards that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:26):
I had similar challenges where I had this pretty real imposter syndrome for a while when I started doing well. And a coach was the key for me to help me get over that and see that if I made a mistake. Things wouldn't crumble. And that it's very normal to make mistakes. Nobody will-

Deb Liu (01:02:43):
And by the way, I think perfectionism is a curse we place on ourselves. And it's a very dangerous thing, particularly for product leaders because product managers, you know things are going to go wrong. That's literally part of your job. And yet when we have perfectionism, it is a lack of trust in our ability to bounce back and our ability to actually adapt. But the more adaptable you are, the less you have to be perfect every single time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:09):
Just to leave people with a tactical piece of advice, say they are like, "Oh man, I need a coach," do you have any advice for how to find a coach? How to explore that route?

Deb Liu (01:03:17):
So I actually wrote an article, because one of the things I struggle with coaching is very expensive often, and not every company provides it. My husband actually works at a coaching company called Sounding Board to make it more accessible. But one of the things I encourage people to do is there are other ways to get coaches. I'm in a lean-in group and we are just like, we support each other. I'm in a coaching circle in YPO, so that's a group of CEOs. And I'm in a number of these coaching circles, which give you an opportunity to learn from each other and to get pure coaching. And I think that's a great place to start, especially early in your career when you're seeing the same people making the same mistakes.

(01:03:54):
I think as you get more senior, having an individual coach helps because the situations are so much more unique. But I do think that having that outlet, having a place to say, "Hey, is it me or is this situation not right? And how should I think through this?" That's so incredibly important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:10):
I'm listening to this book, or reading a book called Listen right now that a previous guest recommended. It's a parenting book and it's about just the power of listening and how much that solves many problems with your challenges or with your child. When your child is having a problem just listening to them. There's a lot of power. This came from a coach that was on the podcast recently. [inaudible 01:04:31]

Deb Liu (01:04:30):
Sounds great. I'll definitely, I'll read it or listen to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):
I know it's weird. I'm like reading, it's called Listen. He's like, "This is the only parenting book you need really. It solves all the problems that we deal with." So anyway, that was an awesome final nugget that I'm glad we got there. With that though, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Deb Liu (01:04:52):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:53):
Let's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?

Deb Liu (01:04:59):
So I love the book from Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer. I speak in his class now that I read it way before that, it's called Power: Who Has It and Why. I love the book. He actually has the more practical one, 7 Rules of Power, which came out more recently. And so it's a book that reminds us that power is not accidental, that people often get it for different reasons and how you should think about the playing field.

(01:05:23):
Another book is The Conversation, Dr. Livingston wrote that about race in America, and I just love that it's a very honest assessment of race in America. It's hard to have that conversation and I love that he uses a lot of facts and encourages people to open up and have conversations around it. And then the last one I would say is, well, Susan Cain's Quiet. I adore the book because I do have introverted kids. I myself am introverted and just to read the power of introverts as a reminder that we do have amazing people who don't communicate the same way.

(01:05:59):
I love that it's a tribute to the success of those. Even if our workplace is not adapted to it, I do think we need to adapt to it so that we can bring the best in everybody. But her book is a reminder that there's so much power even in silence.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):
The first book you mentioned Jeffrey Pfeffer, he's been on the podcast. I think he may have mentioned you in our conversation or-

Deb Liu (01:06:17):
I love Professor Pfeffer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:19):
That was a fun conversation because I came into it very nervous for what his advice would be and then came up with it being like, "This is great. This is-"

Deb Liu (01:06:28):
He is very wise,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):
He's very wise and just very, "I don't care what you think, I'm just going to tell you the reality of the world." Oh man. Okay. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Deb Liu (01:06:41):
Okay. I know this is a fandom thing, but I love Fallout. So I played the game Fallout 4 last year, and then the show came out and it was amazing. And I know that sounds so nerdy, but it was incredible. And I know that video game movie annotations tend to be terrible, but it was so great and having played the game it was even better. Is that super nerdy?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):
No, I watched Fallout. I don't know anything about the game, but the show itself was really fun. Just I had no idea what I was even getting into. So no. Acceptable nerdy level. I don't know if you can get too nerdy on this show. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you just really like?

Deb Liu (01:07:26):
Well, so actually what's really interesting is I never got into Twitter. I just couldn't figure it out. Recently I really got into Threads and I didn't think I would. I was like, "Well, just post some stuff on it," but really I just love... I could never figure out Twitter. You follow the wrong person and the whole thing, it's terrible. If somebody is posting too much or too little, but there's something about the Threads algorithm that's really worked. The first few months wasn't quite there, but I just feel like it's spot on and now I see the magic of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:59):
That's so interesting. I've seen some stats that it's bigger than X now slash Twitter and I wonder if that's true. I got to look that up, but I've seen more activity on Threads. So maybe I need to go back there. I spent some time around-

Deb Liu (01:08:10):
Cheering from the sidelines that it's successful because I use it a lot now. And I guess I had never had a place for realtime news and it's not exactly meant to be newsy, but maybe it's just who I follow, but I love just seeing like, "Here's five headlines you probably missed." And I was like, "Oh." I know they're trying to downplay politics, but I just love that it feels like you get a glimpse of what's going on in the world in five minutes."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):
Okay. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family find useful in work or in life?

Deb Liu (01:08:42):
Ooh, that's a good question. Well, actually, I would say that it's very similar to the Chuck Swindoll one about life. So we can use that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
Great. That's what I imagined because you shared that one early on. And I imagine that was going to be your answer. Final question, you started Facebook Marketplace, you built it. Now, it has a billion users, more than that. What's the most interesting thing that you have bought or sold on Facebook Marketplace?

Deb Liu (01:09:07):
The best thing I ever sold on there was I sold my minivan on it and in four days. I made my husband do it because I wanted him to test the product. We were selling our minivan and I'm like, "Just try Facebook Marketplace." He's like, "I don't know about this." And he's like, "There's too many people contacting me. I needed it to stop." So it worked really well for us. I think I have bought so many things on there. It's actually sort of embarrassing.

(01:09:30):
Recently, my daughter wanted the same desk as I had for her new room and they no longer sell it at Costco. And I found it for half the price from a woman who was moving and she's like, "Here," and I love it. So I bought probably way too many things on Facebook Marketplace actually. But it's a great thing. I actually use it as a great rental for kid stuff because you buy a kid's bike and then when they outgrow it, you sell it back.

(01:09:56):
And the rental fee is almost free and I don't have the store all of it. So I love every part of it. I still am an admin user and I send a lot of feedback back to that team still.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:06):
That's amazing. Deb, this was amazing. I'm so happy we made time for this. Thank you so much for coming on. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe read about stuff you're doing? Where's your Substack and anything else people can check out?

Deb Liu (01:10:18):
Yeah, so debliu.substack if you want to look. I post probably about once a week. I'm on LinkedIn, I'm on Threads, so please do find me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:27):
And then the actual final question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Deb Liu (01:10:33):
Well, I would just love to hear what you heard from today that resonated with you and what you're going to do with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:37):
And how would they share that LinkedIn or at Threads?

Deb Liu (01:10:41):
I'm happy to read your comments or send it if you want to-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:41):
There we go.

Deb Liu (01:10:43):
... send it to me. If you've actually subscribed to my Substack, you can just reply to the first email and then I get it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):

# How Block is becoming the most AI-native enterprise in the world | Dhanji R. Prasanna

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
There's a lot of talk about productivity gains through AI. There's this camp of people that are so overhyped, nothing's working, nobody's actually adopting this at scale.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:00:07):
We see a significant amount of games. We find engineering teams that are very, very AI forward are reporting about eight to 10 hours save per week. Whenever I hear a stat like this, I think an important element is this is the worst it will ever be. This is now the baseline. The truth is the value is changing every day, so you need to ride that wave along with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
There's a story I heard you share on a different podcast where there's an engineer who has Goose watching.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:00:31):
You'll be talking to a colleague on Slack or an email, and they'll be discussing some feature that they think is useful to implement. Now a few hours later, he'll find that Goose has already tried to build that feature and opened a PR for it on Git.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
What level of engineer is most benefiting from these tools?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:00:47):
What's been surprising and really amazing, the non-technical people using AI agents and programming tools to build things, the people that are able to embrace it to optimize for their particular workday and their particular set of tasks are really showing the most impact from these tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
How do you think things will look in a couple of years in terms of how engineers work that's different from today?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:01:12):
All these LLMs are sitting idle overnight and on weekends, while humans aren't there. There's no need for that. They should be working all the time. They should be trying to build in anticipation of what we want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):
What's maybe the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or building teams?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:01:29):
A lot of engineers think that code quality is important to building a successful product. The two have nothing to do with each other.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:37):
Today my guest is Dhanji Prasanna. Dhanji is Chief Technology Officer at Block, where he oversees a team of over 3,500 people. With Dhanji's leadership, Block has become one of the most AI-native large companies in the world and has basically achieved what many eng and product leaders are trying to achieve within their companies.

(00:01:55):
In our conversation, we chat about their internal open source agent called Goose, that by their measure is saving employees on average eight to 10 hours a week of work time, and that number is going up, how AI specifically making their teams more productive and the teams that are benefiting most. Interestingly, it's not the engineering team, what it took to shift the culture to be very AI-oriented, the very boring change they made internally that boosted productivity even more than any AI tool.

(00:02:24):
Also, lessons from building Google Wave and Google Plus and Cash app and so much more. This episode is for anyone curious to see what a highly AI-forward technology-driven large company looks like and can act like.

(00:03:12):
This episode is brought to you by Sinch the Customer Communications Cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably, that's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email and calling into their products.

(00:03:38):
And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about. Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience, plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies, and here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS.

(00:04:06):
Sinch is already helping major bands send RCS messages around the world and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market. Learn more and get started at sinch.com/lenny. That's S-I-N-C-H .com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Figma, makers of Figma Make. When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team.

(00:04:35):
Suddenly, I could involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly, and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun. But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers.

(00:05:02):
Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool, because it's all in Figma. You can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision and instead show it to them. Make code back prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny. Dhanji, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:05:34):
Thank you Lenny. It's a great pleasure to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):
I want to start with a letter that I hear you wrote to Jack Dorsey to convince him that he and that Block needed to take AI a lot more seriously. I think you called it your AI manifesto and it seems like it really worked. We're going to talk a lot about the changes that came as a result of that. So let me just ask, what did you say in this letter and what happened right after you sent that letter to him?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:06:00):
So about two and a half years ago or so, Jack really felt like things needed to change. I think he had a sense that the industry was going in a different direction. So he got about 40 of the company's top executives into a room on a weekly basis, and they all used to sort of talk everything through that was going on and he added me to that group.

(00:06:26):
So at some point, I observed that we were talking about lots of deep things, lots of relevant things, but no one was really paying attention to AI, and so that's when I wrote that letter. And to be honest, it's I think taken on a life of its own, but there wasn't much to the letter other than I think we should do this. I think we should do it centrally and it's important for us to be ahead of the game and be an AI native company because that's where the industry is heading.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):
Let me just say it's important to note you were not CTO at this point. You were just a senior engineer kind of person?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:07:00):
No, yeah, in fact, I was part-time at the time because I had just had a kid and I was coming back in and I was helping out one of the engineering teams and then Jack came over to Sydney and spent two days with me and both of us like long walks. So we walked all around Sydney and talked it through up and down, and then yeah, he offered me the job and I thought it was a great opportunity once in a lifetime, so I took it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:30):
It's like be careful what you're good at sort of situation. Okay. So what were some of the bigger changes that you made after Jack is on board and Block execs are on board of are, "Cool, this is completely right. We need to go much bigger and think much more deeply about how AI is changing, how we build and how we should build." Or some of the bigger changes that you made from a perspective of other companies listening to this, trying to think about what they should be doing?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:07:53):
At the start, my main focus was to get block to think like a technology company. And for a long time we had had a little bit of, I'm going to call it identity drift, maybe. We were talking about ourselves as a financial services company. Some people called us FinTech, all of this stuff. But when I started working at what was then known as Square, we were always thought of as a technology company just like Google or Facebook or any of the others.

(00:08:25):
And so I wanted to get us back to that. And so the first thing I did was to try and institute a number of programs that focused on that. So everything from getting the top ICs in the company together to talk to each other, to starting a whole bunch of special projects. So we got about two to five engineers per project. There were about eight or nine different projects and we had reinstituted, the company-wide hack week.

(00:08:55):
And so all of this just kind of created a little bit of a spark of, "Hey, we're building technology again, we're trying to push the frontier again." And that's how it started, and then there were a whole number of steps after that where we went from a GM structure to a functional org structure, which was I think the key to making our transformation into being more of an AI-native company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:19):
Okay, talk more about that. What does that mean? What does that look like? Why is that so important?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:09:23):
Absolutely. So when we were in our mature phase, so when Square was working quite well, it was a very large business, and then we had started Cash App and that also followed suit. We had spun them out almost as what we call a GM structure. So they were effectively run as a portfolio of independent companies and they had their own CEOs who all reported to Jack and it was still one single executive team, but they had separate engineering practices, they had separate design teams.

(00:10:00):
They were kind of separate in almost every way except for some shared resources like our foundational resources like legal and some platforms and things like that. So I think that that was very useful for us for the stage of company that we were in, but when you really want to go deep in technology, when you really want to connect with these things that are industry changing events that are happening, you need a singular focus, and we changed the organization.

(00:10:32):
So all engineers report into one single team now, all designers report into one single team and there's single head of engineering, single head of design, et cetera. And so that was the big transformation that we made, and that meant we could really drive forward AI, we could drive forward platform and just technical depth generally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:51):
For companies that are struggling with this potentially or trying to figure out how to do this, two things I'm hearing here is start to see yourself as a technology company. It doesn't necessarily apply to every company, but seems like an important element is like we're building technology, we're not a financial company, we're not a real estate company, we're not a technology company. And then two is organize the team such that say engineers report up to an engineering leader versus a GM who maybe doesn't understand engineering as well or doesn't take it as seriously as they should.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:11:19):
Yeah, I think that's pretty much what we did. And not to lean too heavily on this, but this is what jobs did when he came back to Apple as well. He reorganized Apple to be functional, and it wasn't like we were following a playbook. We discovered this as we were investigating what it's going to take to make these teams more tech-focused and to bring our DNA back to our roots, which really was putting engineering and design first, which is what technology first means to me. So yeah, I would say to companies, find your DNA and really try to optimize for what that is in a very simple and clear way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
Okay, so you made a bunch of changes, you had this manifesto, everyone's on board, you made a bunch of changes. Functional technology first, comparing the way that your say engineering team works today versus two or three years ago, what is most different?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:12:13):
Not everyone was on board, I'll tell you that. It was quite a painful transformation. I think that one of the things that I learned the most throughout this process is that Conway's Law can be really, really powerful. So it's the law that basically says you ship your org structure. So what you're organized as in terms of teams, in terms of collaborating groups and your operating model matters a lot to what you build.

(00:12:45):
And so I think that that was essentially the biggest change is we had a lot of momentum in each of these silos, be it Cash App, be it Afterpay, be it Square or even TIDAL or music streaming service. And no one was really talking to each other, no one was really aligned on technical strategy on what we even wanted to be five years from now as a collective team. And so all those things are different now. I'm not saying it's perfect, there's still a long road ahead of us, but we at least speak the same language.

(00:13:24):
We're all have access to the same tools, we share the same policies. So a certain level of senior engineer means the same thing across the whole company. People can move from one team to another's into an area of need. All of these things are very different. But to sum it up, I would say we're technically focused and we're focused on advancing technical excellence as a goal. And that just really wasn't that true two to three years ago. There were other things we were optimizing for then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:58):
Maybe going one level deeper in terms of how people actually work at a day. So if you're looking at an engineering team, say the average engineering team and maybe also the top most optimal engineering team, how is the way they work today different from a couple of years ago?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:14:12):
In the small, certain teams that are very, very AI natives or teams that are building AI first everywhere are working much differently than before because they're using vibe code tools and they're essentially building without writing lines of code by hand, and that just wasn't true through the three years ago. I don't think it was true anywhere in the world. So that's dramatically different in teams that are still working with very heavy legacy code bases.

(00:14:47):
It's less true, but they're also encountering these background AI processes. So we have these tools that run 24/7 or run in the CI pipeline and they're analyzing vulnerabilities. They're looking at even bugs filed on tickets and trying to build patches while engineers are asleep. So they come in the next day and look at it. So I would say there are a number of ways in which they're different, but different teams have adapted in different ways depending on how close they are to the tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):
Okay, so let me lean into that AI piece, which is I think where you guys are most ahead of a lot of other companies. You guys built your own agent I think is how you describe Goose. So there's a lot of talk about productivity gains through AI. There's this camp of people are like, you don't understand how much productivity there is to gain from AI. It's the future, this is the way it's all going to work.

(00:15:46):
We're all accelerating 10X. There's also this camp where people are like, I'm so overhyped, nothing's working. People talk about it. All these pilots are failing. Nobody's actually adopting this at scale. I feel like you're probably in that first camp. What sort of gains have you seen practically from AI tools on your teams?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:16:03):
Our number one priority is through automate Block, which means getting AI and getting AI forms of automation through our entire company. And we feel that that's just at the beginning of where the utility is with all these large language models, and I think we're going to continue to see that improve. But even now, we find engineering teams that are very, very AI forward that are using Goose every day are reporting about eight to 10 hours saved per week, and this is self-reported. And then we also have a number of check metrics to try and validate that.

(00:16:45):
So we look at PRs, we look at throughput of features, we look at a whole bunch of things and we have our data scientists come up with a complicated formula that tries to distill it all into something meaningful. And we feel across the whole company, we're probably trending towards 20 to 25% of manual hours saved. And I think that's just the start of all of this. I do feel that the more AI-native companies are doing a better job of realizing this.

(00:17:17):
So companies that started just with AI startups mostly, but there is some truth to this notion that AI isn't a panacea and it's growing as well in capability. So you need to ride that wave along with it. And I think a lot of the companies aren't realizing this. They're like, "Well, where's the value?" And the truth is the value is changing every day. And so you need to be adaptable and look at what the value is today and plan for what the value will be tomorrow and then slowly expand to the areas where it's most efficacious.

(00:17:54):
I'll give you an example. One area in which we find that it's really good is for non-technical teams to be able to build little software tools for themselves. So this has been one of the most surprising and energizing uses of Goose within Block is we'll have our enterprise risk management team build a whole system for self-servicing enterprise risk, and this is compressing weeks of work into hours, or ordinarily, they would be waiting for an internal apps team or something to go and build that and they would put that on their Q2 roadmap and everyone would be twiddling their thumbs until it all clicked into place, but now you can just go and do it.

(00:18:42):
And so a lot of these kinds of use cases we're seeing an enormous amount of productivity gain in the other area, which I'm really excited about is we have this other tool called Gosling, which is a goose for mobile effectively. So it operates your Android OS at a native level using the accessibility API. And we use that for automating UI tests.

(00:19:09):
So before, you would have to hire an army of contractors or QAs who would go and click through every screen, but now we can just bake those into automated tests and then give you a report at the end. So we're seeing a lot of advantages in those types of areas, but where you have a lot of depth and a lot of really strong people come together is where AI, I think still underperforms humans. And that's something that's probably going to get better over time, but it's also something where we should lean into as humans.

(00:19:45):
So when you have some very senior engineers and they're thinking about things like architecture and design and race conditions, orchestration, things like this, that's still an area where AI isn't quite there. And so I think the companies that aren't feeling the success in AI are trying to just throw these tools at their giant code bases and hoping good things will happen, and that's not how it's playing out. Eventually, I do think it'll get there, but right now we're still in the early utility phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:18):
Holy moly, there's so much there in what you just shared. There's like five things I want to follow up on. Okay, so one is this metric you kind of alluded to, which is how you measure the impact of AI in your team. So it was human manual hours saved, is that how you describe it?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:20:35):
That's correct. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:36):
So it's roughly a fourth of an engineer's time currently is being saved by AI tooling.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:20:43):
That metric is across all teams. So that would be our support teams, our legal teams, our risk teams, all of them together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:51):
Wow.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:20:52):
And then on the engineering side, it's very variable because like I said before, it matters how big and how complex the code base is. And so if you're building a totally new Greenfields code base or you're building an app for a new platform, then we're seeing those pretty aggressive gains, but in very complex code bases that already exist, those gains are not quite there yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:18):
That's amazing. And whenever I hear a stat like this, I think an important element that people need to think about is this is the worst it will ever be. This is the lowest, this is now the baseline. And so it may not sound that crazy yet, but it's going to get crazy. Okay, the other thing that you talked about is Goose, you haven't explained what Goose is. This is a huge deal. Explain what Goose is and how important this has become to you guys.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:21:49):
So Goose is a general purpose AI agent. So you can think of it as a desktop tool or a program that you can download and install on your computer and then it has a UI. You can talk to it just like a chatbot and you can say anything from, "Hey Goose, organize my photos by category, and it has the ability to look within your photos and if there are a lot of trees, it'll organize them as nature photos. And there are a lot of people, it'll organize them as portraiture." All of this sort of stuff to writing software for you.

(00:22:30):
So it can do all of these tasks, and the way we've been able to do this is through something called a model context protocol or the MCP, which a lot of your listeners might've heard. And this is something that Anthropic came up with that we were a very early contributor to. And the model context protocol is very simply just a set of formalized wrappers around existing tools or existing capabilities. So if you have tools that you use in the enterprise, be it Salesforce or be it Snowflake or SQL, any of these things, you can wrap them in the MCP and then it exposes them to your LLM to be able to manipulate.

(00:23:16):
So until that point, the LLMs were not really able to do much other than chat, but Goose gives these brains arms and legs to go out and act in our digital world, and that's where we find it's had most impact and it's built on this fairly open protocol that anyone can implement. There have been an explosion of MCPs. Goose is entirely open source, by the way, so any of you can download it and extend it, write your own MCPs, and that's been our core successes through Goose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:54):
Okay. So essentially like Claude code with a UI, desktop app sort of thing built on top of Claude and OpenAI ChatGPT and a bunch of open source models. Is that right?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:24:06):
Yeah, it can use any model. So we have a pluggable provider system and you can either bring your own API keys and use the Claude family models or OpenAI's family models, or you can use open source models and you can download them and use them directly or via Ollama and other, there are several tools that help you do that, but essentially it's taking the capability of these models to generate text and to interpret text and applying them to real world situations.

(00:24:42):
So one example that I really like is you can ask Goose to go and build your marketing report and it has MCPs to connect to Snowflake and Tableau and Looker. So it'll write SQL to pull out data from there, it'll do some analysis and a CSV so it can write Python code on your desktop to do all that. It will generate some graphs using some JavaScript charting library that it knows about.

(00:25:11):
And then finally, it'll put this all into a PDF or Google Doc or whatever and it can even email it for you or upload it somewhere. And it's doing all of this on its own, by the way. No one's sitting here telling it that, you're just saying, "Hey, I want this report, I want this emailed here, I want these pretty charts." And it's orchestrating across all these systems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:31):
So essentially at Block, instead of using Claude or ChatGPT directly or even Cursor and all these apps, they use Goose?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:25:40):
Yeah, we allow our engineers and our general employee population to use any tools that they want. Goose is the one that's most well-integrated into all of our systems because it's built on the MCP and it's so easy to create an MCP for an existing system. So for example, if you're using a issue tracking tool and you want some AI automation added to it, before Goose, our teams would have to wait for the vendor to build that AI capability in there, or maybe there's some way in which OpenAI or Anthropic or Google would provide a general purpose capability where we could plug those in. But with Goose, that's no longer necessary with a few lines of code that an MCP represents. All these systems are orchestratable with AI basically overnight, and Goose can write its own MCPs. So it's pretty bootstrappable as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
And this is open source and basically you've spent all this time building this thing, any other company can now implement it and build on all the work you've done?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:26:51):
Yeah, and we have a lot of companies using Goose pretty actively. I don't want to name too many names, but from our competitors to our close partners, a lot of them are using Goose pretty regularly on their teams. I know Databricks talks about it a lot, but everyone you can think of in this mid-tech tier is using Goose in some form.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):
That's insane. This feels like it could've been a massive business of its own, some of the fastest growing companies in the world, basically this is their product and you've built it and given away.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:27:23):
Yeah, we believe in the power of open source and one of our core missions is to increase openness, and that means contributing to open protocols and contributing to open source. And as a tech company, we're built on a lot of open source software. I think pretty much every tech company is whether you're talking about Linux or Java or MySQL or any of these essential components, and so we feel like we have a strong imperative to give back.

(00:27:57):
We want to build things that not only are good for us and our customers, but that outlast Block and outgrow Block, that's certainly a core value for us and has been from the beginning even long before this whole AI phase. So yeah, Goose follows in that proud tradition and yeah, we're very excited that its had the success it's had.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:18):
What's the story with the name Goose, by the way? Can't help but ask.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:28:21):
Goose is a Top Gun reference. So our engineer that came up with it. He also looks exactly like Goose, so it's kind of crazy if you put them side to side, he's going to be really embarrassed with my sharing this, but that's the reason why they call it Goose, and then we lent into the whole bird theme after that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
That's incredible. There's a story I heard you share on a different podcast where there's an engineer who takes this to the extreme and has Goose watch him. Talk about that, share that story.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:28:50):
Yeah, absolutely. So he is very, very AI-focused and he's trying to extract all these crazy ideas from Goose and Goose can do all of the things that I described through specific interactions with tools, but it can also just watch your screen so it understands how to process images and process the things that it's looking at through screenshots. And so he built this system where it's essentially just watching everything he does all the time and he'll be talking to a colleague on Slack or an email and they'll be discussing some feature that they think is useful to implement.

(00:29:30):
And then a few hours later he'll find that Goose has already tried to build that feature and opened a PR for it on Git and all sorts of other wacky things like that. So it'll try to nudge him out of a workflow. If he's running over on a meeting and he's late for something else, it comes up with these creative things that he didn't program or he didn't write prompts for, but that it thinks will help him improve his productivity or improve his work day. So yeah, it's pretty crazy. You have to have the stomach for it to be that level of tied into your working tools, but it kind of shows you what's possible with tools like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:14):
Clearly this is where things are going. Once this gets good enough, I love this guy is just trying it. So it's basically watching him work and anticipating what he should be doing and does the work for him as a first draft so that he's like, "Oh, the PR is already done on this thing. We were just talking about it at this meeting." That's incredible.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:30:31):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:32):
How good is it? Where's it at? If you had to go zero to a hundred of like, "Okay, going to, all you have to do is now think and talk and that'll just do your job."

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:30:41):
Yeah, so voice is the other big part of it. It has voice processing capability, so it's always listening to what he's saying as well and trying to interpret that. I would say that this is mostly an experiment, given that he's on our core Goose team and he contributes to Goose, so he has a day job. This is a kind of thing on the side that he was developing.

(00:31:04):
So once this evolves into more of a native feature of Goose itself or other tools that we use in the enterprise, I think it can have a lot of legs, but it's already pretty good. It's probably cutting down enormous amounts of busy work that he has to do. So for example, one thing he'll do is he'll say, "Oh, I have a meeting conflict. I can't make it that time, or I have to go pick up my kid."

(00:31:32):
And Goose will automatically reschedule that meeting without him ever sitting in front of his calendar and clicking through 10 times. Yeah, so these are things that I think we were waiting for the calendar vendor to build as features into calendar, but we don't need to do that anymore because AI is able to orchestrate this for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
This isn't that guy that had four jobs at four different startups that he was able to paralyze all his work and hire people.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:31:58):
No, it's not. He's someone that I've worked with for a long time and he's been at Block for a long time. He just loves experimenting and he embodies that culture of experimentation just like our creator of Goose who did the same thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:16):
So let me pull on that thread a little bit. You're kind of seeing a glimpse of where things are going. You're very ahead of the curve in a lot of ways at Block. How do you think things will look in a couple of years in terms of how engineers work, how product teams work that's different from today?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:32:32):
I think a lot of it is dependent on the improvement of LLM performance, but I can tell you the way I'm trying to change how I work and how I'm trying to change our immediate team's way of working. So I think vibe coding has been an interesting, exciting thing, which is you talk to a chatbot essentially and it goes and builds software for you, but I think this is highly limiting.

(00:32:59):
It's very ping pong. You do something, you wait for three or four minutes and it comes back with something sort of half-baked and you have to nudge it and guide it and massage it to get where it needs to be. I think that we're going to see much more autonomy. So where we're working on a couple of experiments with Goose, with the next version of Goose where we're really trying to push it to work not just for two or three or five minutes at a time, our median session length is five minutes and on average, seven, but we're trying to push it to hours.

(00:33:36):
We're trying to say, "Hey, all these LLMs are sitting idle overnight and on weekends while humans aren't there, there's no need for that." They should be working all the time. They should be trying to build in anticipation of what we want if we go back to the earlier part of the conversation. But also I think that they should be able to build in ways that were never possible before.

(00:34:04):
Before as humans, we had limited resources, limited bandwidth, and a lot of coordination overhead. So we would have to choose the best path to try in an experiment, and I don't think we need that anymore. We need instead to be able to describe multiple different experiments in a great amount of detail. And then maybe we go to sleep and then in the morning, all those experiments are built and we can sort of throw away five or six of them.

(00:34:34):
So one of the things that I do regularly, so I write code every day, but one of the things that I do regularly is just throw away huge, huge amounts of code, and it's kind of hard for me because I've never done that before. I mean obviously engineers love deleting code, but this is different. You build a whole new system or a whole new feature and you're like, "Ah, it doesn't feel exactly right. I'm just going to delete and start over."

(00:35:00):
So I think you're going to see a lot more of that way of working. And I think that you're going to see instead of us, for example, refactoring an app to have a different UI or to evolve into its new version, we're just going to rewrite that app from scratch. And one of the things I'm really pushing our teams to think about is what would our world look like if every single release, RM minus RF deleted the entire app and rebuilt it from scratch? And so we can't really do that today, but I think this shows you some of the direction of what's possible and where these tools are taking us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):
What's interesting about that is that there's this common rule in software engineering and just product, don't ever just rewrite. Don't try to rewrite your thing. You're going to forget all of the small improvements and tweaks and bug fixes people have made over the years, and you think it's going to be the simple straightforward thing. It ends up being now it's like a year or more of just getting it back to where it was. And so interesting that AI now can make that possible, and what you're saying is that's actually maybe the way you should be working.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:36:09):
I think so. And I think that the trick is getting the AI to respect all of those incremental improvements, yeah, and sort of bake those in as a part of the specification, if you will. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:25):
Also, the point you made about this agent, just you give it a bunch of ideas that builds them overnight and then you could see, I imagine it goes even further up the stack and comes up with the ideas and then starts building them and then you're like, "Okay, oh, that was a great idea. Now I can see it immediately in the same workflow."

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:36:39):
Yeah, that's true. I was actually literally trying what you're saying just last week. And so I have this new version of Goose that we're working on and I was asking it to come up with ideas to improve itself and implement it overnight. And sometimes-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:57):
Slip problem.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:36:59):
... Sometimes it kind of goes off the script entirely and you have to sort of pull it back a bit. So I think we're not quite at that era where it's completely self-improving and completely autonomous, but I do think we're in a transition phase where we can give it that nudge and say, "Hey, here's my wishlist of 10 things that I wish you could do. Go and figure out the best way to do them." And it's successful I would say on 60% of those things, if the features are well enough described and it struggles on the remaining 40 where you have to kind of intervene and massage it. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:43):
Oh man, I'm just imagining this feature where you give it the goal of drive revenue and growth and then it's just like, "Okay, everyone's fired. Here's your paychecks. I'll take it from here."

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:37:56):
I don't think we're going to be there. I do think we're going to need a lot of human taste to anchor these AIs so they don't go off script to be honest. And that's really where our design lead and our design teams are pushing us to think, and that's a differentiator that I think will push us beyond this era of AI slop that everyone's talking about. So yeah, it's very much anchoring it into a thing that matters to people and the thing that's tasteful and useful and has value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:30):
To make that even more concrete, is there an example of something maybe AI was trying to, or a team was trying to pitch where you had to just know this is where humans are going to step in and keep things on track?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:38:43):
I'd say it was more around things like process automation or a lot of times I'll get this sort of request where a team will say, "We need to buy this new tool from this vendor because our current tool is entering X, Y and Z." Another team will say, "No, no, no, we can just use Goose to build an app that will do the same thing for us in half the time or less." And then as a human, you're sitting there thinking, "Is any of this necessary? If we just change the process, do we even need to think about building tools?" And this is the thing that AI isn't good at, it's not able to have this portfolio judgment or judgment across a global sense of what's important and what matters.

(00:39:40):
So a lot of times, I tell teams just question the base assumption, particularly our InfoSec teams because they'll twist themselves into knot sometimes trying to secure something and you'll be like, "We'll just ask the team that's building it to do it differently or to not build that at all if it doesn't matter, and then you won't have to increase your surface area of securing it." So I think those are the areas where it's better for a human to use judgment and AI has not done a great job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:11):
You make this point about building your own software, your own tools instead of buying stuff. This is a big question with AI, is it's going to replace all these SaaS apps to Salesforce over. Is there a sense of just either how much money you guys have maybe saved building your own stuff, or have you built a new-found respect for the existing SaaS software that everyone's using and pays lots of money for?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:40:31):
I think there's a trap in getting away from your core purpose as a company. And our core purpose is economic empowerment. So getting customers or merchants or artists the ability to make a sale or pay their rent or upload their latest creation to TIDAL. And I think that anything that serves that purpose, we should encourage and we should invest in, but if we're just purely looking at dollars versus dollars, then that's pulling us off that purpose.

(00:41:12):
The savings and costs that there might be in replacing a vendor tool by something you build in-house is probably not worth it in the mental bandwidth that you've lost and the amount of the team's technical focus that's being taken away. So yeah, I would say it just keep coming to the thing that matters to you as a company and then the rest will follow from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:38):
Yeah, I think people forget just how much maintenance it takes to keep something you've built. Like, "Okay, cool, we built it in a weekend and now it's years of endless maintenance and requests and support." And also to your point, it feels like it comes back to the always motto of just focus on your core competencies and then buy everything else.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:41:57):
Yeah, it's the classic 80/20 problem, and we have that enough with the apps that we build for our customers. We'll build some great experiments that really resonate, and then we have to spend a lot of time ironing out the long tail of problems. So in Cash Card, for example, we built the entire functionality of Cash Card, I would say pretty much in a weekend or maybe a week of integration and work.

(00:42:26):
And then it took a really long time to iron out all these edge cases where someone would tip twice the value of the bill and then it would completely break something in the back end, or people would use it as a gas station and they have a different way of billing your card. So yeah, it's very much that. And to your point, I would always come back to what is the reason we're doing this? Why does it matter to us and to our customers? And if it doesn't clearly satisfy that, I would just push it off as a not interesting thing.

This episode is brought to you by Persona, the verified identity platform, helping organizations onboard users fight fraud and build trust. We talk a lot on this podcast about the amazing advances in ai, but this can be a double-edged sword. For every wow moment, there are fraudsters using the same tech to wreak havoc, laundering money, taking over employee identities and impersonating businesses.

(00:43:27):
Persona helps combat these threats with automated user business and employee verification. Whether you're looking to catch candidate fraud, meet age restrictions or keep your platform safe, Persona helps you verify users in a way that's tailored to your specific needs. Best of all, Persona makes it easy to know who you're dealing with without adding friction for good users. This is why leading platforms like Etsy, LinkedIn, Square and Lyft trust Persona to secure their platform persona is also offering my listeners 500 free services per month for one full year, just head to withpersona.com/lenny to get started, that's withpersona.com/lenny.

(00:44:06):
Thanks again to Persona for sponsoring this episode. One of the biggest parts of the conversation around AI is hiring jobs, things like that. So I have two kind of this two-part question. One is just how has the rise of all these AI tools, this increased productivity impacted the way you plan head counts and hire? And then what do you look for that's different in people you're hiring now that AI is such a big part of the way you guys work?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:44:34):
I don't think that things have progressed far enough that it's really impacted in a fundamental way how many people you would need to build an app of the scale of Cash App, for example. I think what's changed for us is much different and it has nothing to do with AI, it's what we talked about earlier is moving from our GM structure to a functional structure. And in our GM structure, our incentives were always to think of engineering headcount as a commodity.

(00:45:09):
And so we would just add more engineers if we wanted to build more features and the classic mythical man person month trap or whatever it's called. And I think that moving to a functional structure completely changes that and you're like, "Well, we can leverage common platforms, common modules, we can bring in experts from across the company to advise us on how better to do this."

(00:45:38):
And so those kinds of things I think have made it much different and how we hire and we no longer see engineers as a commodity to just add 100 people to go and build the next product in Cash App. But on the AI side, we're very much looking for people that are embracing these tools and that are eager to try and learn from it. We're not looking for people who are amazing AI practitioners on the get-go.

(00:46:14):
I think we have those people and we're interested in those people if they ever want to work with us. But I'm much more keen on looking for that college grad who just really is eager to learn about these tools and open to it, or even the veteran who has embraced these tools and figured it out. And that's kind of where we're optimizing for who we look for rather than a specific set of skills.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:44):
So essentially the biggest change is just looking for people that are embracing AI, not being like, "No, I don't need this stuff. I'm an amazing engineer. I don't need to use Cursor or Goose or all these things."

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:46:55):
Yeah, a learning mindset is how I would put it. This is something that Jack our CEO talks about a lot is he wants us to be a learning first company. So everything we do, every experiment that we ship, what can we learn from it and did we feel that we gave it our best shot? And I think that that's more important to him than even sort of coming up with the right business answer every time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):
What about when you're interviewing? Are you encouraging engineers to use AI tools as they're doing exercises? How did that change over the past year or two?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:47:33):
Yeah, we're starting to do that now. So traditionally we would just use CoderPad or something like that to wipe boards or a problem or even program it in Pseudocode or near Pseudocode. But now we're looking at can you use Vibe code to build something? How comfortable are you with these tools or how are you thinking about evolving with them as well?

(00:48:04):
But it's early days yet I would say that it's not clear to me that necessarily how someone knows how to use, be it Goose or Cursor or any of these other tools matters that much to whether they're a good engineer. I still think that things that we interviewed for in the past, a critical mindset, the ability to really understand deeply the technical nature of a problem is still much more important than whether you're a fully AI native programmer or not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:37):
Another question that I've always been thinking about a lot of people wonder is what level of engineer is most benefiting from these tools? You could argue it's the junior engineers now, they could just get all this work done. You could argue it's senior engineers because they know so much more about how things work and now they could just orchestrate thousands of agents doing their bidding. What have you seen in terms of which level is benefiting most?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:48:56):
Yeah, so two answers to that. One is you're definitely right that the more senior and the more junior they are, the more comfortable or the more eager they are to adopt these AI tools. And I think that's for a variety of reasons, including some of them that you named. I think the senior people really understand in great depth how everything works.

(00:49:18):
And so they're almost relieved that this tool exists that can go and do all these things that they've done a million times before and couldn't be bothered. And then the junior people are like my niece and nephew on a BlackBerry or something, they're just blitzing through things, not BlackBerry in the early days and iPhones now, they're blitzing through a text message when I'm still seek and destroying through my keyboard, shows you how old I am.

(00:49:50):
So I think there's that, but I think the non-technical people using AI agents and programming tools to build things is really what's been surprising and really amazing. And I think that speaks to how these roles are going to evolve in the future. The lines are going to be blurred between whether you're in legal or in risk or in engineering and design even. And so I think that the people that are able to embrace it to optimize for their particular work day and their particular set of tasks are really who are showing the most impact from these tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):
It's interesting. No one talks about that element of engineering productivity, which is the reduction of asks from all the other parts of the company to build random one-off things. That feels like a huge productivity gain for engineers.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:50:47):
It is massive, although I think that it's a little bit like the analogy of if you build a bigger highway, you'll just get more cars on the road. So I think the fact that everyone's building software means that there's more software to be built, more coordination to happen, and everyone's more eager to ship things faster and with greater results. And so we're just seeing an overall uptake in velocity and the ask for more features, if that makes sense. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:22):
Absolutely. And it connects to your point about you're not slowing hiring. What I'm hearing is just headcount, hiring desires for more engineers, more product people is not slowing at all. You're basically, it's as if AI wasn't really there.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:51:37):
We're being more thoughtful about it. So like I said, we were looking at as a commodity in the GM era, and now that we're functional, it's much less about how many engineers we need as a function of the number of features we have in Square or Cash App and in the functional org structure, we think of it much more as what are the areas of optimization? Where can we build depth and what really accelerates our priorities through things like modularization reuse and going deep into platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:12):
I love this hot take of if you're trying to be more productive, forget AI, just re-org into a functional structure.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:52:21):
It's not wrong in some ways. So here's another really interesting example where we are trying to improve our build times and you were using Goose and a lot of other tools to help us with this too, and they've done remarkable things. So we have this really cool tool that analyzes our test suites and selects the right test to run for changes that were made.

(00:52:50):
So we cut down basically 50% of test runs this way, which is pretty great, and we're not warming the planet as much with all these unnecessary CPU cycles being wasted on tests. But then things like offloading tests to the cloud or simply just deleting tests that don't make sense anymore, probably save you two to three times that.

(00:53:14):
So there is still a portfolio approach that you need to take for lack of a better term. It's like that example I told you earlier about should we buy a vendor tool? Should we build this in-house? It's like, "Well, do we even need to do this process at all?" So in some ways, structure matters more than the efficacy of the tools you have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):
Wise words makes me think about Elon has this whole process for optimize stuff and one of the steps is like, "Do we even need this thing before we start out optimizing and automating it?" Before I zoom out and ask about just general lessons that you've learned over the course of your career, is there anything else that you think might be really valuable or useful to folks that are trying to lean in further into AI or just help their teams think a little bit more forward thinking?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:54:04):
I would say really try and use these tools yourself. So the way in which I think we've been able to drive most of the adoption is Jack uses Goose, I use Goose, our executive team all have used Goose and use it regularly and use other AI programming tools and assistance as well, and we do it every single day.

(00:54:31):
And so we learn a lot about how our own workflow can change, and that's going to tell you so much more about how are you going to change your organization's workflow than if you're reading a bunch of think pieces on LinkedIn or Harvard Business Review or whatever it is, and then trying to get your teams to follow suit. So I think we do this with everything. It's feel it, use the product yourself, feel it, understand its strengths and weaknesses and its ergonomics, and then figure out how to apply it to your teams.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:06):
Something I've found helpful in doing that, which I completely agree with, which is stop reading about it, stop listening to us talking about it, just build some stuff. The thing that I found really helpful there is have a specific task or problem you want to solve for yourself because that really motivates you and makes it very real.

(00:55:21):
For example, just the other day, I was trying to pull images out of a Google Doc. Google Doc, it's like I think of it as Hotel California. You put images in there, but there's no way to get them back out unless you do some crazy stuff. So I just went to Lovable and like Bill an app, or I can give you a Google Doc URL and let me download the images real easily and bam. Perfect.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:55:41):
Yeah, great example. I did something like this a couple months ago as well, where my son has a whole bunch of therapies, he has additional needs, and so I was trying to gather the receipts for all these therapies and share them with my wife and she will claim it from our insurer, and I was really struggling to do this because they're in various forms.

(00:56:05):
There are screenshots in some cases or PDFs or whatever. So I asked Goose to do this and it was all sitting on my laptop and Goose figured out that it could put all of these receipts into my Apple Notes app into a single note. It converted it to HTML so it would sync seamlessly to my phone and then I could email it or share it with her from there.

(00:56:30):
And that's just something I just never would've thought of. And it did this using Apple Script, so it just controlled my computer for me in the background. Yeah, so these are surprising ways in which these tools help us, and the more you use them to solve real problems to your point, the more you understand what their strengths are and where you can deploy them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):
I love this example. So did you just go to Goose and be like, "Here's the problem I have, how would you solve it?"

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:56:56):
Yeah, pretty much. I said, "I have all these receipts there in Google Drive, so we have similar origin problem there and I need to get them into a single form and I need to collate the totals and do all this." So it tried a few approaches first. It tried to download them and it tried to read them using a PDF reader and this and that. And then the thing about Goose that I think a lot of the other AI agents learn from us as well is if it tries a few things and fails, it'll back up and it'll try a different route and it'll just keep going until it makes some progress.

(00:57:33):
And that's what it did. Then it picked Apple Script as a way to do it because it had the MCP extension to control my computer, and this is the same thing that our engineer, we were talking about the other day uses to watch his screen and things like that, but this was a very focused problem and it managed to do that. So yeah, it's surprising what these tools can do and allowing them the flexibility to do that is a big part of learning how to use them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
That's cool. I love the, by the way, can you run Goose as a regular person? Can you just download Goose and use that instead of Claude?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:58:08):
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. You can just download it from our URL. We can share it in the show notes for you and yeah, you can install it. It comes for Mac and Windows and Linux I believe. It's an electron app, so it'll work on all of them. It also has a command line, so for people who are more comfortable using that, we have that UI as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:32):
Wow, you really are competing with these massive foundational model companies building. What's the simplest way to compare Goose to something else? Is it like this Claude code, this simplest comparison or something else?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:58:43):
I think it's a bit different than Claude Code because at its core, Goose is a platform that implements MCPs. So MCPs give it this dynamically extensible nature so it can do all of these things for you, whether it's automating things like we were talking about with Google Docs and notes and things like that, or it can do straight up programming tasks for you using other MCPs.

(00:59:11):
It can index code and do it that way. So it's really more of an extensible platform. So I would say it sits somewhere between your classic AI assistant where you just ask it, "What's the weather today? Can you calculate how many months it's been since this date?" Or whatever it is, to the more focused cursors and Claude codes of the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):
Basically, it's everything combined wholly and free. You pay for the LM tokens, but yeah.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (00:59:46):
Yeah, there's not like an open source models which-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:50):
Oh my God, this is crazy. What a cool team to be on building Goose at Block. Must having must be having so much fun. Oh man. Okay. Let me zoom out a little bit. So you've been CTO in LinkedIn right now for just about two years. What's something that you wish you knew before you stepped in this role? If you could go back a couple years and just whisper a few tips and tricks or lessons into your ear, what would they be?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:00:13):
I think maybe two different things. One is just the power of Conway's Law, like we talked about before. It's like how difficult it is to change outcomes without changing the structure of relationships between people in an organization. And I think I always kind of knew that at some level, but really appreciating it in a visceral way is big. The other thing that I really learned the hard way maybe is you only hear about it when things are going wrong.

(01:00:49):
So when things are going well, you kind of have this eerie silence and you're like, "Well, am I doing the right things here? Am I focusing on the right problems?" So having a bit of judgment, having a bit of time to step back and look at things holistically, those are things that you really need to make time for and do on a regular basis, which I wish I had known when I took up the role.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):
Looking back at your time at Block, I keep trying to, I almost say Square because I'm so used to that over the air, but I know Block is the name of the broader company and Square is just one. Just so people understand, Square is one business unit, one product within Block.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:01:28):
Correct, yeah, we have Square, Afterpay, Cash App and TIDAL are four major brands, and then we also have Bitkey and Proto that are focused on Bitcoin for us and we chip hardware in those two brands.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:44):
Okay, great. I think that some people are like, what are you guys talking about? Okay, cool. So reflecting back on your time at Block, what's maybe the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or building teams that goes against what most people believe, say common startup wisdom?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:02:02):
I think code quality is one. Being an engineer. I learned this very early on and it keeps coming true over and over and over again. A lot of engineers think that code quality is important to building a successful product. The two have nothing to do with each other, but my favorite example is YouTube. I was working at Google around the time YouTube was acquired and I just remember there was this whole wash of angst about how horrible the YouTube code base is and how terrible their architecture is, and they're storing videos as blobs in MySQL and whatnot.

(01:02:41):
And you could argue that YouTube is the most successful product at Google by a long way, maybe more successful than many of their others combined. And so it really has very little to do with how well it was architected because the flip side of that Google video, which is product that I don't know if people remember, it existed before YouTube. It supported more formats, it supported higher resolution.

(01:03:11):
You could upload hour long videos, YouTube had none of this. It just had the one or two minute quick video thing and it's far and away, blown away its competition. And so I think just keeping that front and center is why are we building these tools or these apps or these products? They're for people to solve a specific problem. So in our case, it's for a square merchant to make a sale, to sell coffee to you or to sell something they've made. And that's really what's important.

(01:03:49):
It's not really important how well our Android platform performs unless it's serving that need. And so I think that's been a really hard one for me over my career. And I continually encounter engineers who think we need to refactor, we need to do this in a better way. And then I'm like, "No, all this code could be thrown away tomorrow. So just focus on what we're trying to build and whom we're trying to build for."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):
That is an incredible insight and lesson. This YouTube story is so fun and such a good example. You're saying they were storing the video content in a MySQL set like row and column as a blob data.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:04:34):
Yeah, this is what, I didn't actually look the code so I couldn't verify it, but this was the common wisdom. And then they had an entirely Python stack that was incredibly slow compared to the state-of-the-art C++ and Java servers that we had hyper-optimized at Google back in those days.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
That is hilarious. It makes me think about also companies when you look inside a company, if you work at a company, you're just like, "This is just pure chaos. No one knows what's going on. This is just about to all fall apart." And that's basically what it's like at every successful hyper-growth company.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:05:14):
Yeah, there's some truth to that for sure. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
And so I think again, it's just there's so much more that is more important to the success of a business. And it's what you said is are you solving a real problem for people? Can you get in their hands? Can you continue solving real problems for them? It's not about the quality of the code, it's not how well you operate internally.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:05:32):
Absolutely. I think on Cash App we had that as well. So in the early days of Cash App, I was head of engineering from when we were about 10 engineers to 200 plus and took us to about 10 plus or 20 million users thereabouts. And there was a very similar thing there. From the outside it looked like everything was really chaotic. It's like people would build random experiments and ship them and it just didn't look like we were following strict policies on things like software life cycle and stuff like that, and it was kind of true.

(01:06:13):
And my philosophy was always, we have all these brilliant engineers and I'm going to do more harm than good by trying to harness them into very strict blinkered areas. If they want to spin their wheels building something that is a complete waste of time for a little bit. But at the same time, if they're delivering these amazing things on the flip side, then I'll almost allow that. I'll be okay with that.

(01:06:44):
And it's a fine balance because engineers can really go off and into rabbit holes if you let them. But yeah, there's a certain amount of creativity that chaos breeds and you have to know how to build controlled chaos in some ways. So you have to create a foundation that isn't liable to rupture. You have major liability problems or something like that, or you're going to lose money in our case. And so as long as those things are bedded down and you allow your engineers to have the freedom to experiment and iterate and do the things that energizes them, that's the ideal.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:26):
Speaking of controlled chaos, one of your titles during your time at Block, I guess this was while you were actually at Square, was Mad Scientist for four and a half years.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:07:38):
Yeah, that was a time when I was working part-time, mostly because I had very young kids with lots of additional needs and I was a consultant on various different projects and I was trying to help some wacky things get off the ground. And yeah, I'm really grateful to Block that they afforded me the freedom to have that role in my career as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:08):
Maybe one more question before I take us to Fail Corner, which I'll explain. So you've shared a few lessons of things you've learned over the course of your career. Are there any other, just let's say core leadership lessons that you've learned that you think have been important to you being successful at the work that you've done?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:08:26):
I think start small with everything. If you try to boil the ocean to make a cup of tea, I don't know who said that, but it's a really a useful phrase that I keep coming back to. You'll never get there. So if you're making a cup of tea, just make the cup of tea. You don't need to boil all the water that there is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:47):
That sounds like really not delicious tea. Ocean water.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:08:52):
Yeah, I think there's another one of, I think Carl Sagan said, "If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you have to first invent the universe." So it's like narrow your scope to the thing that's in front of you and that's achievable. And so that I think is really important and that's one of our core tenets and always has been even when we were just Square in the early days, start small.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
Is there an example that maybe worked really well or maybe didn't work?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:09:23):
Yeah, Goose started small. It was just an engineer working on their own time trying to build something that was useful and that satisfied a thesis that they had. So Brad, our creator of Goose, believed very early on, I think long before we heard the buzzword going around that agents would be how we unlock value from LLMs. And he built a proof concept and he shared it with a bunch of people. He shared it with Databricks and Anthropic, got them excited and learned a lot from them.

(01:09:59):
And so it just sort of built momentum from there. And even internally, it was quite a similar thing. Cash App itself was like that and Cash App started more or less as a hack week sort of idea and grew into a bigger and bigger and bigger thing. So a lot of our projects start with these small experiments that we try to then build on top of. We became the very first company that was a public company to launch a Bitcoin product. And that was again a hack week idea that actually Jack and me and another engineer worked on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
That was the hackathon team? You and Jack Dorsey and an engineer?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:10:44):
Yeah, it was the three of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):
Unreal.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:10:48):
Yeah, and it was great. We went and bought a cup of coffee, a blue bottle, and it was bought using Bitcoin over cash card. And I'll tell you those in hindsight, probably the most expensive cup of coffee.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:02):
What was Bitcoin at? 20,000?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:11:02):
I think it was 6,000 or 7,000 back then. I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:07):
It's like 120,000 now. Great.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:11:12):
But yeah, it's an example of how you get to a working useful product to people if you focus on a small thing first in a build.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):
And just to double down on this counter too. "Okay, we have a big idea, we're just going to put a bunch of resources on it and go big immediately."

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:11:29):
Yeah, absolutely. And I've been part of teams like that too. So in my career, I worked at Google on this product called Google Wave, which was trying to be everything to everyone and we were 70, 80 engineers building this thing before it even really had any users outside Google. And so I think that's an example of something that started big, tried to go big on day one and probably lacked some of that meeting the earth where reality lies and adapting accordingly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:08):
I remember Google Wave. Absolutely. It was beautiful. A lot of hype. I don't remember what it was for specifically, but it looked really nice.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:12:15):
Yeah, a lot of learnings from that one for me. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):
What else? Any other big lessons?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:12:21):
Those two are the big ones, but I would also say question base assumptions on everything. Sometimes we get into traps where we are as professionals, hyper focused on what we're building that day, that week, that month. And we don't stop to think should we even build this at all? Or what's the purpose of building this?

(01:12:46):
Could we build something completely different that would matter more to our core reason for being? So I would say, yeah, question the sort of base assumptions. It's somewhat of a cliche, but you really need to remind yourself to apply it over and over and over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:03):
I had a colleague of yours on the podcast back in the day, IO, who worked with you on Cash App.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:13:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:09):
He's a friend of mine, he's amazing. He had a quote along those lines of just like, I forget exactly what it was, but it was just get to the bare metal of the thing that you're working on, just touch the thing that you're building and go to the base of it to really understand what's going on. And I imagine that was really important with Building Cash App and Cash Card.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:13:26):
Yeah, IO is one of the best product people I've ever worked with and one of my closest friends actually. So absolutely with him, and you on that one, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:38):
Okay. I'm going to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast I call Fail Corner. You already shared one example of a product that failed that you worked on. I'm curious if there's another, and the question is just what's the product you worked on that did not work out? Because people listening to this hear all these amazing successful people come on the podcast, share all these stories of success, endless success, but they don't hear the stories when things don't work out. And so this question is just, "What's a product you worked on that didn't work out and what did that teach you?"

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:14:08):
It's a very valuable point. My career has basically been a string of failed product on top of failed product. And I think that, "Yeah, the Google wave example's there." I worked for Hot Minute on Google+, which was another epic failure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):
Good one.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:14:23):
I worked at this social networking startup called Secret, which burned hot for a bright minute and then blew up. And then there was an email startup that we did, and that was, again, very promising, and then that fizzled. So the co-founder of Canva and I worked on that one. So there's been a whole string of failures, but at each point, I think I learned something and I learned that I need to never make that class of failures or errors again.

(01:15:01):
And so Cash App was probably the big success for me that a product that I worked on that was very early on and grew to be this giant business and product that people love. So yeah, been my career is essentially taking the learnings from all these failures, getting some humility out of it in the process too, coming into things, willing to listen to other people's points of view, critical points of view, and not just thinking that I have all the answers, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):
And I bet all these products that failed had really beautiful code. A lot of really good architecture decisions were made. Some of them, some of them were awful in every way. So many reasons for it to fail. Incredible. Dhanji, is there anything else that you wanted to share or I don't know, double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:15:59):
I would say I think that we're in this era of a lot of change and people are scared or reticent or uncertain about where things are going. And I think that look at the things that matter to you. For us, it's open source, open protocols, improving access for everyone. I've been very lucky in my career to only work on products that are either free or almost free to anyone or they have a free tier and then you pay for some premium services and that are usable by everyone. So anyone can become a Square seller.

(01:16:42):
I remember even in the early days, people used it to pay each other as a peer-to-peer money transfer system and that's why we built Cash App and that was really successful on the back of that. So I think it's really look at the things that are important to you and optimize for them. It's not really that important that the technology trends are growing in a certain way because technology is here to serve us, and if we have an important reason for being and an important purpose, then we can make that technology serve us. And that's much more important than being deep with the technology or being at the forefront of every trend.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
Such great advice when there's so much to pay attention to and so much happening. So stressful to feel like I'm just not aware of all the things. I'm not as good as all these people I'm seeing on social media, but what's happening with AI, I'm just so behind. What I'm hearing from you is just like what is actually important to you? And just do that. Don't feel like you need to be the best at everything that's happening on top of all the latest AI news.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:17:51):
Yeah, exactly. And if it's not meaningful and fun, then you shouldn't be doing it probably.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:58):
With that Dhanji, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:18:03):
Okay. Shoot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):
I see so many books behind you. So I love this first question. I'm excited to see what you pick. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:18:12):
Yeah, so I very much of the opinion that you shouldn't read books that are about your daily work or your professional life. I read fiction, I read the classics, I read poetry, philosophy, history. These are the books I really enjoy. And I think it expands your mind and gives you creative ideas and helps you question things about the human condition.

(01:18:39):
And that's much more valuable than some self-help book or some get good at being an engineering manager book. So yeah, having said that, the Master in Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov is one that I really love. It's a masterpiece of Russian literature. And then I've always been drawn to Tennyson's poetry and I find that in the times when I'm most uncertain or grieving, Tennyson's poetry has always resonated with me and helped me find a center.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):
Wow. Never heard these recommendations before. I'm really excited to check these out. Very cool for a CTO of a big tech company. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:19:30):
Alien Earth I think is pretty awesome. It's by Noah Hawley who did the Fargo TV series. And so it's someone with all of these incredible skills in high art filmmaking who's doing a pulp sci-fi show, and it just looks stunning and it feels stunning and it captures all of that essential alien pulpiness that makes it so interesting and fun. So I really like that, and I'm also watching Slow Horses, which I think is one of the better shows on TV.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:04):
Love Slow Horses. The new season's Out, think the fifth episode just dropped the day we're recording this. So I love that show. Alien Earth also just watched it, so creepy and just like all these slimy, gooey little creatures just crawling around.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:20:16):
Yeah, I just love the aesthetic and they captured something essential about the original Alien and yeah, they do it, but every scene in Alien Earth feels like you're watching a painting or something or someone's reading a novel to you. It's really unfolds very thoughtfully.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
I've never watched any alien content in my life and I really enjoyed Alien Earth. I will say the ending, I was just like, it felt like it kind of slowed down a bit. I'm just like, "All right, I guess I see where it's going now." But it was really fun to watch. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you really enjoyed? Sorry, a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really enjoy? It could be an app, could be an gadget, could be some kitchen thing.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:20:58):
Well, I'm a gamer. I love playing games. So for me it's the Steam Deck, the Steam Deck OLED, which is their latest version. It's like this gorgeous piece of hardware that lets you play the best games out there, but it's totally extensible and customizable. And in this era where we're constantly told by big tech companies that we need to lock everything down, we need to lock down the user experience and customizability in order to have things work for people.

(01:21:28):
I think Valve showed that's totally unnecessary and totally wrong, and you can build the Steam Deck. You can install competing app stores, you can install Windows on it. You can treat it like a computer, write programs, which I have done to run on it. So yeah, I think it's an incredible thing and it looks beautiful and it works great. So yeah, big fan.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to often in work or in life?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:21:55):
If you're not waking up in the morning feeling energized about what you're going to do that day in your professional life, then change something, quit if that's what it comes down to, or find a new way of doing what you're doing. Just don't accept what's meted out to you. So that's how I've tried to do things, and sometimes it works, sometimes not, but yeah, it's a good thing to ask yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:25):
I really love this advice. It's really hard to do that for a lot of people. Is there anything that has helped you get over that fear of just like, "Oh man, I'm going to quit this thing. I don't know where I'm going to go next."

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:22:36):
The main thing is telling yourself that a year from now, you're going to look back on what looks like a monumental problem, a life-changing thing, and you're going to be like, "Oh, that was so trivial." A lot of times we get into these traps where we're overthinking something or really nervous about making a change, but in hindsight, those don't seem that big.

(01:23:05):
And all the time that's passed since and all the events that have happened teach you that there's more to the world and it's never too late to do something useful or never too late to do something that's for yourself and improving yourself. So yeah, I think just kind of remembering that things are not as big or bleak or decisive as they seem in the moment is always important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:30):
Final question. So you were a mad scientist at Square for many years. Do you have another favorite mad scientist from pop culture or real life?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:23:41):
That's an interesting one. I think the image that always comes to my mind is Doc Brown from Back to the Future. I feel like he's the canonical mad scientist of my generation anyway, but there've been a lot in video games and stuff too, but he was the one that was like, "I'm just going to do this crazy thing because I almost have this burning desire, need to do it, and whether I want to or not, I must build this time machine." And he spends the entire movie trying to fix the problems that it creates. But yeah, he has always been a really fun character for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:20):
You know what? I think about Pinky from Pinky in the Brain.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:24:24):
Oh yeah, that's a good one too. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
Oh man. Dhanji, this was awesome. You were wonderful. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions before we actually wrap up. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more about say Goose or anything else going on at Block? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:24:43):
Check out our GitHub pages for Goose and all of the other open source projects we have at Block. So there's a lot that's useful there. We do a lot on Android open source as well, so check that stuff out. You can always find me on LinkedIn, so feel free to connect. I'm very happy to be contacted.

(01:25:06):
And I would say the way people can be useful is, again, going back to this era we're in of a lot of change and uncertainty, I think people that demand more of their companies, of their employers, of their teams, demand something better. At Block, we always ask, "Can we default to making this open source? Can we build this for people that are not just us or our customers? Can everyone benefit?"

(01:25:37):
And I think that's particularly important in this era of AI where everyone's locking themselves in walled gardens and trying to capture parts of the platform that are emerging. So yeah, just demand more of people. The internet was created as a promise for open sharing of information to the benefit of all, and I think that AI should realize that for us. And so yeah, just demand that of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):
A really beautiful way to end it. Dhanji, thank you so much for being here.

Dhanji R. Prasanna (01:26:11):
Thank you, Lenny. I really appreciated it. Thank you.
