# Product management theater | Marty Cagan (Silicon Valley Product Group)

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams. They're the only platform with product level AI, meaning it analyzes data across all of your studies to centralize the most important product opportunities, trends, and correlations in one real time feed. Visit sprig.com/lenny to learn more and get 10% off. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's getE-P-P-O.com/lenny. Marty Cagan, welcome back to the podcast.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams.

Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's getE-P-P-O.com/lenny. Marty Cagan, welcome back to the podcast.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

# Why experts writing AI evals is creating the fastest-growing companies in history | Brendan Foody

## Transcript

Brendan Foody (00:00:00):
The wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):
We are entering the era of evals.

Brendan Foody (00:00:07):
We started working with all of the top AI labs. What the labs need is labor marketplace. They actually need extraordinary professionals that can measure model capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):
They found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history.

Brendan Foody (00:00:20):
We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, fastest ascent in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
Why is this so valuable?

Brendan Foody (00:00:29):
The market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. The lab's primary bottleneck to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
There's this tweet that you retweeted. "If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs."

Brendan Foody (00:00:49):
It's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts. And I think the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, but very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):
I talked to a lot of people about what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better?

Brendan Foody (00:01:12):
How can they leverage this technology to do so much more? We'll give people interviews where we say, "Use whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):
Today, my guest is Brendan Foody, CEO and co-founder of Mercor. Mercor is the fastest-growing company in history to go from 1 to $500 million in revenue. They did this in 17 months, less than a year and a half. Brendan is also the youngest unicorn founder ever. They just raised $100 million at $2 billion valuation. Mercor, if you haven't heard of them, helps AI labs and AI companies hire experts to help them train their models using AI. They've never had a customer churn, their net retention is over 1,600%, and they're on a nine-figure revenue run rate.

(00:01:59):
In our conversation, we talk about the increasing value and importance of evals, the landscape of AI training companies like Mercor, and why they've become so important and valuable, how Brendan discovered this opportunity, his insights on what product market fit looks like, the core tenets he's instilled within his organization that have allowed him to build the fastest growing company in history, what people writing evals for labs are actually doing day to day, which skills and jobs are going to last the longest with the rise of AI, why he doesn't think we'll see AGI or superintelligence anytime soon, and so much more. This episode is incredible. You need to hear this.

(00:05:42):
Brendan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brendan Foody (00:05:45):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny. I'm a huge fan, and so excited to have a conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
I'm really excited to have this conversation as well. I'm a huge fan of yours. I'm excited for more people to learn about you and what you're building.

(00:05:57):
I want to start with a tweet that you have pinned at the top of your Twitter feed right now, and here's the tweet. "We are now working with six out of the Magnificent 7, all of the top five AI labs, most of the AI application layer companies. One trend is common across every customer. We are entering the era of evals."

(00:06:19):
The reason this caught my attention is that's one of the most recurring trends on this podcast, people talking about the increasing value of learning how to do evals well and the value of evals for companies. It feels like still people don't know what the hell this is what we're talking about, why this is so important. Talk about just what you think people are still missing, what they need to know, what this era of evals means.

Brendan Foody (00:06:39):
If the model is the product, then the eval is the product requirement document. And the way that researchers' day-to-day looks is that they'll run dozens of experiments where they'll make small improvements on an eval set. And reinforcement learning is becoming so effective that once they have an eval, they can help climb it. If you look at just how fast people were able to saturate Olympiad Math once they focused on it, how fast we're even saturating SWE-bench once we focus on it. And so in many ways, the barrier to applying agents the entire economy to automate every workflow is how do we measure success? How do we eval it? And write the PRDs for everything that we want agents to do, which Mercor is obviously a huge part of doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:25):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Oh, yeah. Okay, shit. I got to really pay attention to this eval stuff." Any advice about learning how to do this well? What companies that are doing this well are doing differently? Help people get better at this thing.

Brendan Foody (00:07:39):
Yeah. I think that for enterprises especially, the core way to think about it is how can they build a test or systematic way to measure how well AI automates their core value chain? So if it's an architecture firm that's producing these architecture diagrams of what they provide to their end customer, how can they effectively measure that? And each company has its own value chain or maybe a handful of them if it's a multi-product company. And just thinking about how they measure that is the prerequisite to really effectively applying AI throughout their entire business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):
I saw you talking about this on the No Priors podcast with Sarah and Elad, and I don't know if it was after this or before this, but Sarah tweeted, "Evals equals your new marketing." What does that mean? What do you think she's saying there?

Brendan Foody (00:08:32):
Yeah. Well, it ties to what I said earlier about how if the model is the product, evals are the PRD, but also subsequently the sales collateral, right? Because evals are what you give to researchers to show them what they should be building and going on, but they're also the way that you demonstrate the efficacy of capabilities.

(00:08:51):
And historically, everyone's been pointing to these academic evals of PhD level reasoning with GPQA, Humanity's Last Exam, or Olympiad Math, but now it's moving towards the capabilities that people practically care about of how do we get models to automate the way that we build a software platform or automate the way that we do an investment banking analysis. And I think labs as well as application layer companies will increasingly use evals to demonstrate the capabilities of their models and their products.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:26):
Okay. So let's build on this and zoom out a little bit and talk about the landscape of the market that you're in. And I was just reflecting on this as I was preparing for this conversation. If you think about the companies growing faster than any company's ever grown in history, there's essentially three buckets. There's the foundational model companies, there's vibe coding apps, Cursor and Loveable and Bolt and Replit and all these here, and then there's data labeling data companies like you. So I've had the CEO of Handshake on the podcast. I have the CEO of Scale coming on. There's also Surge. There's you guys. Help us just understand the landscape of what this is all about because I think people don't really know what the hell's going on and see all these companies growing like crazy.

Brendan Foody (00:10:06):
Yeah, I'll give a little bit of the origin story, incorporate in that and how it frames the landscape. Because when we started the company, I met my co-founders when we were 14 years old. We started the company together when we were 19 initially, in January 2023, initially hiring people internationally, matching them with our friends and automating all the processes of how we did that. So similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decided to hire. We automated all of those processes with LLMs, bootstrap the company to a million dollar revenue run rate before we dropped out of college.

(00:10:40):
And then a handful of other things happened, but we met OpenAI and we saw that there was this enormous transition in the human data market where it was moving away from this crowdsourcing problem of how do you find low and medium skilled people that can write barely grammatically correct sentences for early versions of LLMs and moving towards this sourcing and vetting problem. How do we source and assess the best professionals, the experienced? Think software engineers, the investment bankers and doctors and lawyers that can actually help to evaluate and interpret all of the capabilities that people want models to have.

(00:11:21):
So from there, we start working with all of the top AI labs. We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, and it's been an extraordinary journey and super exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:36):
Okay. First of all, that is out of control. I don't know if people understand. I think this is the first time you're sharing that number. I know we're recording this, you'll have announced it by now, but 1 to 400 million in revenue in 16 months.

Brendan Foody (00:11:49):
Exactly. So fastest ascent in history, which is an exciting statistic we're very proud of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
Okay. So something big is happening here. Why is this so valuable? What is going on here? So it's just to try to summarize what you guys do simply is you help hire people for labs to help them train their models, and you help them find not just generalist labor, but experts, helping them with very specific gaps in the model's knowledge.

Brendan Foody (00:12:21):
Yeah, precisely. And so it really ties to your first question around the era of evals that's framing all of this, which is that the lab's primary bottleneck to being able to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model, both to use it as the eval for the tests that they're measuring their progress against, as well as the verifiers in an RL environment to then reward the model, improve capabilities, et cetera. And they need this across every domain for every capability that models don't know how to use. And the wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities where Mercor is sitting at the forefront and the primary bottleneck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:12):
Okay, what are these people actually doing? So what's an example of a kind of person that is sought after? And then what are they doing sitting there at the computer?

Brendan Foody (00:13:19):
Effectively, the market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. So I'll make that very concrete. Say you have a model that you want to write a red line for a contract in the way that a lawyer would, and it makes a handful of mistakes, misses a bunch of key points in doing so. What you could do is have a lawyer create a rubric similar to how a professor might create a rubric to create a deliverable for what are the things we want the model to be able to do?

(00:13:50):
So it can effectively score that, right? Plus however much of it identifies this or XYZ key point. And that's really the foundation to measuring what does progress look like for models? Is this model achieving the capabilities that these professionals want? As well as how do we use this as training data to reward and to reinforce a lot of the capabilities that people want models to achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:19):
Okay, so they're essentially writing evals just to connect it back to original conversation.

Brendan Foody (00:14:23):
Exactly. Well, that's an interesting thing is everyone talks about RL environment. I feel like the two hot button things are like RL environments and evals, but one thing like Andrej Karpathy's tweeted out about a bunch is there's not actually a nuance. It's in the data type. It's more just a different semantic way of describing what it's being used for. But ultimately, it's just some stasis point for how do you measure what good looks like? And you can use that either as the benchmark to the sales collateral, as Sarah was saying, to say, here is why are models the best model in the world and here's the capabilities that we've been working towards, or you can use it on the post-training side to reward certain model trajectories and achieve those capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Okay. So say this lawyer, this person is writing, "Here's what a great red line contract looks like and here's the rubric of what excellent is." Then are they also providing data, like actual examples of red line documents as a part of that?

Brendan Foody (00:15:22):
They may. The data landscape historically has included two kinds of data. The first is supervised fine-tuning data, which is input/output. When people think about fine-tuning in the historical sense, that's what it is. The second is RLHF where the model will generate a couple of examples. We'll choose which is the most popular example.

(00:15:43):
What everyone is generally moving towards is reinforcement learning from AI feedback instead of human feedback where you have instead the human defined some sort of success criteria, some way to measure that. And examples in code, it could be a unit test. We can scalably measure success and other domains that could be a rubric. And then you use that to incentivize model capabilities. And it's far more scalable and data-efficient, and so that's why a lot of the broader trend in the market across the board is moving towards RLHF to both eval models as well as improved capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:24):
I had one of the co-founders of Anthropic on. He said exactly the same thing. That's what they've done at Anthropic, is move towards AI-driven reinforcement learning.

(00:16:32):
So essentially, if I can understand this correctly, I'm the lay person here trying to understand this on behalf of the audience. So essentially a lawyer is like, "Here's what correct looks like for redlining," and then it's AI is just on its own almost, just like, "I'm going to try to get this. I'm going to try to improve on this and I know if I'm heading the right direction based on this eval/rubric I've been given."

Brendan Foody (00:16:55):
Exactly. Applying all of the criteria of what good looks like similar to how the TA might apply the professor's criteria of does the student's response meet this criteria or this criteria plus however many planes, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:10):
Awesome, okay. Let me shift to talking about the broader labor market here. So there's two parts to this question as we talk about this. One is just how long will we need to do this? You guys grew so incredibly fast. Is there a point of like, "Okay, we don't need humans. We're tapped out." So let's start there and then I'll ask a broader question.

Brendan Foody (00:17:29):
So the key question is how long there's going to be things in the economy that humans can do that AI can't do? And I think there's certainly a bucket of people that say we're going to have superintelligence within three years and humans won't play a role in the economy. And that's one school of thought.

(00:17:46):
Our perspective is very different. Our perspective is that these models are extraordinary and automating a lot of things very quickly, but there's a lot of things that they're horrible at. Even still, it can't schedule time on my calendar. It can't draft emails for me. It can't use basic tools. And we need evals for everything. For everything that the models can't do, we need evals for the tool use, evals for the long horizon reasoning.

(00:18:12):
Imagine in 10 years when we want models to be able to go out and build a startup for 30 days. We need evals for that to effectively reward it. And I think that that road to improving models will last for as long as there is anything in the economy that humans can do which models can't and be a huge portion of what the future of work looks like. And so our mission is creating the future of work, and I think that this is a really exciting industry and giving us a glimpse into the direction that everything is headed towards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):
There's this tweet that you retweeted that I want to ask you about. "If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs."

Brendan Foody (00:18:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:00):
What does that mean to you? What is this person implying? And it's basically what you're saying is we're just helping train models.

Brendan Foody (00:19:06):
It speaks to conversations I've had with a lot of researchers and executives at top labs, which is that it's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts for us to then have rubrics or other kinds of verifiers. And that is really exciting in so many ways.

(00:19:32):
Because I think let's draw an analog to other revolutions where when we had the industrial revolution, everyone was freaking out about losing their jobs, but there was this whole new class of jobs of how do we build the machines? How do we have knowledge work? How do we create everything new? And I think that the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, right? Sure, there's ChatGPT is growing fast and it's very cool that everyone loves using it, but from an economic standpoint, people talking a lot about job displacement. But very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created and what that's going to mean and how people can prepare and upskill for that. And I think that the most exciting thing possible is creating that future of how do humans fit into the economy and how will that evolve over time?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):
I talk to a lot of people about just what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better? People in school right now are just like, "What is even going to be valuable in the future?" You're at the center of a lot of just what jobs are most in demand, how hiring is evolving. So let me just ask you a very concrete question. What jobs do you think will remain in the future/what skills are still worth investing in for younger people, especially?

Brendan Foody (00:20:47):
In terms of jobs, I would respond with a category of things that have very elastic demand are going to be super exciting. Because when we make people 10 times more productive, we'll build 10 times, if not 100 times as much software as an example. And so I think the product managers that can now do so much more are going to be extremely well-positioned. And so far as the skills, I think it's people that can leverage AI to do whatever their day-to-day workflows are.

(00:21:16):
I have had a couple conversations with teachers where they get my thoughts on how they should be assessing their students because we originally started out curating all of these AI interviews and assessments for people and have thought about this immensely. And what we realized is that you don't want to fight against them using the models. It's similar to when the calculator came out, you don't want to give people all of this arithmetic work of how do you get them to do it and not use the calculator. You want to tell them, "Use the tools and let's see what you can do."

(00:21:49):
And so we'll give people interviews where we say, "Use ChatGPT and Kodak. Use Claude code. Use whatever tool cursor and whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour." And so I think that I give that an example in so far as talent assessment because I think it pertains also to the skills that people should be honing in on of how can they leverage this technology to do so much more in whatever industry or vertical they're operating in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:17):
When you talk about elastic, being elastic, is it generalists being good at just a bunch of different things, or what do you say? What do you mean when you think elastic?

Brendan Foody (00:22:25):
So I more mean how much capacity for demand there is in that industry. So I'll give a couple of examples. In accounting, I think realistically we only need so much accounting in the world. Maybe there's areas where we can do more and that'll be good, but it doesn't feel like the world needs 100 times more accounting.

(00:22:46):
On the other hand, in software development, I think we can ship 100 times more features for our products, move 100 times faster, build so much more. There's just it feels like there's unlimited demand for the industry. And I think Mark Andreessen tweeted about this recently, that software is the most elastic industry of all where when we increase productivity, there's so much more that will be built. And it's definitely characteristic of a lot of other domains as well. And so I would focus on those domains where if we make everyone 10 times more productive, that'll increase demand, not reduce it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):
Okay. So you're in the bucket of learn to code, still useful as a skill. You take computer science. And so in terms of elastic categories of jobs, sounds like engineering, product management is in that bucket. Great. A lot of people listening to this are PMs. What else, like design users? I don't know. What else do you feel is in that bucket from what you've seen?

Brendan Foody (00:23:44):
Yeah, I think that there's a lot of things where the whole value chain of building companies has a lot of these variable costs, even large portions of operations or consulting. Imagine if we could have 10 times as many McKinsey consultants, what would be possible in so far as the research we could do, the analysis, et cetera. But I think the companies and people that are going to succeed are those that lean into this narrative of abundance of how do we do so much more rather than fighting back against it of how do we try to stop displacement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):
So along those lines, I think about your second bucket, which is the people that will be most successful. It's not like a specific skill, but it's being good with AI, using AI to become better at what you're already doing. This reminds me of Elon's whole thing with Neuralink, which I don't know if this is how we put it, but the way I've always heard it is you wanted to build Neuralink because in the future when AGI and superintelligence is around, we need a way to compete and the best way to compete is plug our brains into a superintelligence so we have a chance. And it feels like that's what AI is. Getting good at AI tools is essentially is having this super superpower.

Brendan Foody (00:24:58):
Figuring out how to leverage them and incorporate it will definitely be of paramount importance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):
It just comes back to this almost cliche quote now. It's, "AI won't replace you. People that are really good with AI will replace you."

Brendan Foody (00:25:10):
I think it's totally spot on. And I've definitely seen this at the enterprise level as well where there's certain enterprises we talk to that are almost fearful not wanting to engage, not wanting to eval their businesses because that'll provide the evidence that their value chain is being automated. And there's others that... Literally some of the most recognized sophisticated Fortune 500 businesses that have this mentality and there's others that are leaning into it of if we have the ability to do 10 or 100 times more, what will that mean and how do we lean into that future? Because there's so many things that are going to change over the next 10 years, and I think those are the kinds of businesses that are going to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):
Let's talk about labor markets more broadly. You guys, so it's interesting though. You started not feeding people to AI labs, not training models. It was just like help people find jobs, help companies hire, and then you're like, "Oh wow, this whole opportunity." You have this really interesting view on the future of just labor markets and hiring. Talk about that.

Brendan Foody (00:26:14):
Yeah, it's interesting. I remember when we started the company, as I mentioned, we were 19, and just had this gut intuition that it felt so wildly inefficient that labor markets are so disaggregated. And what I mean by that is when we would hire someone internationally, they would apply to a dozen jobs. When we as a company in the Bay Area were considering candidates, we would consider a fraction of a percent of candidates that were available in the market. And the reason for that is that there was this matching problem that everyone's solving manually where they'll manually review resumes, they'll manually conduct interviews, and manually decide who to hire. But when we're able to automate that matching problem at the cost of software, it makes way for this global unified labor market that every candidate applies to and every company hires from facilitating a perfect flow of information in the economy.

(00:27:08):
And I think that that future is undoubtedly what we're heading towards, but what we've realized over time is that the nature of work is also changing dramatically. And part of building that future over a 10-year time horizon is creating that future of work and all of the more tactical things we do and building these incredible data sets across evals and RL environments for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
What I've seen in how hiring has changed, I'm doing research on this with a partner, Gnome, it's so much easier to apply for companies that everyone's just applying now, to hundreds of companies. AI is just making it easy to adjust their resumes and cover letters and make it feel like, "Oh, I applied to more of course very specifically, but it was one of 100 places." And then on the flip side, hiring managers are getting flooded with applications and so now they need AI to filter. So even if we didn't want to get to this place, we're almost being pushed into this direction of so much volume on both sides. We need something really smart at filtering and helping us hire and select, and this is exactly what you guys have been building for a long time.

Brendan Foody (00:28:13):
Precisely, yeah. And the fascinating thing a lot of people ask, do we think about ourselves as a labor marketplace or do we think about ourselves as a data company? And I think that the reason it's an interesting question is our realization on from what the labs need is that they actually need a labor marketplace. They actually need these exceptionally high caliber people. And of course we'll layer on some project management and some software platform associated with it. But the really core thing that they want is how do they find these extraordinary professionals across all of these different domains that can measure model capabilities and work to build that future work together?

(00:29:55):
Going back to just how this all works and what you guys do for models, I was talking to a friend who had an ankle sprain or his foot was hurting and he got an x-ray and he fed the x-ray into ChatGPT and then asked him, "Give me this specific x-ray." And it's like, "Okay, sure." And then it gave him, "Here's what you have." And he was talking to me, he's like, "What is out there on the internet that trained this model to know this stuff?" And I was like, "No, it's actually somebody sitting there helping the model understand this. Once they recognize, it doesn't fully understand this. Humans are actually helping them learn these things."

Brendan Foody (00:30:29):
Exactly. Well, so the way it works, at least what most people's understanding is there's a lot of complexity in how the models work, is that pre-training gets a lot of the knowledge into the model of what are all the different things that see into the world. And then post-training and reinforcement learning is for all of the reasoning of what are the pieces of knowledge that are accurate, what are inaccurate, and what to prioritize at any given time to make a decision. And so behind that, there would've been radiologists that worked on the post-training data set to create some stasis point for here's the diagnosis and rewards and penalties associated with it. And it's really the quality of those people that went into the quality of the decision and recommendation that ChatGPT ultimately made.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
So let's actually follow that, right, because that's really interesting and I don't know how many people understand it. I understand it. So the work that you do and these experts do is post-training. It's not feeding data into the model that it's trained on. It's, "We have this model GPT-5. Now here's all the things that's missing. Let's add to it."

Brendan Foody (00:31:31):
Exactly, yeah. It's really unlocking, allowing the model to focus on all the right tokens, from pre-training all the right things in model context, up weighting the effective reasoning chains to enable the models to reason better in a more generalized way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
What's the scale of people just working on the stuff. It's like thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands?

Brendan Foody (00:31:53):
Tens of thousands at any given time, hundreds of thousands more generally. It's huge. And the most exciting thing is that it's growing really quickly. I think that to your question also about the competitive landscape, historically there were all these crowdsourcing companies that would get these super high volumes of low-skilled people. I think Scale and Surge were the primary companies that pioneered that industry. And then in this transition to higher-skilled labor, what people realized is that actually you can go a lot further with just getting higher caliber people even in smaller amounts initially, and now subsequently scaling that back up once they're able to meet the quality bar.

(00:32:35):
And I think that there's a bunch of companies that after our success and very rapid revenue growth that started early last year have chased after that, which makes sense. And seeing that the market was changing very quickly, we were taking off, and trying to pursue a similar thesis on the market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):
It's interesting. There's always been these companies, AlphaSights and GLG, that did this before AI or is paid to connect to an expert and ask them questions about stuff. And essentially, okay, it turns out this is really useful for models. We don't need the person in the middle.

Brendan Foody (00:33:11):
Exactly, yeah. Well, but one core difference is that AlphaSights would generally be a one-off call versus a lot of our work is really hiring people for projects of how do they work on something for a longer period of time. And so that's, I think, one of the reasons that some of the traditional expert networks have struggled to get into this. And also how do you retain those people and think about all the incentives where it actually looks more similar in some ways to one of the traditional labor marketplaces of an Uber or DoorDash, just with much higher-skilled talent that's treated exceptionally well?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):
It's such a good opportunity for me to learn so much about this, so I'm going to ask questions.

Brendan Foody (00:33:55):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
It's so interesting to me. How much of the experts are focused on specific concrete knowledge versus personality and softer skills? How much of it's like, "Here's how you do an exam. Here's how you do an x-ray"?

Brendan Foody (00:34:09):
It depends on the lab. It's a lot of both. I think that previously it might've been more softer skills, but now a lot of the labs are focused on their business models of what are the economically valuable capabilities that drive revenue and leaning a lot into these professional domains. But I think the creative side is also still really important to everyone. And so we're seeing a meaningful amount of both. We hired all the people from the Harvard Lampoon a couple of months ago, their comedy club, to help with making models funnier. And so do all sorts of stuff like that, hiring Emmy award-winning screenwriters and everything across the board on creative capabilities that you'd look for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):
That is amazing. What a cool story. I'm excited for this to kick in. How fast do these things turn around? Say you hired this team, how fast are we going to see the impact potential? Is like months? Is it years?

Brendan Foody (00:35:03):
Well, so it depends, because some models or some labs will release iteratively where they'll just improve the model behind the scenes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:11):
Without announcing a new model?

Brendan Foody (00:35:12):
Exactly. Every couple of weeks versus others do these big releases. And so it depends a lot. We're behind all of them, but we move really fast. It would be a customer gives us a request of we need these award-winning screenwriters, and within 24 hours we'll turn around the experts. And then there's also this really interesting dynamic where in a set of 100 people that we hire, oftentimes the top 10% of people will drive majority of the model improvement. It's like a company. If you have 100-person company, oftentimes the top 10% of the company will drive majority of the impact. And what that means is that when we're able to build proprietary advantages in identifying who are those top 10% of people, both in so far as how do we have them on our platform but also identify and match them effectively, it creates so much value for customers that it's difficult to compete against.

(00:36:08):
And so it really does tie back to the founding thesis of the company, which is how do we find these extraordinary people and identify them so that we can reliably deliver these top 10% or top 10X experiences for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:25):
So on that, so is the idea, you hire Jane. She's incredible at coding and she now works for Anthropic and that's her full-time job doing this? Or is this a part-time thing? Is this a project thing mostly?

Brendan Foody (00:36:38):
It would sometimes be part-time. Sometimes it would be full-time. I would say most often it's part-time where it's like someone might work at a thing company where they're underemployed, maybe one of the ones that's moving slower where they have an extra 20 hours a week and then they're able to do this on the side or whatever the equivalent is across a bunch of different industries. But we also do a lot of 40 hour a week roles as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):
And how much are they making? Is it meaningful enough for a AI engineer to spend time on this?

Brendan Foody (00:37:13):
Yeah, very meaningful. So our median pay rate in the marketplace is $95 an hour, but it can flex up, well up into $500 an hour based on the depth of someone's expertise. And one thing that highlights this difference relative to a lot of the crowdsourcing companies is if you look at the economics of the crowdsourcing companies, oftentimes they would pay $30 an hour to town as the average. And so think about the people that you can hire, the undergrads for $30 now versus the Goldman bankers, the McKinsey analysts, the Fang software engineers. And ultimately it comes down to what are the capabilities that labs want their models to have? And it much more falls in the latter bucket than the former one.

# Brian Chesky’s new playbook

## Transcript

Brian Chesky (00:00:00):
Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Today my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years, and my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. This is a very special episode for me and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:17):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:03:06):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

(00:05:00):
Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brian Chesky (00:05:04):
Well, thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:06):
Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you would be on my podcast?

Brian Chesky (00:05:12):
I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such a successful podcast. But yeah, congrats on everything. This is awesome.

Lenny (00:05:18):
I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at Figma Config and a lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb, and I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. And they were trying to decide should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? So I'm just curious to hear from you, what is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?

Brian Chesky (00:05:56):
I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off-stage. I saw somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function and all the designers in the room started cheering. So I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant, because I didn't actually get rid of the people. And also why did the people in the room cheer? Because that's also a thing we should ask ourselves. And I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did that place come from, that 5,000 designers in a room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function? Because if I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would've cheered. It was specifically that function. So I want to talk about what that might mean. It wasn't the people, it's the way they're working together.

(00:06:46):
So we don't have any longer the traditional product management function as it existed when you was here. But we didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. So we actually started off boarding some responsibilities to program management. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. So we don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. So the most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product.

(00:07:42):
So the basic idea is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it. And a lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, it doesn't work, and they say, "We tried that. It didn't work." And if you say you tried and it didn't work, my question is, was it a bad product, a bad strategy or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product? So that is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence. They do not have control.

(00:08:31):
Now you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? Because I want to say ... I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.

(00:09:09):
I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know ... Heads of design. Well-known heads of design. I told them they're not designers, they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization. Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization. Like design is catching things before it goes out the door. It's not actually typically part of the development process. And I think this is not just bad for design, it's bad for product managers and engineers because we all want to build the best products. And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomenon might have happened. And if people are watching this from a large company, here might be some of the characteristics.

(00:09:43):
The first thing you notice is that these different groups might be running on slightly different technical stacks. That's the first problem. And they may actually be accumulating technical debt. The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies. So five teams are going different directions, but they all need a payment platform. And so what happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block. And then at some point they just give up. So then the teams that are dependent on other people say, "Give me the resources and I'll build this group myself." So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign or to leverage some service, they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups. So now they're really becoming separate divisions. And this is where a division comes from.

(00:10:34):
Now, once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority. So now you have to advocate for your division. So there's a lot of advocacy. If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships. And so the people that are liked that build the best relationships are the ones that get the most resources and that creates what we call politics. And so now politics that brood in the company. And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided. And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what. People are going in different directions and that creates a lack of accountability. When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter and that creates complacency. And then suddenly a fast-growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy. This is a general arc that winds up happening.

(00:11:30):
And then you end up having this situation where a company's done 10 marketing efforts, but no customer's heard anything. They have thousands of engineers, they shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did. Marketing and engineering don't talk to each other. It's not even they hate each other, they're in different universes. I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close is engineering and marketing? And marketing is at lot of companies are like the waiters, engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters and they go in the kitchen. In fact, the waiters are the ones talking to the customers all day and they also know how to sell things so you really want them being enjoined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.

(00:12:17):
So this is the problem that we had. And also the other thing we were doing is, as you know Lenny, we were spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually my co-founder who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marking is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is. But if you do need to laser in and balance supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing though doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want an arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits.

(00:13:23):
So a lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy. Product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously we did one today we can talk about.

(00:14:26):
The entire company works together. They row in the same direction. And the product management also does the product marketing. So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there.

Lenny (00:15:24):
That was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about. So I'm going to-

Brian Chesky (00:15:27):
Oh, gee. So we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deep.

Lenny (00:15:31):
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single roadmap you talked about. And what this reminds me of is I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a public company and he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build, and then over time they're encouraged to delegate and to empower and it leads to a bunch of optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics. And then eventually you realize I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.

Brian Chesky (00:16:08):
That's exactly how it went, and that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of. By the way, I think that many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to step away and delegate their product to other people, but suddenly they've delegated away the thing they're best at. The thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief product officer title, but if we had one, it would be me. I wouldn't have a chief product officer. I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech company. If the CEO is not the chief product officer then I don't know if they're a product or tech led company. Maybe that's okay if they're an ops company or if they're a marketing company or if they're not a tech company at all. But ultimately I think the founder or CEO should be that person.

(00:16:59):
So when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us. As you know, I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did ops, I did a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product.

(00:17:27):
And I always remember Lenny there was this paradox where the less involved I was in a project ... Let me be clear. There were times I inserted myself and dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And that was just a learning experience for me. But there was this other scenario where the less involved I was in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved. And the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Because people assume that our natural equilibrium's to move fast so if we're moving slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership and therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for initially, they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always, it seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster so I'd empower them and move slower.

(00:18:26):
And again, how that happened is what I described. That you end up in a situation where you're delegating down. So I think that things were getting worse and slower and slower and slower. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. And by 2019 we were spending a billion dollars on AdWords. We weren't really investing in the brand. We were doing a huge amount of AB testing. I think AB testing is important in times. Actually, let me clarify AB testing. We don't test blue versus green. We have a control and a treatment like I think we did when you were here. So we have a design. We might do a holdback occasionally to see how the thing is working. But if we do an AB test, there has to be a hypothesis. If we don't have a hypothesis and A is better than B, then we're stuck with B. And that's a really, really big problem, but we can never change it.

(00:19:27):
And then imagine 10 teams doing AB testing. Imagine if you designed software the way you designed a house or design a house the way design software. And we AB test a sofa. And we said, well, how does this sofa work? And it seems like with this sofa that we've AB tested people spend more time in the living room, so therefore people are going to like this room better. But actually the sofa has a relationship to the end stands which have a relationship to the lamps which have a relationship to the carpet or the rug which have a relationship to the television which have a relationship to the house and everything else. So you have to think about the whole cohesive system. And I started realizing that. I asked one person on your team, somebody you know well, and I asked him, I said, "I feel like I open our app and the product hasn't changed and four years." I remember saying this, 2018, 2019. And this person described that you know well as just the way we were doing things. The initial way we were doing things to move fast had made us move slow.

(00:20:29):
So what we ended up doing is ... It was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems to not change, costs are rising. I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics. By politics I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole company. More bureaucracy meaning meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio a week. And I didn't really quite know what to do.

(00:21:03):
And then right before the pandemic, I meet two people that really affected how I thought about things. The first was Hiroki Asai. Hiroki now works at Airbnb. He's one of my executives and actually product design, product marketing design and marketing report into him. And he was a creative director for Apple. So he worked for Steve Jobs, was basically dotted line to Steve for many, many years. Came from graphic design. Eventually ran all of marketing communications. In Apple Marketing Communications, they actually designed the app. They made the app. They designed all the marketing touchpoints for the store. So it wasn't just ads, it was every brand touchpoint they were responsible. So everything flowed through marketing. And so marketing became the governing factor that made everything really organized.

(00:21:52):
I met another person or got reacquainted a person named Jony Ive. And Jony Ive was the head of industrial design and Chief Design Officer at Apple. And they described this way of running a company that was totally different than the way that I was running it. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs it this way today, but the services is turning into a division and they are just so big that I think it's not a one-to-one anymore, but they are still technically run this way. And I had this image of not being divisional because we were running ... We had 10 divisions. We had a flights division and we had a homes division which was divided to pro hosts and core hosts and lux and we had business travel and we had a magazine and we had experiences and we had .org and we had China. So we had these 10 different divisions all going in 10 different directions. And I created this culture where everyone would be a business manager or business leader, general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. And so the company kept getting subdivided, subdivided, subdivided and that made it very, very difficult to turn.

(00:22:57):
And this was all about me delegating responsibility. The problem is if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-led founder ... What are you doing? Strategy, capital allocation. My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things. I was in a lot of meetings. Trying to adjudicate different issues between groups. So then the pandemic occurs and I had this image on mind. It's like I have this dream that I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe and Nate in Bolinas. It was October 2019. And I told them I had this dream that I left the company 10 years ago and they just asked me to come back. And I said, "I was horrified at what I found." And they said, "Well, what'd you find?" I said, "I found a company that on the one hand had amazing culture and people with a great mission, with a brand people really loved, but we lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the longterm. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and cost was rising and growth was slowing." And that was exactly what was happening.

(00:24:20):
And then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God. I remember basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near-death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your life flashes before your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near-death business experience and our business flashed before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back involved in the details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing. Before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, what do we do? We need you more involved. And so I got more involved.

(00:25:05):
And when I got involved, I made the following changes. The first thing I did is I said, everything we're doing has to be written down and put into a Google sheet. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, "We're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document." I'm like, "What?" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things. And so if everyone says, "Oh, Airbnb is simple. I'm only doing three things." Yes, but you're one of a thousand people. So actually we're doing 3000 things. So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of the team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup.

(00:25:54):
So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product which turned to product marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. As a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big, it's just say that's how small we are and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.

(00:26:28):
So we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist. Or there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Jony did. They're interchangeable. I could never imagine Jony out at Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true. So people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.

(00:27:11):
I stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. So we're going to have a roadmap. It's going to be a two-year roadmap. We'll update the roadmap literally every month. People may wonder, well, what if the world changes? Yeah, it changes every day. So the roadmap's something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out it changes. It's a rolling roadmap. And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We house 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there's always unexpected events.

(00:27:54):
I created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I made the group much smaller. I took a lot of product managers, I reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained in actual program management because their roles got much bigger. Program management at Airbnb is a high status job. A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. At Airbnb we said because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We said we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects have to be on the roadmap. And then I'm going to review all the work. And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said I'm getting back involved in the project and I'm going to review all the product and all the marketing. So every project I would review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks or every 12 weeks. There'd be a cadence.

(00:28:46):
And then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship. Whether we thought they were work, we don't know until after we ship it. But I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, "Why isn't this happening?" And we would all get together. And so you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. It would be like I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.

(00:29:25):
Because imagine if we're a car company and I see the car prototype every week and I notice there's something about the tires off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. So every week I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify with teams the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace. And so because we had all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate people going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. So these were some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Wieden+Kennedy or ChiatDay or any of those anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.

(00:30:32):
The creative group does not just the ads but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. And writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing. Unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes.

(00:31:16):
Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there because they might not always be there.

(00:32:17):
I basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement, and I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

Lenny (00:32:57):

(00:34:15):
You guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways, in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them. Paid growth and maybe SEO, maybe referrals at least for a while. And you've shifted to let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. And our bet is that's going to grow. Do you feel like this can work for most other products or is there a consumer specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this?

Brian Chesky (00:34:53):
I think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion and we will do some experiments. Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passes. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field, and a lot of companies that do 80% running down the ball down the field and 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone.

(00:35:33):
Here are the things I believe. I'll give you a checklist. Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as this chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they really are running separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain. Because you can't manage people devoid of their work.

(00:36:18):
Imagine a fire chief and they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want hold the product back. I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Eames that said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness, it comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason or the product person is a designer.

(00:37:25):
I would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution. Understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.

(00:38:18):
I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. And you should think of your company in a five or 10 years story. You may not know where you are in 10 years, but you're telling this ongoing story. And most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, actually I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?

Lenny (00:38:48):
Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it. Your winter release. And it is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.

Brian Chesky (00:39:00):
Let me just back up Lenny. You know this problem really well. One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together and we have all this unique inventory and people list it on Airbnb. And every home is one of a kind and we have seven million homes and there's all this surprise and all this delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're going to get. And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth. Where when you open the door you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. And when we survey guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one ... Hotels are not as special, they're not as unique, but the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.

(00:39:56):
And so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's achilles heel, or at least it has been. That with hotels you know what you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know what you're going to get. And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets, plus all the host cancellation data and we use all the signal to create the top two million homes. This collection of two million homes that we call Guest Favorites because the guests rate the highest. We think combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with a reliability you've come to expect in a hotel and I can't imagine there's a lot of use cases where you wouldn't want to book a Guest Favorite.

(00:40:50):
We think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. You see, as you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale through living together certainly. And we felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade. So we obviously made some upgrades to ratings and reviews. The final thing, and this brings up another point I might bring up, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is accurate. But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. So they might not describe perfectly their listing, they might not have filled up their amenities, they might not have a photo tour. And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage their listing. And it was hard to manage their listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.

(00:41:47):
Oh, here's the other thing, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and host team. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team. The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guest and host. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions that become incompatible. So we have product marketers that are responsible for guests and host things, but the designers and the engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project.

(00:42:25):
And then we keep some people, especially the product marketing people on a domain area, but we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface. And so that's what we did. We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed. It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we ever designed. If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of the design we've done. By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic. I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather, but I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.

(00:43:24):
I think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment. Light, texture. I think it's more intuitive, it's more playful. I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces. People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more dimension to it. And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic that I think it's going to be where a lot of interface design is going. And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer visioning language that we trained on 100 million photos and it can basically scan all your photos and organize them by room. So that's what we did today. Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would've been possible in the old way of working. We could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but really getting them to work together has been key. And Guest Favorites has required the guests, people ... You have to work with guests, you have to work with hosts, you have to essentially ... You have to figure out how to communicate to the market. So it's a much more integrated approach.

Lenny (00:44:41):
The designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute. You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures on it. It is really cool. Also, the listing tab. I think people that aren't hosts don't understand how important the listing experience is to a host. How many hosts are there? Seven million? Something like that?

Brian Chesky (00:45:00):
There's seven million listings. Over seven million listings.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Yeah. And so that's the home base. That's like the small business platform for millions of people. And so I worked on the host sites. I have a special place in my heart for host features, and I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.

Brian Chesky (00:45:18):
Well, yeah, you did some amazing work there. Yeah. The big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to create a great guest experience, you need great hosts, and to have great hosts, they need great tools. And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with building great tools for hosts to enable them to provide a great experience for guests. And so that was one of the theories behind the listing tab is we're going to build great tools for hosts. They're going to love it. And we also felt like if we put care in the design of our app, that hosts are going to see that and that they're going to actually put care into hosting. Even more than they already do. And they do put a lot of care in now.

Lenny (00:45:55):
Speaking of great products, a defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think. How you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you is in meetings, we present our goal and you're always saying, "How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?" And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10X'd them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?

Brian Chesky (00:46:32):
As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero. Add a zero at the end, which is to imagine something you order, imagine it bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently. And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10X scale or 10X better or 10X faster where you can't do the current process to do it. You have to think differently about the problem. And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem. And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.

(00:47:22):
And we might call this first principle thinking. What are the foundational elements that comprise this problem and how can we reconstruct them? So the first thing is I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams, that helps them understand a problem. The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do. And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, "Okay, let's circle back on this next week." No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Okay, let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, how do we do this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.

(00:48:18):
But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think, in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once ... I'm going to paraphrase what he said. What is your secret to success? And he said, "That I just asked my players to do their very best." And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.

(00:49:04):
When I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying, you're not good enough, or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me. So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you, and I know that you have more in you. And the way to know if a team could do better is if they're life dependent on it, could they do it? And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. And motivation is if they're life ... Not literally dependent on it, but if it was a crisis or if it was a defining moment in their lives. I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death, that's too far, but to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves, and to really push them. To set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving, soul crushing bureaucracies.

Lenny (00:50:06):
I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. And so I've seen that myself. With some of the things you've talked about of say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back and this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and also all these launches, it sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?

Brian Chesky (00:50:34):
First of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly now, the more I get involved ... This is so weird. The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox. And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense. But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything, we would do endless edits of even the press release, it would seem like I would be working 80, 100 hours a week and that people will be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. And I got just the opposite. Here's what I found. If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.

(00:51:20):
And so for one to two years it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted them to do if I wasn't there. And by the way, that's what the culture is. They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room. And so that became our culture. Suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company. There was less turnover. People were rowing in the same direction. That I wasn't reacting. Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction and by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time on my hands initially, and now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.

(00:52:33):
But to answer your question on burnout, I think is another very good question. I do not think I am the poster child, at least historically, of work-life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would've thought the inverse. That I'd have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you need ... Let's say an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives, slower and slower.

(00:53:13):
And so I basically have tried to make it a practice to step away from the work. And so here's some of the things I do. Every other weekend I don't really work at all. And then every other weekend I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend I'd work more intensely. You wouldn't be a parent every other weekend, but I'm not so it's a little different. I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout. So I usually wake up, I'll do 20 minutes of morning cardio on a Peloton. I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights. I'll basically do cardio just about every day. I make sure that I eat really healthy. I have a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. So I try to make sure I do that. I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.

(00:54:01):
The other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important things that will govern how happy you are in your life is your relationships. I think the three things are your health, your relationships, and your work. Those are probably the three most important things. So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships. And there was this Harvard study. It's the longest study on human happiness. I think it's 85 years old. And the question was, what's the secret of happiness? And of course they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one. And the answer was, the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships. And I had found, Lenny, that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn't have friends. I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them. And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them. And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with, including old friends.

(00:55:03):
So I have a group of high school friends, we have a group chat and we take one to two trips together a year. I have a group of college friends, we have a group chat. We take probably a couple trips together a year. By the way, doing Airbnbs are great. We all get in a house together and it's like your opportunity to have a shared experience. And if you don't travel with your old friends, you'll have only old stories to talk about and then you say the same old stories over and over. So you want to be able to have new shared experiences. When I stay here in New York City ... I'm in New York right now. That's why you don't see my typical background. I stay in my sister's apartment. So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her. And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends. And of course we travel. Traveling is what I do with a lot of my friends. And then I like to draw and read. So I try to make sure it's health, work and relationships. And I try to make sure I have a balance of each. And you might call family relationships. I'm single, but that would be another version of it.

Lenny (00:56:02):
I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you're really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone and they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy.

Brian Chesky (00:56:12):
In the old world, I was reacting, so everyone thought I was busy. So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, "Well, he's busy so he'll reach out to me when he's not busy." But here's a problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now that was a mistake. But I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders. A lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll respond to emails, and suddenly their email sets the agenda. People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them. Versus here's my strategy and then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to be able to execute this strategy?

(00:57:05):
If my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would've wanted to make sure I spent time with? And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's possible, it would completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work, but they don't actually move the ball down the field. And I really try to say yes to the work that's very meaningful and people that are very meaningful to me. So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, but it's true of companies too. You can sometimes be ... You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. You do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Just one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run. If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs, you've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale and just to take on this leadership role? Is it coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.

Brian Chesky (00:58:46):
You ask really good questions. And by the way, thank you. I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner, and I told him, "I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet." And he was really surprised. He's like, "What are you talking about?" And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion, but I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel worthy. But I have this beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's a weird feeling. I think when I first took off, I think I thought I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak or you go into this trough where you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.

(00:59:49):
And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. Pablo Picasso had a saying. He said, "It took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child." And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity. To see everything with fresh eyes. To not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure how to run the company, I studied the history of divisional organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied what Bill Gates did. And I studied Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont. They were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do we do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels so they created what we now know as the divisional structure.

(01:00:46):
So I try to understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives, or one of the biggest honor is when other people ask them for help. Because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It gives a lot of them great honor. And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows the latest distribution channels that I have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning, it's growing, it's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better. To feel like I haven't made it yet. Because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. And I want to feel like an artist. Bob Dylan used to say, "An artist has to be in a constant place of becoming and so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay."

(01:02:05):
And so you have to always be evolving, learning, growing, and the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started and I hope that ... I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intend to do this for a long time and if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said I still believe, but if 100% of what I say, I still believe then I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say I don't believe anymore than I'm delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that? By being curious.

Lenny (01:02:59):
That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple of weeks ago that I'll read real quick. "Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in hours of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, et cetera." How does that feel to have seen that?

Brian Chesky (01:03:23):
I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say I think Sam is obviously a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched ChatGPT I had known him for a real long period of time, and I knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and then research part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales. So there were all these other functional responsibilities. And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary ... And he would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.

(01:04:13):
Before Y Combinator, there was a person named Michael Seibel. He's in Y Combinator. And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. And I asked him, I said, "How do I repay you?" And he said, "Well, I want you to pass this on to other founders." And I would meet with a lot of people in the valley, and there was just this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win if the ecosystem was healthy. And the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another. And you pay it forward. I think that it's just one continuation of the valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.

Lenny (01:05:03):
Final question. When someone joins Airbnb, there's a very longstanding tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.

Brian Chesky (01:05:18):
Yeah. A fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. When I was five years old I remember my parents take me to the Norman Rockwell museum and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings I should say. I shouldn't even call them illustrations. And I would try to reproduce them. And I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them. When I got older, one of my friends, I went to his house ... I'm going to say I was eight or nine years old. And his dad was basically redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe he was an architect. So he had this giant dining room table, and he had this vellum paper and he had a T-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor. They were really cool looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings.

(01:06:15):
So I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture. I went to RPI when I was in freshman year of high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing. Then I got into a film and animation. Then I got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This is when the internet was nascent and people still mailed the annual reports. As so I got my dad to buy a few shares at some Disney stock. And I got these renderings and he had a report of theme parks. And I started drawing and designing theme parks in communities.

(01:07:00):
And I was at this private school actually for hockey. Because I had this life where I was playing ice hockey and I thought I was going to play college hockey. My dad was really into it. I was really into it. And I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact. I basically went to a military high school.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Wow. I did not know that.

Brian Chesky (01:07:22):
And at this military sports academy oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade. And that's not a good thing, by the way. I don't say it as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. And so I leave this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey. And I transferred to my public high school late my junior year. And imagine transferring to a new public high school late junior year. And I meet my art teacher who changes my life. Her name is Ms. Williams, and she sees my artwork. And by the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me, "I chose a job for the love, and I got paid no money. So you should choose a job that pays you a lot of money." And I said to my mom, "One day, I'm going to be an artist." She said, "Oh my God, you chose the only job where you're going to paid less than a social worker." So I think my parents, they were supportive of me going to art, but they were very nervous. And then Ms. Williams told my mom, she said, "Don't worry. He's going to be a famous artist one day." I wasn't going to become a famous artist. But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art.

(01:08:31):
I ended up being a winner, there were multiple winners, of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design where I ended up going to RISD. It's like MIT for design or whatever. It's a prestigious art and design school. But I got to RISD and I realized I was born 100 years too late for what I wanted to do, which is draw and paint. And I felt like at that point, photography and now AI generated art, but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. And that's when I was in my freshman year of college and I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.

(01:09:26):
And really, Lenny, maybe just to round out the story, because that was a fun fact, but I'm just ... And this is the pre founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designer is different than a graphic designer. Because an industrial designer, you have to work with engineering in your training. I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers. You have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design's very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design an office building and the office building doesn't get leased, the architect's usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product, it doesn't sell, you're on the hook for it. At least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you had to understand marketing and strategy.

(01:10:11):
And so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. And the day of graduation Joe looks to me, he says, "Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day." And I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles where I work as an industrial designer for two years when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package and it's a seat cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, "I started a company and everyone in San Francisco ... I live in San Francisco and all these people are starting companies. You should come here." And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I had seen all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I'd never heard his voice before YouTube. And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.

(01:11:18):
And so one day I go into work and I quit my job. My boss is dumbfounded. And I pack everything in the backseat of old Honda Civic. I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay our rent. This design conference is coming to San Francisco. All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference? I didn't have any beds, but Joe had beds and we called it Air Bed and Breakfast.

(01:11:45):
So my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb. Really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different. Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity, I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head and they're disembodied from their heart, and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think that some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded way of thinking about the world is good. So anyways, that's my final thought.

## Transcript

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:00):
Warren Buffett famously said, in business.

Audio (00:00:02):
I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats.

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:04):
Power requires a benefit and a barrier, so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle, you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
So in a lot of decks it's like, "Oh, we have the most amazing team. We move the fastest." You mention how rarely is that actually a power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:20):
You're on a treadmill and if you stop running on that treadmill, you get creamed, but it's not power. The things that drive operational excellence can be mimicked.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
Let's actually talk about achieving these powers.

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:32):
There's a thing called power progression. There are times when certain types of power are available. The path to power is where the rubber meets the road.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
Today my guest is Hamilton Helmer. Hamilton is a legend in the world of strategy. He's the author of 7 Powers, which outlines a framework for identifying and developing sustainable competitive advantage. It is widely considered to be the best book on strategy and people like Patrick Carlson, Peter Thiel, Reed Hastings, Daniel Eck, and so many more leaders credit the book and Hamilton's teachings for helping them build durable lasting companies. In our conversation, Hamilton shares what sources of power startups can start developing early, which types of power companies often think they have but they don't, how power relates to strategy and moats, when to start thinking about power as a startup and also what individual product managers and non-leaders can do about these insights about power. Also, how Hamilton sees AI impacting various entry and the sources of power. He also gives a preview of his new book that he's working on currently and so much more.

Hamilton Helmer (00:04:12):
Hi Lenny, a pleasure to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:14):
It's even more my pleasure. I want to start by talking about when power becomes important. When do you recommend founders start thinking about power in terms of pre-product market fit, post-product market fit? Is it worth spending time thinking about power early? Obviously it's good to think about a little bit, but how much and how seriously should founders be thinking about it before they found something that people actually want?

Hamilton Helmer (00:04:38):
One of the things that has really surprised me in the last five years has been that my understanding of the answer to that question has changed. And before I thought it was you do product market fit and then you do strategy, and if you try and put strategy before product market fit, it is not much you can do with it. That's wrong. Actually, I mentioned before one of the great pleasures for me in my work is being able to talk to company founders and one of the things that has surprised me is that conversations with them, even at an early stage about strategic matters have a richness and relevance to me that was unexpected.

(00:05:41):
And founders are practical people. I mean it's very hard to do what they're doing and they have to be extremely focused and choose what's worthwhile spending time on. And so in observing their reactions and that dialogue, I could see that there was something going on that was meaningful to them. And this second book we're working on, we'll tease out why that's so more, but the answer to your question is when should you thinking about this? The answer is always. And that's an odd answer. And so even before you have product-market fit, it's worth thinking about strategy. Now it's not strategy in the sense of this fully articulated strategic planning, we're going to do this, these are going to be the competitors, this is how we're going to answer them. This is how we'll price. Not like that at all. At the earlier stage, you can imagine wildly more degrees of freedom and the questions are of the business propositions that you're thinking of in trying to get to product-market fit, what are the underlying characteristics that might tilt them towards the availability of power or not?

(00:07:10):
And those actually are meaningful conversations and certainly by no means certain. You're tilting probabilities, you're not creating a determinative things. And then later on, once you've already have product-market fit, then you have to understand your source of power to understand what competitive position is because then you have to establish that. And then later on in a more stable phase when you're in a stability phase of business, you have to know what your source of power is if you have one, because you have to know how to defend it. And then also it is also the foundational knowledge that you need for if there's another step. Because another thing that's quite surprising about iconic businesses is they often have a second act or a third act or fourth act. I mean think of AWS or Intel going into CPUs or Apple going into iPhones, all not the origin of business. And that's actually common, not unusual, and that's starting the process all over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:24):
Awesome. You mentioned this word strategy. I want to set a little foundation here. How does strategy relate to power when people are thinking about these two concepts? And then do you have just a nice definition of what strategy is? Everyone's always just like, "What the heck do you mean when you're talking about the strategy?"

Hamilton Helmer (00:08:41):
As I said, I'm a concept person and so when you develop concepts, you have to be very highly constrained by their usefulness. I'm a great fan of the great mathematician, John von Neumann, and he had a view which really irritated a lot of mathematicians, which is that if mathematics wasn't guided by what was useful, it would become, I think the word he used was aesthetic to aesthetic. And so any concept developments like that, it needs to be guided by usefulness. And so in dealing with strategy, the question is what domain of things do you want to include in that conversation? Because the term is ubiquitous in business. I mean do a Google search sometime. I've done one recently on Google Scholar for the word strategy and you'll get a million, I'm not exaggerating, a million hits. And so strategy for some people might mean everything that gets to the pile, it gets to the top of a pile in terms of what you have to do that year.

(00:09:58):
Everything is... And that's a perfectly legitimate definition, but what I have found is that there is a very important narrowing that makes it much more useful. So that's coming back to what I was saying [inaudible 00:10:17] makes it much more useful to the business. So my view is that you want to focus, it's very useful for a business to focus on the fundamental determinants of business value and that's an arbitrary choice. It could be something else, but I can tell you from decades of business experience that that narrowing is very useful. And then so once you make that... Once you reach that understanding, it tells you some important things. So if you understand what drives business value, I mean if you do the math of it right, it's NPV of cash flow, right? Expected cash flow. And what that tells you is that strategy is a long time concept. You're looking far out in the future.

(00:11:10):
So think of Pearl Harbor, Pearl Harbor for the Japanese was this enormous tactical success. They just destroyed the US ability, naval ability in the Pacific Ocean and the worst possible strategic move because it completely solved Franklin Delano Roosevelt's problem of how he could get the US citizens on board to attacking Hitler. The strategy of it was US's industrial might would eventually win the war and population. And the difference there is time constant, tactical short, strategy long. And so if you focus on value that narrows what you think about and allows you to get rather concise and offer up advice to founders about what they need to pay attention to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
So then how specifically is power informing strategies? Like the way you think about it, focus on your power and that will inform your strategy?

Hamilton Helmer (00:12:17):
Earlier I talked about these economic structures that provide durability of return in terms of refuge from withering arbitrage of everybody who wants to eat your lunch. And so that's what power is. So you have to understand what is an economics? You're asking me questions that get pretty deep into theory or I hope you don't, this is too conceptual. But you have to say, you have to understand how competition takes place and say what is it that creates some kind of refuge? And what it is is there's something in what you do that gives you either a cost or price advantage over others. So let's say you're lower cost and that's the benefit. And the barrier side is that there's something that is durable about that that makes it over time that you can't, the competitors can't take away from you. So benefit and a barrier, we call it the to be or not to be test. And if you have that, you can think of that immediately translating into a value because that will give you good margins out into the foreseeable future, which is what you're after.

(00:13:44):
I don't know if that's... We're getting into the weeds here, but that's what it's about. And so power is those structures. Let me give you a quick example. So one I use in the book. So Netflix with scale economies, they have more subscribers. The cost of their content is a very large fixed cost, about 50% of their cost structure every year. They can take that fixed cost and spread it over more subscribers so their cost per subscriber is less versus somebody with fewer subscribers. So if they face the same prices for subscriptions as their competitors, they will be more profitable. And that's a scale economy and that's an example of a type of power and a common one I'd say. But these things are hard to achieve, right? Because there's the holy grail.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:47):
So let's actually talk about achieving these powers. Essentially the argument here is your power informs everything you do because this is the thing that'll allow you to stay durable and competitive and last. There's seven powers. We're not going to talk about all of them. If you want to go understand each of them, go read the book.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:07):
Yeah. Let's not. That conversation always goes too long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Yeah, exactly. So what I'm wondering is, okay, so say you're looking at this list of seven powers and you're a specific type of startup, do you have a heuristic that tells you here's most likely the power and set of subsets that will most likely be an option for you? Like B2B SaaS companies, is there a smaller subset? Probably one of these has to be one of your options versus B2C.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:32):
That's a great question Lenny, because I think the path to power is where the rubber meets the road and it's very complicated and nuanced. But I'll give you a few thoughts along it and frankly our next book, the Second Invention, that's what it's about. It's about power, the entire book.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
[Inaudible 00:15:56] I'll try to read it.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:58):
So in a book there's a thing called power progression, which says there are... It tells over the cycle of a business, there are times when certain types of power are available and the converse of that is times when they're not available. And so there's some that only are really available in when you reach a stability phase of a business pretty far out there.

(00:16:25):
And so if you're starting a company, take those off the table. So those two are branding and process power. So often I find that there's a confusion about this because brand recognition for a startup may be incredibly important, but you can get brand recognition by buying an ad in the Super Bowl. That's not power, that you paid for it. So take branding and process power and process power is really operational excellence on steroids and usually is imitable, so it's usually not.

(00:17:05):
So take those off the table and then a resource type of power, which is you have something that is of value that if you transferred it to somebody else it would be of value to them, but you own the rights. So the barrier is law for example, or lack of knowledge from others. And there are classes of businesses that are like that. So prescription pharmaceuticals, if you are the first person to come up with Viagra, that's worth a lot of money. If you took that license and gave it to somebody else, it'd be worth a lot of money to them. But that's a different class and it's usually not the types of things that I'm dealing with and it's obvious to everybody. So the key challenge there is can you invent a pharmaceutical that's effective for a large market. So you can take those three off the table and that then leaves counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs and network economies.

(00:18:13):
And the important thing to keep in mind there is that they're sequenced. So almost every startup that you want to deal with starts with counter positioning because remember what product market fit is primarily is a substitution. You are coming up with a way to satisfy a more or less existing need in a novel way that creates more value. Now sometimes you tap into entirely new needs, but it's not so often. I mean Amazon was up against brick and mortar stores, Google was up against Yahoo and so on, and so you're usually substituting and that substitution, so your competition at that point is functional competition.

(00:19:19):
And if you don't have counter positioning at that point you're pretty high risk from an incumbent who already has the capabilities necessary to do that. They just have to extend their product or do this or that, but counter positioning is the refuge from that. And then you go into the other three types of power scale economies, switching costs and network economies, and those depend on your scale relative to competitors. This is pretty cursory, but that's what I'd say. I'll focus on those four and I would recommend that you think pretty hard about whether you think you have counter positioning to start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:08):
Awesome. I actually want to double down on that thread, but just to summarize, I have the list here. Basically you're saying if you're an early stage startup, the four to really that are actually potential powers for you at least early on, counter positioning, which your point is you could just start with that. That's essentially positioning and business model design, which happens at the beginning and then you can start to think about network economy, scale economy, switching costs as powers.

Hamilton Helmer (00:20:33):
Right. And you've done the right thing by not having me go through and define each of those. But your listeners will need to go back to my book and see what those things are to get... We're going through the shorthand as we should, but all of what we've said won't be completely obvious to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:54):
Yeah, I think a simple Google search I find just gives you a very simple definition of these.

Hamilton Helmer (00:20:58):
Yeah, that's right. There's some people who have done some really good summaries of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
Or ChatGPT, even better in a lot of cases.

Hamilton Helmer (00:21:05):
ChatGPT if they get it right sometimes I find they hallucinate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Hallucinate an eighth power. You mentioned how some companies think they have a certain power or it's common to think you have a certain power. If you look at every startup deck, there's always like, "Here's our moat, here's the way we're going to have barriers to entry." I'm guessing in almost every case they're delusional about the power that they actually have and the power they think they'll have. Do you also find that to be true that often founders are wrong about how much barrier they've actually created and is there a power you often find most wrong and mistaken?

Hamilton Helmer (00:21:43):
Yeah, so I agree with your observation, but I don't want to be unkind. So I mean there are two things to keep in mind here in terms of making people feel better about that incorrect slide in the deck. One is that founders have to be optimistic. I think it's an important quality that they maybe understate the risk a little bit, but they're so committed to I'm going to do this thing that they go through that and that may give them an advantage over a large corporation trying to do the same thing. The other is that despite the name 7 Powers, which makes it sound like, oh, you can sort this out. Actually understanding whether or not there is a type of power in place is hard. I mean I did it with my colleagues here at Strategy Capital and we're looking at a well-known company, it might take us weeks to answer that question for a single company.

(00:22:47):
And it comes down to the hard part is industry economics is what really are the economic relationships and it's very hard. So with those caveats that... Give them some courtesy, I'll say some of the obvious ones are I mentioned before, people sometimes think they have branding power, but another one that I think I've heard you mention is people often think that they get scale economies through data. And I'd say that that's possible, but it's rare. And the reason it's rare is not because there aren't scale economies in data, but rather that the range of scale that the existing competitors have are often large enough to be able to put them in shouting distance of each so that the differences in their cost per unit is not that great.

(00:23:50):
The curve flattens in other words, which is typical of any, because the most common scale economy is you've got a big fixed cost and you prorate that. And as you get more and more scale, the percentage cost advantage of a fixed cost advantage like that goes down and that often. So that's a pretty frequent one that we see. We laugh whenever we hear somebody say they have a flywheel, which gives you the idea of network economies. There are often flywheels, the ones that really are material, are rare. The key thing here is materiality, not whether the flywheel exists, but whether the effect is strong enough to really tilt returns.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
I was actually going to ask about that one because in software and social consumer products, network effects is always the pitch. Once we get big enough, we create this huge barrier. You mentioned just now you often find that's not actually true. It's rarely something that'll become a barrier. Is there anything else you find with network? And I know your power is called network economies, not network effect. I guess just to be clear, are these the same thing in your mind with different words?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:02):
Yeah, kind of. I mean I have called it a type of power. So for me it's only those things which clear the significance barrier, hurdle rather that they're a large material. And so there are lots of things that I would say have network effects but not network economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:26):
Oh, interesting. Wait, can you speak to that? So there is a difference between these terms, network economies?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:30):
Yeah. So for me the difference is materiality is that whether the value benefit is large enough to engender a price delta significant enough to give you materially different margins into the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:50):
Basically, does that network effect have an actual impact on your business and your ability to price?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:55):
Yeah, it's not an impact, it's a material impact. So it could have... If it's a penny to your bottom line, that's one thing if it's a billion dollars or something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:06):
Wow, that's actually really interesting. Is there an example of a company that comes to mind, they had network effects but not network economies as a power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:26:12):
I think you could turn almost anywhere and get some modest network effects and any platform business would probably likely have some modest network effects. You asked me earlier and you sent me about Uber and Lyft, I'd say that they probably have network effects involved but not network economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
Wow, that's interesting. And the reason you're saying they don't have network economies is because they're still so competitive they still have to spend so much money to stay ahead and so the network is not-

Hamilton Helmer (00:26:51):
Yeah. Right. The advantage that they get, it's not material. Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Wow, that's so interesting. Along those lines, it's so interesting to see Uber and Lyft these days. In theory they both had some sort of strong network effect. I was just looking, so Lyft is 5% the market cap of Uber. Is there a lesson from just what it is that allowed Uber to just win and kind of run away with the market essentially?

Hamilton Helmer (00:27:25):
I'm not entirely sure, I'll take a guess, but take it as a unformed guess. I haven't really studied it carefully. I think that over time there, if I had to guess, I'd say they're probably modest scale economies in the business. And over time Uber has just very successfully played a war of attrition. And that's both been in how they run their... They made one initial misstep, which is they misdefined their business. They said it was international transportation and it's not. That business is extremely geographically specific.

(00:28:14):
If you have a great position in the Bay Area, it doesn't help you in London. And so their forays into China and everything really didn't make, but they pulled back on that, focused down on understanding their source of power, which was a geographically specific scale economy. And then they've done interesting things like Uber Eats where they've tried to utilize the platform that they have to get other opportunities for the one side of their platform, the drivers. And so if I had to guess, I'd say it was a well-played war of attrition with modest scale economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:02):
And is that attrition coming from a source of power or is that just like a broader, more strict?

Hamilton Helmer (00:29:06):
Yeah, it only works because there are modest scale economies. If there weren't any then if they did all this stuff, they'd still have a global and see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:16):
Got it. Let me go in a slightly different direction. We've talked about power, we've talked about strategy. There's also, there's this word moat that comes up a lot. Everyone's always trying to build a moat. In your mind, is a moat equivalent to a power? Is there a difference when people talk about these two?

Hamilton Helmer (00:29:30):
Power requires a benefit and a barrier, you have to have something that you do that gives you a better outcome than your competitors, lower cost or higher price, and then something that makes it impossible for somebody else to mimic that. So moat is the second. So it's not synonymous with power because you can have a moat around a very undesirable piece of property and wouldn't get you far. But I think it is pretty synonymous with barrier. I think Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, I admire enormously. I think I get credit for popularizing those concepts and I think the way they think about it is good. I'd say that 7 Powers is probably more systematic and comprehensive in saying that. I don't think. This is wonderful. I don't know if you've read any of the Microsoft antitrust literature that came out of their-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):
No.

Hamilton Helmer (00:30:42):
...lawsuit, but there was a communication between Bill Gates and Warren Buffett where Warren Buffett was saying why he couldn't invest in Microsoft. He just didn't understand it. And so that meant the idea of network economies and what the moat was there he didn't understand. But I think the concept of a moat is a good one. The idea that you have something that gives you a refuge from competing forces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
In terms of Warren Buffett, I found the quote about moats. Warren Buffett famously said, "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unreachable moats."

Hamilton Helmer (00:31:22):
Right. And so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:27):
Right. He's got it covered.

Hamilton Helmer (00:31:29):
But one of the tricks to understanding power is you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack. So I'll give you a Netflix example. So a company I admire a lot, and I think if some of the things that they had to do to develop their business were so important for their business that don't guarantee a castle. So for example, UI development, it's been an enormous amount of resources on trying to get just the very best UI, I mean a zillion AB tests, all kinds of things. Their recommendation engine, everybody's knows the story about how that went, their interface with the content world and all this. So those things are important. They're things they have to spend a lot of time and resources on, but they can largely be mimicked.

(00:32:31):
So when Netflix in an earlier phase was fighting Blockbuster, when Blockbuster finally threw in the towel, said, "Well, we done. Well, better do a mail or a DVD business." If you look at the Blockbuster site, their UI site, you couldn't tell it different from Netflix. They just copied it. And so all that thoughtfulness about which things you put first and how you structure it and all that to make this suitable was mimicable. So that's an understanding of looking at the properties you have and trying to figure out if they're a castle or a shack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:06):
I love that. This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the embedded integration platform for B2B SaaS product development teams. Are your users constantly requesting new integrations with other SaaS platforms that they use? Unfortunately, native product integrations take months of engineering to build and the maintenance never ends. Paragon enables your engineering team to ship integrations seven times faster than building in-house by removing the complexities around authentication, messy third-party APIs and debugging integration errors. Engineering teams at companies like CopyAI, Cinch, TLDB and over 100 other SaaS companies are using Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations.

(00:33:53):
The results, their shipping integrations on demand, which has led to higher product usage, better retention and more customer upsells. Visit useparagon.com/Lenny to see how Paragon can help you go to market faster with integrations today. That's use paragon.com/Lenny. So let's take this concept of 7 Powers. A lot of people listening to this are just like individual contributor product managers on teams building new products or iterating on products they already have. What do you suggest they do with this knowledge of there exists these ways to build benefits and barriers? I'm working on say a new product. What do you recommend they do? What's something they could do this week, next month to infuse these lessons into the products they're building?

Hamilton Helmer (00:34:41):
I'd say they're a few and it's a little bit different. I'm not a great fan of the strategically driven organization because that idea, because it fuzzes over how this knowledge is useful at different stages in the business. And so for somebody in that position, say a product manager in an existing successful business. So it is important in terms of just understanding their business to know what their source of power is because they... And that can inform them about what it is that they're working for. And also they may see things since they're down in the weeds, they may see things that are important to that that they need to bring to other people's attention. Because they're the ones that really have the knowledge of what the heck's going on. There's another aspect I mentioned before, this idea of transforming, of starting up entirely new things. And usually... I wouldn't say, usually I say it's not uncommon for ideas about that to bubble up from down below.

(00:36:03):
And so that's another source. So let's separate a business into three phases, origination, takeoff, and stability. So the answers I've given are more in the stability phase. In the takeoff phase, let's say you've launched a product, you've gotten customer traction, now you're in a phase where there's just very rapid growth, probably other entrants like you, what are you facing? What you're facing is remember that underneath all of this is a change in technology. That's what made the product market fit possible in the first place. But that doesn't just stop. That if you're in a technology wave, often there are all kinds of offshoots both for you and the compliments to your business and everything else going on at the same time.

(00:36:59):
And to win at that stability phase, which is really a market share win, you have to be aware of those and understand, okay, we have to incorporate this new feature. Or maybe now things have gotten to the point where this new market segment is, our product is attractive before it wasn't. This is meat and potato stuff for somebody at that level and it may well be the decisive element in terms of whether you win that market share battle with the other contenders. And so you have a very, very important role at that point. And so I'd say the first thing to do with your question is to make sure you think about the different phases of this and then ask what those responsibilities are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:51):
What about for people that are just trying to get better at being strategic, thinking strategically something every product leader is always encouraged to do, become a better strategic thinker, build as muscle of strategy, what do you often advise to people just get better at the stuff? Obviously read your book.

Hamilton Helmer (00:38:09):
Read the book, and then have conversations with your colleagues about the topic because as you internalize what that means and how, have conversations with them about do we really have this kind of power? What's going on here? What's important? What isn't. Those conversations tend to allow you to get a better grip on things. I mean in the case of Netflix, Reed actually had me come in and train the top a hundred people in Netflix and strategy. We actually ran classes in the company, but that's unusual I'd say. And I didn't have the book yet. And so I think the book gets people pretty far down that path already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:55):
And you don't do that anymore, I imagine if someone wanted to do that today, not an option.

Hamilton Helmer (00:38:59):
I sadly don't have the time. I mean I do often do fireside chats at company meetings and that kind of thing, but not a full-blown course and I'm not teaching at Stanford anymore either. And so I don't. I enjoyed that immensely wonderful people to work with. But sadly I don't have the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
You're about to get a lot of requests for fireside chats. I hope you're ready. You mentioned AI at some point in our chat. I'm curious how you think AI is going to change your 7 Powers framework. Do you think defensibility goes down in general? Will certain forms of power become more important or harder to achieve? How do you think about AI?

Hamilton Helmer (00:39:44):
Yeah, it's a great question. I mean we're all in this phase of wondering exactly how generative AI is going to play out. My own view, currently I don't see any change in seven powers from it in terms of an eighth power or something. But the issues that it brings up, like scale economies, I mean think of scale economies. If you have a fixed cost of trying to develop a model of a billion dollars or something or network effects, will AI models develop so that they learn in a way that for one user's interaction helps another user's interaction? That would be a powerful network economy. Or if it learns, if you think of if it learns about you and becomes a better psychiatrist or something, then that's a switching cost. So all these things are relevant to which business models will work and I find that useful.

(00:40:51):
But I think in general, the way I think about it is it's a standard form of potentially very powerful technology that is being introduced into the business world and just asking how that plays out. I currently tend to think of that there's three types of plays. There's the company that's the technology play itself. So if you think of microprocessors, it would be Intel. There's the companies that wouldn't exist without the technology. So for semiconductors it would be Microsoft. And then there are the companies that utilize the technology, but it had existed before and after. So for semiconductors it would be automobiles. They used a ton of chips, but there were still cars before, after.

(00:41:48):
And so I'm of the view, I'm very much uncertain at this point that generative AI, its biggest impact will be that tertiary class. It will be used in a lot of things that existed before and exist after, but are made better by it like semiconductors and automobiles. And so it reminds me, if you think of really big technology shifts like this, it reminds me of electricity. When electricity came, you could completely reconfigure a factory floor. You no longer had to have... You could have the power source essentially at the operating unit of an operator. But that took a lot of redesign, incorporation, investment, learning, complements, all kinds of stuff. I tend to think this will be more like that. There will be some pure cases. People will want to have them write their term paper with ChatGPT or something. But if you think of businesses, it's hard for me to think of a single functional area in a business that with redesign couldn't benefit. So accounting, HR, R&D all have uses of this but requires incorporation, which is always troublesome.

(00:43:30):
And so that's my view. But there certainly will be businesses that couldn't exist without it. And there's some that are coming up and some of those are in fact the businesses that empower the tertiary need, they're the ones that bring in. But if you go back, this will date me, but if you go back into business history, back in, I guess it was the 90s, there was this thing called business process re-engineering, the idea that you could take a computer sensibility into business processes, redesign them and get these monstrous cost savings. And it was a gigantic consulting opportunity for people. Whole companies got developed based on that and it feels more like that to me, but it's very interesting. I could be wrong, but it feels different than crypto. It feels like there's more of a real ultimate use case. I mean, if it really is true what they say that a 50% improvement in programming efficacy is not uncommon, just that proposition alone is worth an awful lot of money if you think how many programmers are in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
No question. You mentioned eighth power. I just want to check, is there an emerging eighth power you wish you maybe would've included or maybe added in the future that's like, "Oh, maybe this is on the edge," or it's like, "Nope, we got these seven?"

Hamilton Helmer (00:45:15):
It's a great question. I'm always looking for it because if you find it it probably means it's so obscure there, it'll also be a great investment opportunity. We're looking all the time, but so far, no. So far I'm pretty satisfied that seven is an exhaustive set, but never say never. That's an empirical seven, not a theoretical seven.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:37):
If we start seeing you making incredible returns, you've clearly found an eighth power [inaudible 00:45:41]-

Hamilton Helmer (00:45:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):
I want to close one thread on a power that you mentioned that is often a pitfall, which is around process power and basically execution. A lot of people think so in a lot of decks it's like, oh, we have the most amazing team, we move the fastest, we're earliest. You mentioned how rarely is that actually a power actually being able to execute and create a process that is an actual barrier? Can you just talk a bit more about that to help people understand okay, it's probably not our power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:46:09):
One of the great thinkers in strategy was this Harvard professor Michael Porter, and he in probably 40 years ago, made the very controversial statement that operational excellence is not strategy. He got a lot of people of the Harvard Business School faculty really mad at him because that's what their careers were about and it sounded like he was dissing them. But the point he was making was when you get to this end state, if you already have power that things that drive operational excellence can be mimicked because you can hire a consulting firm who has best practices, knowledges that come in and get you up to snuff. You can hire people from your competitors who know how to do it better. And that's true, but it's also true in this takeoff phase in a business that we talked about before, when you're trying to attain competitive position, operational excellence is everything.

(00:47:14):
And so if you think of strategy, not statically endpoints like Professor Porter was, but if you look at dynamically how you get there, operational excellence is essential for a strategy. So think of those things I mentioned before about Netflix, about their UI and recommendation engine and so on, or international rollout, all those things. They were in a battle to get more subscribers than other people and those were critical for that. But in themselves, they're critical in attaining competitive position, but in themselves, they're not sources of power typically, unless there's some very tight considerations here or very demanding considerations for the... Unless if they have to be material, but they also have to be opaque or some way people can't easily imitate them. Either they don't understand what's going on or they might be opaque. So for example, think of TSMC. So when they put up the latest fab and get that operational, are there a lot of steps in doing that?

(00:48:43):
They know how to do with their staff is trained to do it, but it's not documented necessarily and you can't imitate it. Then maybe they have it. I don't know if they have process power or not, but it takes that level of complexity. In my book, I use the example of Toyota and a car manufacturing is complex enough that you can have this opacity in terms of material steps, but it's not common. So if you're in a stability phase of business, you're stuck with this funny thing, which is most of your day is on those issues and it should be because if you don't do it, a competitor can and they can end up better than you. And so you're on a treadmill and that's the way business is. That's fine. And if you stop running that treadmill, you get creamed. So you got to do it, it's most of your day, but it's not power. And there are those rare cases where it's so material and so inimitable that it can be power, but they're rare.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:02):
I like the heuristic that if you haven't written it down or you can't describe it, that might be a sign that maybe process power is a power of yours.

Hamilton Helmer (00:50:13):
Yeah. And there isn't a consulting firm that offers to bring you up to speed on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:20):
They'll make you more like Amazon as a service. Kind of along these same lines, you talk about how the only things that create value in a company are power, market size and operational excellence. And I think hearing that will blow a lot of people's minds because they think there's so many things that contribute to the value of a company and you whittle it down to these three things. What can you say about that insight?

Hamilton Helmer (00:50:47):
So I'd say they're right and I'm right. They're right because there are this incredible... I mean business is really hard and there are just a multitude of things you have to pay attention for. I'm right because all those things fall into those three categories. So it's an exhaustive set and it simply comes out of the math. So we're both right I'd say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):
Final question, the intent of a lot of your work is to empower founders. I'm curious if you've noticed any broad economic trends or shifts that you think will make life easier or harder for founders in the coming years?

Hamilton Helmer (00:51:32):
Personally, I am very, very concerned about the debt trajectory of the United States and of many countries around the world, but I'll pick on the United States, but it's a trend going on everywhere. We're on a trajectory for this extremely high indebtedness. And so if you think about the last 30 years, right? There's been a crisis about once every 10 years. So there's the dot-com bust, there's the financial crisis, there was COVID. Nothing makes me think that the frequency will be a lot less. I don't know what, who knows? These are all uncertain events. But imagine if we got to one of those and we had no dry powder and dry powder for us is the ability to heavily deficit spend take on debt. And fortunately our government did that in both the financial crisis and in COVID. And because that people had jobs. My own view about the financial crisis is that if we hadn't done that, plus having Ben Bernanke as the head of the Fed, we would've gone into another great depression.

(00:52:52):
It was that ugly. So this current debt trajectory, you don't know how long it will take exactly when, but eventually that will mean we will not have dry powder. People will not respect the credit worthiness of this country. So that worries me a lot. And it utterly will affect the idea of company founding because if you get into a crisis like that, the capital markets lock up and it gets very difficult to do anything. And to really stretch my credibility here, I'll opine on just how hard a problem this is to solve. The reason this is so difficult for this country to solve and other countries is that it is right at the crux of the delicate dance between capitalism and democracy. So if you think about the problem, of course that's driving all this is entitlements. There's discretionary spending, certain recovery programs and stuff, but those can go away. The underlying trend that people just can't get their arms around is entitlements. And anybody who looks at the numbers can see that. Every economist knows that. But that's not an easy fix.

(00:54:18):
And the reason it's not an easy fix is there are two opposing views of what's going on, and there's no way to resolve those two views. One is that capitalism is rapacious and results in more and more inequality and the government has to do something about it. And the other is that the government is on a path that is creeping socialism that will undermine our freedom and economic sufficiency. And the poster child for the rapacious capitalism. One is, I don't know if you've seen the recent analysis of inequality in the United States just came out, much more robust analysis. And it said that basically inequality in the last 60 years of the United States is unchanged, but that's post-transfer, post-tax inequality, which basically says the amount of taxing and transferring going on was about right. So it says that the amount we're spending is about right from that perspective, that it compensates for the other inequities and we should be spending that much so we should tax more.

(00:55:30):
And the poster child for the other point of view of the dangers of government is the steadily increasing without interruption percentage of the economy that is government. And to levels that 75 years ago, people would've thought absolutely impossible. So there are these two views about what's going on. One is that we're compensating for the normal inequities of capitalism, and the other is that we're headed down a path to socialism and ruin. And that leads to a deadlock, which is you don't tax anymore and you don't cut spending and that leaves deficits. So anyway, a long, long rant, sorry but that trend is extremely politically difficult to deal with and extremely threatening and that concerns me immensely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Not to leave listeners with a very sad state of affairs.

# Inside Devin: The AI engineer that's set to write 50% of its company’s code this year | Scott Wu

## Transcript

Scott Wu (00:00:00):
Our whole team is only like 15 engineers a year. We use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin. Most folks on the team are definitely working with up to five Devins at once, and so Devin merges like several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
What percentage of your PRs are Devin versus humans right now?

Scott Wu (00:00:16):
It's in the neighborhood of a quarter or so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
Where do you think this will be at the end of the year?

Scott Wu (00:00:21):
Honestly, we expect it to be a decent bit more than half.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
You guys are so ahead of how companies work with AI engineers.

Scott Wu (00:00:28):
AI is going to be the biggest technology shift of our lives, so most of the big tech revolutions that we've had over the last 50 years, like personal computer, and the internet, and the mobile phone, they all had this big hardware component that was a big part of the distribution. Folks who were building for those industries kind of saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, right, as the number of people connected to the internet increase. One of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. There's no weight on hardware distribution. It means that the space is just growing so exponentially.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
How is the act of being an engineer and building changing?

Scott Wu (00:01:05):
I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now. Pretty quickly. The form factor of what it means to be a programmer obviously is going to change, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being able to tell your computer what's do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:20):
Today my guest is Scott Wu. Scott is the co-founder and CEO of Cognition, which makes a product called Devin, the world's first autonomous AI software engineer. Unlike other AI tools that I've highlighted on this podcast, Devin is designed to act like an actual remote engineer that you chat with like you would with any other human engineer through Slack or through its dedicated website. When Devin launched about a year ago, it was very much a junior engineer. Over the past year, they've made a lot of progress and Devin is now being used by tons of companies in production. We chatted about how their engineering team of 15 uses Devins to build Devin, including how every engineer uses about five Devins each to help them code and move faster. How a quarter of their pull requests today are committed by Devins and that they expect this to be over 50% by the end of the year.

(00:02:05):
We also talk about how Scott imagines software engineering is going to look in the future and how the role of an engineer changes from a coder to an architect. We also get into the eight pivots that they went through before landing on this path, why Scott believes AI tools like this will lead to more engineer hiring versus less. Also where the name Devin comes from and so much more. This episode is going to blow your mind. I highly recommend you listen to it if you're at all interested about where engineering, product building, and AI is going. A huge thank you to Claire Voue for suggesting a bunch of great questions for this conversation.

Brandon Foo (00:04:15):
Hey Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):
So integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?

Brandon Foo (00:04:21):
Integrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customer's business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
So where does Paragon fit into all this?

Brandon Foo (00:04:42):
Well, these integrations are a pain to build and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from RAG data ingestion to agentic actions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
And I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.

Brandon Foo (00:05:01):
Exactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like You.com, AI21 and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):
If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out paragon@useparagon.com/lenny. Scott, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Scott Wu (00:05:29):
Thanks so much for having me. Excited to be on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):
I'm really excited to have you here because you are building and you've been building something that is very different from what a lot of other AI companies have been doing for a long time, although they are starting to converge to where you guys are now. We're going to talk about that and it's also just such a unique point in the history of AI and just the journey of AI. And so it's really cool to be chatting right now. And I feel like we're going to chat again in a few years and be like, wow, we were so right about so much and so wrong about so much.

Scott Wu (00:05:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):
And so I'm excited to have you here. Let's start with talking about Devin, giving people an understanding of just what the heck Devin is, is the main product that you guys build. What is the simplest way to understand what is Devin?

Scott Wu (00:06:10):
Absolutely. And so Devin is a fully autonomous software engineer that is going to work on tasks end to end, and so there are a lot of great tools for all parts of the stack of the AI code workflow. What Devin does is it is a full asynchronous workflow, and so you can tag Devin on an issue in Slack, you're talking about an issue and you tag Devin, you can tag Devin in Linear, you can have Devin and Devin will make pull requests in your GitHub, and so it's very much built to work with engineering teams as your junior engineer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
Amazing, okay. So I remember when you guys launched this, there was this big pitch of this is your new AI engineer and it was really good at a lot of stuff. It wasn't great at other things. It's been a year now about since you guys launched, is that right?

Scott Wu (00:06:50):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):
What's the best way to think about the level of seniority that engineer had back in the day when you guys launched and then the level of seniority of engineer today if that's, I don't know, measure of how to think about Devin?

Scott Wu (00:07:02):
Yeah, and it's crazy to think about by the way, because a year ago when we did the initial launch, I mean people didn't really believe that an agent was possible. Right. And it was, I mean, it was a very different time. So like start of 2024, things with model capabilities were definitely quite a bit earlier on, reasoning especially was quite a bit earlier on. And yeah, I mean, in the time since then it's obviously developed a lot. I think in terms of practical skills, there's some comparisons we make. Sometimes we kind of say, well, when we got started it was kind of like a high school CS student and then as time went on, it became more of a college intern and now it's like a junior engineer. But I would say though that those are more rough guidelines because I really like the phrase jagged intelligence for example, because obviously there are certain things that it is much better at than a human. There are certain things that it's much worse at than a human.

(00:07:52):
And I think over the last year we've learned a lot especially about not just coding agents but agents in general just really building out how all of us should be working and interacting with agents as part of our flow. And so a lot of the things that we built, I mean, there was no Slack, there was no GitHub integration, there was no Linear, there was no interactive planning phase working back and forth. There was no way to touch up Devin's code. And so a lot of the features that we've built on the product side since then have really been about basically yeah, figuring out how to make working with Devin and handing off tasks to Devin as smooth of an experience as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:27):
That's so interesting. So a lot of the work has gone not into how do we just make Devin the best possible engineer, but it's how to work with this new type of entity that we haven't ever worked with.

Scott Wu (00:08:37):
I think it's a 50/50 of both. I think the capabilities obviously have improved a ton and we've seen these get better and get measurably better. But I think the other side of it is everything to do with yeah, really the product interface and the tools and so on. And I think today folks generally know how to use chatbots and to with chatbots, right, and that's an interface that people are familiar with and obviously with agents it's still like a real curve, I think to learn how to use them and how to get the most out of them. And so it's really exciting to see a lot of others starting to build and do a lot more in the agent space as well. But I think this is the kind of thing that we're all really figuring out together as a space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:15):
What can you share about just the scale of Devin at this point, whatever you're comfortable sharing, and then just where do you think the level of Devin's coding abilities will be in a year?

Scott Wu (00:09:24):
So we work with companies of all stages and sizes. On the smallest end, it goes to startups of just one or two people who are using Devin to build out a lot of their kind of initial prototype or initial product all the way up to big public companies, Fortune 100 companies or public banks or things like that who are using Devin across their engineering teams. In general, we've seen a huge range of the use cases there. And obviously the kinds of engineering work that you're doing at a one or two person startup, they're very different from the kind of work that you're doing at a public bank.

(00:09:55):
But throughout it's all been basically yeah, being that junior buddy of yours that makes you go faster and really multiplies you, I would say. I think it can multiply you as an engineer obviously by just letting you work with your own team of Devins instead of having to be kind of fully synchronous on a single task. And then it's also kind of multiplying your team and multiplying your team's knowledge base because Devin really accumulates a lot of the knowledge from working with every member of your team and is able to bring that into each new session.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):
Awesome. We're going to show people how it actually works later in the podcast. We're going to do a few live demos, but let's actually go to the beginning of the journey. What's just the origin story of Devin? How did this all begin?

Scott Wu (00:10:33):
The founding team, I mean most of us have known each other for years and years and years actually. And for almost everyone, this is our first time working together, but we've known each other a long time. And we all actually had our own kind of journeys in AI for the last decade or so. And so for myself, I ran a company before this called Lunchclub, which was an AI for a professional networking product and I ran that for about five years. And one of my co-founders, Steven was one of the first engineers at a company called Scale AI, which has obviously grown a lot and done very well. My other co-founder Walden, was an early engineer at a company called Cursor, which has also obviously grown a lot and done really well. And our whole team was kind of like that. Many of us knew each other from competitive programming and math competitions, but we had stayed very closely in touch in the decade since then and we've all kind of all had our own journeys.

(00:11:22):
And so we had one person who was running teams at Neuro, we had one person who was at Waymo, someone who had their own YC tools startup for machine learning, and we were really excited to build something together. And this was around late 2023, so about a year and a half ago at this point. And yeah, when we got started, I mean I think there were a couple of things that we felt really strongly about and one was that reinforcement learning was really working and was going to be the next big paradigm shift in capabilities. Back then it was the initial ChatGPT launch in 2022, and those models were, to first order were what we would call imitation learning in AI, right, which is basically you have the model read all the texts that you can find on the internet and then train it to talk like somebody on the internet would talk. Right. And there are kind of obviously a lot more details on top of that, but that's kind of the first order pass of what was really done.

(00:12:16):
And it was amazing. Right. I mean, it passed the churn test, it was able to respond and to have encyclopedic knowledge about a lot of things. And I think this new paradigm which we've gotten into over this last year or year and a half is really high compute RL, which is a very different paradigm, right, which is basically the ability to go and do work on task and put something together and then be evaluated on whether that was correct or incorrect and use that knowledge to decide what to do and to learn from that. Right. And so we felt very strongly that that was going to happen. I think for us, code was the natural thing to work on for a couple reasons. One, because we're all programmer nerds ourselves, and so teaching AI to code is about as cool as it gets for us, but also because code has this whole automated feedback loop, right, where you can run the code and that is the kind of automated feedback that really feeds into the RL, which makes these models so great at coding.

(00:13:06):
And then the other thing that we felt very strongly about was that the product experience was going to shift from what I'll call text completion to agents basically. Right. And to first order, I would kind of say there's been a lot of great experiences in text completion. It's been used for marketing, it's been used for customer support, it's been used for education and in Coda obviously as well. The GitHub copilot was kind of really the dominant product of that initial wave. Right.

(00:13:34):
But I think that the big shift that we really felt we would see is moving from kind of this text to text model to an actual autonomous system that can make decisions, that can interact with the real world, that can take in feedback, that can iterate and take multiple steps to solve problems. And now we call that agents, but that was what we were really excited about at the time. So it was always coding, it was always agents. And in some ways that kind of feels like it should have been cleared from the start. But even with that, I feel like we've pivoted eight times or something within coding agents over the last year and a half, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):
I just noticed recently all the AI, top AI companies sort of, not all, but many of them, the product that is winning is different, has a different name from the company, which is not typical, Cursors, Anysphere, Bolt, StackBlitz, you guys are Cognition Labs, like V0 is Vercel. And it just tells me these all emerge later in the company's journey and they tried a bunch of stuff and like, oh wow, this thing worked and it's so interesting that it's so common amongst these top AI companies.

Scott Wu (00:14:34):
Yeah, and there's even, I mean OpenAI, ChatGPT, Anthropic and Claude and Google. Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, yeah, I agree. So when we got started, it wasn't even really a company. I mean, it was more like a project or a hackathon almost. We got a bunch, we booked an Airbnb basically for a couple of weeks. This was around Thanksgiving time and just got a bunch of people together who were just excited to hack on some projects and build something cool. And it's funny, actually the first thing that we were building for actually was more solving these more contest programming problems and using an agentic loop to really do better on that. And so obviously if you run your code on the test cases, you can evaluate, there's a lot of agentic work that you can do there to try and do better, and that we spent some time on that initially. And then we've kind of gone from, I mean the story of the whole company for us in some sense has been going from hacker house to hacker house.

(00:15:26):
So after that we had another hacker house and that's where kind of some of the initial ideas for Devin came and really building a software engineering agent and not just a coding agent and having to interact with a lot of these tools, but even then there were so many iterations. And even the idea of talking to Devin for example was like, it was something that we had to come up with. Right. Initially, it was just like you hand off a task and then it works and then it shows you this whole finished code. Right. And now obviously it's like you can jump in at any time, you can get feedback on the plan, you guys can scope out the task together when you're working with Devin. And a lot of these things we had to develop obviously, and certainly we've learned a lot about the use cases, the form factor. We've made a lot of big improvements and step function improvements on the capabilities and Devin's ability to use tools and to bug and make decisions.

(00:16:11):
And so it's yeah, it's been a fun journey. I mean, I think I would say that the grounding question for us really, which is one that we think about all the time, is really just what is the future of software engineering and how should we be working with AI to write code? Because I think at the end of the day, of course that's what underlines all of the product decisions that we make, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):
I like that you're asking the juicy question I wanted to get to. Before I ask it just for the history books, when did you guys start kind of hacking around and when did Devin launch? How long was that period?

Scott Wu (00:16:45):
Yeah, so we started in November of 2023, which was then yeah, just like hackathon mode. We officially made it into a company around the start of 2024, and then our initial launch was in March. And so it was like nonstop, I mean it's been nonstop for the entire last 17 months, but it's getting to the launch and then obviously working with enterprises and developing the product a lot more, building it and getting it to work for a lot of practical use cases and then making it fully available self-serve in December of last year. And now we've rolled out 2.0 obviously just a few weeks ago. And so it's been a very busy time for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:25):
Understatement of the century. Let me ask this question because you touched on it a bit, this whole idea of Devin as a person and this idea of creating a personality for Devin. It's unlike any other, I believe, AI app. No one else has a name and you don't think of it as a person. What made you guys decide to go that approach and just how do you design it to work well that way?

Scott Wu (00:17:44):
I would say it's a decision we're pretty proud of, I would say. I mean, I think there's a lot of different product experiences out there, and I think the thing that really makes Devin unique in what it does is that you can really hand off and more and more what we've seen honestly is that I think a lot of kind of explaining the Devin experience to folks is really just explain it as, yeah, this is your junior buddy. And that goes for a lot of the parts of the flow where in the onboarding for example, initially I would say we've definitely had a lot of users come in and just kind of see the blank screen and not really know, or they'd ask, "Hey, I'm going to do this whole big re-architecture, the whole code base."

(00:18:21):
And basically what we've learned over time is to basically get folks to think more like whoa, whoa, whoa, let's work on getting the repository set up first. Let's make sure we hand Devin a couple one pointer tasks so it can get familiar with the code base. Let's get it the thing. If Devin needs to be able to test the code or run the linter or CI or things like that. Obviously we want to make sure Devin's got its own virtual machine set up to be able to do that.

(00:18:45):
And similarly, I think the usage pattern, I think often it wasn't clear and obviously you can sit and just kind of watch Devin do it action by action and work that way, but we found that the best workflow really as a team building a lot of stuff was to work with multiple Devins and to run them asynchronously and to kick them off and to only jump in basically as you needed to provide feedback or steer the plan or anything like that. And so in many ways, I think Devin as a name really is our attempt to kind of capture the soul of that as a product where it really is treating it like a bit more of an autonomous entity that you can hand off tasks, that you can work with, that you should be teaching and learning with over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:29):
I want to come back to an area you started us down and then I took us away from which is impact on software engineering and how software engineering is going to change. So there's kind of two parts to this. Just like when people are using Devin today, say this year, how is the act of being an engineer and building changing for those companies? What does that look like?

Scott Wu (00:19:49):
By the way, we're all software engineers ourselves. It's like I'm a programmer by training and still a programmer at heart certainly. And I think the way that we've always thought about it is there's layers of abstraction and there's tools, and one way I would say it at a high level is kind of I think of AI in general as, yeah, I mean computers are obviously getting more and more intelligence and are able to do more and more and it's possible there may come a day where computers truly do everything that we do and humans are not responsible for any of it.

(00:20:20):
I don't expect that to come particularly soon, but I guess what I would say is until that point, for as long as we're still part of the equation, one of the most important things to do obviously is for us as humans is to instruct our computers on what we want and what we want to build and what we want to do. Right. And software engineering is, we think of it today obviously as Python and C++ and JavaScript and all these things, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being to tell your computer what to do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is, if anything, is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful. And I think the thing that's really exciting for us is yeah, it's really seeing that kind of iterative transformation. And so you ask what things look like today, and I would say, yeah, it really is like having a junior buddy or really a team of junior buddies that you can work with. Right.

(00:21:12):
And so every engineer on our team, we use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin, and so Devin merges several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month, which is, I mean, our whole team is only 15 engineers, and so it's a pretty sizable fraction of all the code that we write. And the way that we use it is basically, yeah, everyone's got their whole team of Devins. If you're going to be looking through various issues, if you're going through feature requests, if you're going through bugs, if you're going through new paradigms that you want to build, then it is naturally the case that there's a lot of handoff points where you just say, "Hey, at Devin, here's what's going on. Can you please take a pass at this?" Right.

(00:21:47):
And sometimes Devin will be able to do the task 100% autonomously and just makes the PR and then you merge the PR and that's great. Sometimes you want to be able to jump in for the 10 or 20% that really needs your help. Maybe there's a few details with how exactly you want to scope it or how you're architecting this feature, or maybe you want to go and test the front end at the end yourself to make sure it looks exactly the way that you want and give your one or two lines of feedback after that. Right. But a lot of it is really yeah, is kind of like yeah, learning to work with Devin to be able to just do more in parallel and build more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):
What percentage of your PRs are Devin versus humans right now?

Scott Wu (00:22:25):
Yeah, I'd have to look, but it's in the neighborhood of a quarter or so of all of our-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:30):
Wow.

Scott Wu (00:22:31):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:33):
And then what was it like six months ago?

Scott Wu (00:22:35):
Oh yeah, it's grown a ton for, I mean, we've seen it grown exponentially internally ourselves as well. And so it's kind of an interesting one where again, it's always both the capabilities and the product interface. And so I think the intelligence has increased a lot. But the other thing of course is that we've spent a lot of time in figuring out how to build and to really kind of build for an interface where you can get Devin's value on tasks where Devin is able to do the 80 or 90%. And so Devin is obviously not perfect and it'll make mistakes and so on. And a lot of the question is basically, yeah, how do you scope out your initial task with Devin and then just kind of set Devin off and have it go and do the things that you want do? How do you come in at the end and review and give feedback? How do you make sure Devin learns over time? How are you able to kind of just check in as needed and course correct if you want to?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):
Okay, so today about quarter of your PRs are Devins. Where do you think this will be at the end of the year? What would you guess?

Scott Wu (00:23:31):
I think by the end of this year, we expect it to be more than half. And I mean, as time goes on, one of the things that we've seen is just you're able to do more and more and more work asynchronously. Right. And you're able to hand off more and more. I think the soul of programming, the soul of software engineering has really been about through all the areas, not just now, but even when it was assembly, right, and even when it was Pascal and even when it was punch cards or whatever, I think the soul of it has really been basically just about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly...

Scott Wu (00:24:00):
... about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly what is the solution that you want to build. Thinking through the architecture, thinking through the details, and really mapping out in your mind exactly what you want to build basically and what you want to have your computer do. I think that's what makes software engineering really great and I think that's the funnest part of software engineering. 

(00:24:21):
I think, at the same time, that's probably in the neighborhood of 10% of the average software engineer's time, right? Because 90% of the time is you've got this Kubernetes error, then you've got to debug, and you have to see what went wrong and the system crash, or you left some port open and this is messing up, or there's a bug report that you have to take care of, or you've got to migrate your code, or you got it upgraded to a new version or things like that. A lot more implementation. 

(00:24:48):
One of the ways that we've kind of thought about Devin in building Devin is really allowing engineers to go from bricklayer to architect, so to speak. A lot of it is just getting to the point where you can do the high-level directing and you can basically specify things exactly how you want. I think it's very much about still having the human in control and having the human able to do the full specification, but just multiplying the magnitude of what you can do and what you can build in one day or one hour or however long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:18):
In the future, say someone is trying to get into software engineering, thinking about becoming an engineer, first of all, do you think people should... Classic question everyone's getting these days. Should you still learn to code? 

Scott Wu (00:25:29):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):
I'd love your perspective there. And then two, for people that are engineers today, what skills do you think will be more and more important and then less important in this discussion of moving from bricklayer to architect? 

Scott Wu (00:25:41):
Yeah, for sure. I love this question. First of all, the question of whether you should still learn to code, my answer would be absolutely yes. I think, to a large extent, when you take computer science classes and when you learn these fundamentals, sure you're learning a little bit about how a particular language is, syntax works or something like that. But honestly, most of what you're learning really is about the ability to logically break down problems for number one. And two, I would say is just the model of a computer and a lot of these decisions and a lot of the abstractions that we've built over time. 

(00:26:11):
What is a database and how should you think about a database? What is a garbage collection system and how do those work and all of these different pieces? The reason I think that's important is because it's the same with a lot of these other... Arguably we've already gone through these phases in programming and I think this next one is going to be somewhat faster and somewhat bigger, but in many ways a similar flavor, which is when you work with Python today, obviously, a lot of things are already abstracted away from you.

(00:26:38):
In some sense, someone from 50 years ago might already call Python. You just get to explain in English what you want and now the computer does it for you. That's great and I think it's really powerful. It's opened it up. I mean, we have far more programmers, obviously, than we ever have before because of that, but I would say certainly as you're building your skills as an engineer, it really helps a lot to understand the abstractions and to be able to peel the layers beneath. Folks will use assembly for example if they're really performance optimizing a piece of code, but also in order to build good systems and to understand these things, you certainly want to understand these abstractions of how does networking work. 

(00:27:18):
What is TCP/IP like exactly or what happens with this Python code when it gets interpreted or all of these details. Similarly, I think we will get to a state where, with no experience at all, you're going to be able to build some pretty cool stuff and to do some pretty amazing work just by explaining what it is that you want. But I think that, for quite some time, you really want to be able to think precisely about the details, to peel back the abstractions, to be very precise about what it is that you want to build and how.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):
And then for skills that you think are more and more valuable for engineers, where should engineers today be leaning more and more into versus like, "Forget this. I don't need to think about this anymore"?

Scott Wu (00:28:00):
For sure. I think architect... I mean, we already have a term for architect and engineering and I think it is directionally the right term. It's, I think, one thing to just do a routine implementation and write boilerplate code and things like that. I would say that, in many ways, AI coding has already made us much faster at that, but I think a lot of the core questions of understanding very complex systems and working in the context of the whole company and thinking about the product that you're building or the work that you're doing and understanding, "Okay, what are the problems that we want to solve? How do we want to solve those problems? What is exactly the solution that we want to build? What are all of these key decisions and trade-offs that we're going to be making?"

(00:28:40):
Basically, I think folks who are able to do that really, really well are just going to be able to leverage themselves more and more. If anything, I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now than there are today. I think pretty quickly the form factor of what it means to be a programmer, obviously, is going to change. And in some sense, it already has, but I think there's just going to be so much more for us to build. Folks talk about Jevons Paradox all the time. I mean, software is truly the shining example of Jevons Paradox, where we have always managed as a society to find more and more things that we want to build software for and build more code for. I really think there's a lot more out there to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):
For people that don't know Jevons Paradox, can you briefly explain it?

Scott Wu (00:29:26):
Absolutely. Yeah. Jevons Paradox just says that as the price of something goes down, it can still be the case that the total spend on it actually goes up. You can think about this with money, you can think about this with time or resources, but the direct version here is, I think, as it becomes easier and easier to program and as programming becomes more and more effective, I think we're going to have a lot more programmers. I think in a kind of zero-sum view, you might say, "Well, we're going to be 10 times faster at software engineering and it means that we're going to need 10 times fewer software engineers." But I think in practice, what really is going to happen is actually we're going to build even more than 10 times as much code. And because all of the work that we do is so capped, obviously, on our ability to actually build and execute and iterate, we're going to have so many great ideas out there, we're going to have so many great products out there. People are going to build a lot more personalized experiences, for example, and there's going to be a lot to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):
Going back to the way you guys use Devin, you said that every engineer has this fleet of Devins. How many Devins per engineer do you find most people are working with these days at your company?

Scott Wu (00:30:33):
Yeah. It's very asynchronous. Obviously, you can kick them up and start them up and shut them down basically as you see fit, but most folks on the team are often working with up to five Devins at once, I would say. It's a nice flow where you think through, "All right, what are the five things that we want to get done today?" You have Devin one do number one, you have Devin two do number two, Devin three... For what it's worth, I think it's taken us some time to adjust to it and get to the point where it's really intuitive for us, but I think it's definitely a different experience where you're handing off most things asynchronously. 

(00:31:14):
The goal for each of your tasks is to be there for the parts that really need your expertise, either you really, really need to define exactly what it is that you're solving for and what you're building or maybe some of the more complex parts where you want to steer Devin towards, particularly what kinds of changes you want to make. "I want the class to be set up this way and we should go and change all the downstream references to this as well or whatever." But basically having Devin do the bulk of the work asynchronously with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):
And then how many engineers do you guys have roughly?

Scott Wu (00:31:46):
Yeah, our engineering team today is about 15 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
15. 15.

Scott Wu (00:31:50):
15, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):
Holy moly. Okay. And then each one has five-ish Devins.

Scott Wu (00:31:54):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
So there's five times the number of Devins as engineers. What I love about this is just a glimpse into where the future is going. You guys are so ahead of how companies work with AI engineers. Seeing how you operate is going to be, as a sense, essentially how most companies will end up operating.

Scott Wu (00:32:11):
Yeah. For what it's worth, we've already seen this shift, I would say, ourselves where... In terms of the team, obviously, folks don't spend that much of their time just writing out boilerplate or just doing pure implementation of features. People get to spend much more of their time focused on really just thinking about the core questions of, "How do we make Devin better? What is the right interface for Devin? What is the right flow or the right set of features that's really going to make this as great of an experience as possible?" That's how we like things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:46):
When is the point you reach, where there's takeoff of this being the by... Your Devin starts moving so much further ahead of everyone else. Once you have enough Devins doing all these things, they're just like wherever and you're 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 100 years ahead.

Scott Wu (00:33:00):
Honestly, as a community, I think all of us as engineers around the world, I think, are going to have to think about this and build for this and adapt to these new technologies. But what I would say is, I think more and more... Especially as capabilities get better, but certainly even in studies say today, I think more and more things are going to shift towards this asynchronous flow. And one of the reasons I would say for that is in the real world, you're just capped by real world constraints. I think that one way to put it is kind of like... Don't take these numbers exactly, but it's kind of like the first order math of it is, of course, being able to write files or to complete this function or complete this line or things like that.

(00:33:44):
It helps a ton. It's a really great experience. There's a lot of parts of building software that obviously are almost not that at all, right? If you have a bug that you're trying to fix and so you spin up the local server, you click around on your own product on the front end and try to reproduce the bug yourself. Once you have the error, you take a look at Datadog and you see what happened and you try to find other errors in the logs. You look at those files and you see what went wrong, you make some edits, maybe you go and rerun the whole process again now that you make sure your change looks right. That's a lot of what it means to be a software engineer. These are processes that take real time. I think we're going to shift more and more towards this agentic workflow, because that's in some ways the way to really get to that 200%, 500%, 1000% gains that we'll be getting to with software engineering over the next few years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):
Enough talk. Let's show people what the heck this actually looks like. You've got a couple demos prepped that show a few use cases that you found helpful. You're going to pull up your screen and then we'll kick it off and then we'll talk as it's happening.

Scott Wu (00:34:52):
Yeah. The whole process obviously of working with Devin is working asynchronously. I thought it'd be cool for us to actually just watch Devin a little bit in action and then we can go through some other examples of work that Devin's done or things that Devin does for us, even on our team for example. But then we can check back in asynchronously with our Devin after. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):
Let's do it. 

Scott Wu (00:35:13):
I'll share this real quick. The key thing that I would just emphasize here is a lot of it obviously is really just about thinking about as a software engineer or as engineers ourselves or engineering teams, PMs, and so on. What are the things that we would want to build that we would want to hand off? We have Devin set up with our own Devin code base, for example, and so I'll go ahead and kick off with Devin for that. I'll just say, "Devin, I'm on with my friend, Lenny."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):
Hi, Devin.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02):
Today, I am super excited to bring you a very special episode with Shreyas Doshi, recorded live at the Lenny and Friends Summit in front of 1,000 people in San Francisco. This is Shreyas' second time on the podcast. His first visit is the third most popular episode of all time of this podcast, and I love that Shreyas was game to try this.

(00:20):
In our conversation, Shreyas shares three questions plus a bonus question that he wished he'd asked himself sooner in his career. We talk about why product leaders are so busy, why the job is so frustrating, why it is so central to build good taste, and also why you're probably not listening as well as you should be. This was so much fun, a huge thank you to Shreyas for doing this.

(00:41):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Shreyas Doshi (01:01):
Thanks, Lenny, for having me. This is amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04):
I was going to ask, we recorded our first episode, I think two years ago, and I was in a tiny room in my house. I don't know where you were, but it was very not like this. Thoughts on the setup of this episode?

Shreyas Doshi (01:18):
So first, the Lenny Empire keeps growing, which is amazing to see. And second, as I was coming up here, somebody told me this used to be a car dealership, and I actually realized I purchased my car here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34):
What?

Shreyas Doshi (01:36):
So crazy, only in SF.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38):
What kind of car was this? Say more.

Shreyas Doshi (01:40):
It was a Honda CR-V.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42):
Okay, wow. I am told this venue was also used for... Jimi Hendrix performed here, and Aretha Franklin performed here. So it's like Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Shreyas.

Shreyas Doshi (01:56):
There we go, that's going up on my Twitter bio soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02):
Okay, so usually, when we talk, you're full of ideas and you're full of answers. When we were preparing for this, you told me, "I have questions, I have questions I want to ask."

Shreyas Doshi (02:16):
You know, reflecting on my career as a PM leader over the years, there are some questions I wish I had asked myself sooner, but I did not, and I had the great luck of having a life, a PM life full of suffering, and I have zero complaints about it. But as I look back, I feel like there are some questions that even if I asked myself some questions, those questions, I wasn't honest to myself about the answers. So that's what I thought I'd do, is share the questions that I wish I'd asked myself sooner.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:05):
Awesome.

Shreyas Doshi (03:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:06):
Love that, okay. This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like, Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(03:41):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features, like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(04:29):
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native, customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Are native integrations on your product roadmap? Whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today.

(04:50):
But building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering, according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Coffee AI, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon, so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their Pro and Enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.

(05:37):
What's the first question?

Shreyas Doshi (05:39):
Right, so let's see, the first question is why am I so busy? Why am I so busy? And the background is that I have spent most of my career just being completely stressed out, just absolutely stressed out every day. And there were many reasons for it, but one of the core reasons was I was always super busy, and there was always work I felt like I couldn't do that I wanted to do, and so I would go home at the end of the day, and even if I had worked hard, I'd just feel dissatisfied.

(06:27):
And so that was a constant fixture of my life as a PM, PM leader, and it's only... So I did product work for about 20 years before I started this new chapter of my career. And I think I only fixed it in the last three or four years of my career as a PM leader. But that means that there were about 16 or 17 years where I was just incredibly busy, and because I was incredibly busy, I was extremely stressed, and even though I was doing a good job, I was not feeling very good inside. And then, that showed up in my body, like all sorts of pains and aches I realized were actually not physical pains and aches. They were pains and aches from the stress.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:15):
It's like health issues that you had?

Shreyas Doshi (07:16):
Yeah, yeah, minor stuff. I mean, relatively minor stuff, but playing tennis, and you pull your back muscle, and now you are horizontal for three days, doesn't feel good.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:31):
Who here is very, very busy, and is just way too busy? Raise your hand.

Shreyas Doshi (07:36):
That's it?

Lenny Rachitsky (07:36):
Yeah, I know.

Shreyas Doshi (07:37):
Whoa.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:39):
Everyone's like [inaudible 00:07:39] everybody. Yeah, people were like, "Yeah, yeah. I don't have to raise my hand, I'm busy." Yeah. Okay, keep going.

Shreyas Doshi (07:50):
Yeah, and so here's the thing, when we talk about being busy, and managing your time, energy, all of that, I mean, this is a group of senior product people, so you all know that. Take tips and techniques, like maintain a to-do list. I found the LNO framework very useful for me, which I've shared before. I used to like working out of a calendar, those types of things. And I think you're all familiar with those things, but what I wanted to call out is that, at some point in our product career, we reach something, we reach an immovable force that will just overwhelm us, no matter what we do.

(08:39):
And that force is a scope. Okay, so as we grow in our product career, our scope grows, and we kind of like that, which is all great, but at some point, if you haven't already gotten there, many of you have, but for those of you who haven't, you will get there, where your scope will be so large, that no matter what you do in terms of efficiency, whatever framework you use for prioritization, whatever framework or tool you use to manage your to-do list, whatever tools and techniques you use, whatever prioritization you do, your scope is so large that you are still going to be incredibly busy.

(09:21):
And so that's what I faced, like I was saying for the first about 16, 17 years of working on products, and only in the last 3 or 4 years was I able to kind of find some answers on how to deal with that scope. And so perhaps we can talk about that, what do you think?

Lenny Rachitsky (09:43):
Yeah, so you're basically saying there's all these productivity tricks, ways to do more faster. And no matter how many of these tools you've got, you are just going to take on more and more work, and they'll peter out? I'll say many of my most popular newsletters posts are, "Here's productivity tricks and tips." And so people are always looking for these. And I'm curious to hear where you go with this, of just like that is not the answer long term, there's a different approach?

Shreyas Doshi (10:08):
Yes, and so the challenge is the following. How many of you are going through some kind of annual planning right now or you're planning on going through annual planning? Please. Everybody loves annual planning, great. So let's take annual planning. If you are a high-level manager, leader within a company, what does your month look like? Or in some cases, unfortunately, what do your two or three months look like when you are going through annual planning? It's all these kind of spreadsheets to fill out, and meetings to have, and dependencies, and priorities, and stakeholders to meet, and so on. And so I noticed, for instance, that at some point, that was making me really busy, and then that was making me feel guilty now, because I had my team to look after and to support, and then I had product decisions to make and various other things, and I've gone on some planning retreat or whatever.

(11:15):
And there you go, you last four, five, six, weeks, does that sound familiar to folks? Yeah? Okay, so I noticed that I needed to change that at some point, and actually found a solution, again, late in my career, but I found a solution, because I asked myself this question, which is, "Why am I so busy? I'm doing all the efficiency things, I'm managing my to-do list like a champ. I have my calendar set up just right. I have my routine set up just right. I'm working out so that I'm engaged at work, I'm productive, I'm doing all of that. Why am I so busy? Oh, it's planning season, and that is supposed to take up four to six weeks." And this was at Stripe when I encountered this. So that is supposed to take up four to six weeks.

(12:03):
Well, I realized that you don't have to do that. And so at some point in my time at Stripe, what I realized is the following, we go through a whole all sorts of just rituals around planning for four to six weeks. Then, we emerge and we share our plan with our executives. You know the questions they're going to ask, like, "If money were no concern, what would you do? What is your ambitious plan? So if we gave you five more engineers, what would you do? What other things would you include in the roadmap?" Right? The standard stuff. And so you emerge, you do your presentation, and then you publish the plan, and then you start the new year with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement. And January goes fine, until you get three customer escalations for features that were not in your plan. And so now, you try to figure out how you're going to revise resources.

(13:03):
You go talk to some dependency team that's going to sort of support these new features from these customer escalations. And you go through that process, and you revise your plan again. And then, usually by the time it's last week of February, everybody's forgotten the actual plan. And now, we are executing off of some other list somewhere. And by the way, when you mention this at times, politely of course, you might mention like, "You know, I'm noticing we are not actually really using the plan that we spent four to six weeks minimum doing." And then, some smart person in the room chimes in with, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything."

(13:52):
I don't know, Eisenhower, somebody else, I don't know who said this, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything." Nobody knows what it means. Nobody knows what that means, but everybody appreciates, "Ah, plans are useless, but planning is everything." Right? So I went through a few years of this. And then I go, "You know what? I'm going to bend some rules here." And so what I realized, Lenny, is you don't have to go through these four to six weeks, and it was an accident. Basically, what happened is around that time, the product I was working on, Stripe Connect, it's like a major product for Stripe, major, major business for Stripe. And I had put together a product strategy, like a real product strategy for this product.

(14:44):
And so this must have been earlier in the year. And so now, planning season came along. And the interesting I found is that because I had a real product strategy, not one of those fake ones, a real product strategy that I had gotten alignment on with everybody, my planning for this major product for Stripe took me like three days. Right, so while a lot of my peers, unfortunately, for their own products, were in this four-to-six week cycle of planning, and meeting, and blah, blah, blah, I just put it all together in three days, and whatever artifacts were needed, I put them together.

(15:27):
I did not fill out some templates. That's where it's about bending the rules, because if a template doesn't make sense, why should I fill it out? There's no need to fill it out. And so that's when I realized that actually, if you have a real product strategy, a real one that everybody is aligned with, that you have got pre-alignment on, then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away. Now, you still have to do some resource allocation and all of that, but even there, you don't need that false precision. How many of you have gotten into arguments about, "So should it be eight engineers for this team in 2025, or nine engineers for this team in 2025?"

(16:11):
Like, who cares? We all know that even those numbers that we set up, we don't actually follow through on them, as 2025 happens. So that's just an example of where we spend a lot of time on things that we think are strategic, that we think are important, but actually, we ought to spend that time on other much higher leverage things. Right, now it does require some upfront work, in this case upfront work on a clear product strategy that everybody understands, that everybody's aligned on. But frankly, if you have that, planning should be a breeze.

Lenny Rachitsky (16:49):
So what would be your kind of tactical tip for folks that want to do this better? I know there's probably a billion examples of these sorts of things you shared, so planning is an example. Folks that want to be less busy, maybe on that one is it give yourself very little time, and focus on strategy, and let that be the plan, basically, versus every single person and their roadmap for the next six months. What's the piece of advice you'd share there? And then, I want to move on to the next question, because I want to make sure we get through all these questions.

Shreyas Doshi (17:18):
Yes, there's definitely a specific tip, which is if you do have a strategy that will make a lot of your prioritization problems go away, it will make a lot of planning problems go away. And even if you do have some escalation from sales, which you will, or from support, or somewhere else, you now have at least a more rigorous framework to figure out what to do with that escalation. So there's definitely that.

(17:48):
But I think other thing I want to share is that, and this was my other realization as I asked the question, "Why am I so busy?" is I realized that I am so busy because I'm not making good product decisions. Okay, now, you have to understand, by this time I'm like 15 years into building products and whatever, 11 years into being a product manager. And so I think I'm pretty good. That's my kind of self-image. But then, again, if I'm being honest to myself, I'm not making as good product decisions as I can. So can I share an example of that?

Lenny Rachitsky (18:32):
Please.

Shreyas Doshi (18:34):
So what I noticed is that you have a meeting about some product feature that somehow is requested or is really important, whatever the case might be. And so you have a meeting with some stakeholders and your engineering team, designers, et cetera. And then, you're trying to decide, "Should we build this or not?" And somebody says, "You know what? Why are we doing a meeting for this?" I read somewhere or I heard Bezos say that two-way doors, it's a two-way door. You quickly make a decision. Like, just quickly make a decision and move on. This is a two-way door. And so you say, "Yeah, that's right." And any time we hear something like that, two-way door, you're like, "Oh, that person's really smart, so I want to be like them."

(19:32):
So I noticed that myself and my team, we were making these kinds of decisions without very clearly thinking through customer motivation, very clearly thinking through differentiation, very clearly thinking through a distribution approach for whatever this feature is. And while it sounds like, "Oh, of course you should be doing this," I guarantee you this is not how most product teams work. They're talking about, "Well, is Bob the engineer going to be free? And when are they free? And if they are free, then let's build the feature." That's kind of how a lot of product decisions happen.

(20:11):
The challenge here with this kind of approach, and again, this is what happens in practice, I'm not talking about whatever theory you read, this is what happens in practice. So when you follow this approach and you assume that, "Oh, this is a two-way door, we can kill the feature," in reality, it doesn't work out that way, because here's what happens in reality. So in reality, you commit to the feature, and it's going to take five, six weeks to do it, and then a couple more weeks to make sure, to ramp it up, et cetera, right? And so now the feature is out, and now you have your Q1 QBR, right? Say two months from now you have your Q1 QBR, and you're going to present your business review, whatever. You're going to present what you did, "What did you do last quarter? How are your ships performing from last quarter?"

(21:03):
And so now, it's time to talk about this feature at the QBR, because you have to share that/ Now as you start talking about this feature, the CEO will ask, "So yeah, we launched the feature. I'm very glad we launched this feature. How is it doing?" And you want to be able to say, you are the PM leader, you want to be able to say something smart, and something that makes you look competent. But the challenge is the feature hasn't had much adoption. So I'm not going to ask anybody to raise hands, but I think most PMs are familiar with this conundrum. And of course, we are verbally very agile as product leaders. So what we say is we don't have data, so we use favorable anecdotes.

(21:53):
And so we say, "Yeah, we launched the feature, and you know what? This customer from this company really loves the feature." And we put in an anecdote, it's like, "Life-changing feature." It doesn't matter that they're the only person using it. That doesn't matter. "Life-changing feature," right? We use data when it favors us, we use anecdotes when it favors us. So anyway, so we present that. Now. we do have the sales counterpart in the room too, our sales counterpart, and they say, "You know what, though? We are still not winning many deals because of this feature." And so of course the CEO asks, "So what's up? Why aren't we winning deals, even though we have the feature?"

(22:30):
So the people on the customer side usually we respond, "Well, I'm glad we have the feature, but it's not full featured yet. We need all these other bells and whistles to meet the table stakes." So now, what happens? Somebody uttered the word, "Meet the table stakes." Now, it's over for you, because now, the only response you can give is, "Oh, yeah, that's already part of the plan." And now, you put your engineering leader on the spot and you say, "Alice, isn't it? Haven't we allocated engineers to it already?" And so now, Alice has to come up with some response, which is like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, Carol and David are going to work on it. It's slotted for one of these sprints."

(23:19):
And so now, you exit the QBR, you high-five each other. Well, "Good job, team, great job," et cetera, et cetera. But now, you have signed up for even more work for a feature you should not have built in the first place. That's why we're busy. And through a product leader's life, what happens is we just accumulate all of this debt, feature after feature. So I guess what I'm saying, Lenny, is one of my other tactical tips would be sometimes it is useful to pause for two minutes, or two days, or two weeks before making that decision, right? Because frankly, most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos' level, but as a PM leader, for you, they are a one-way door, and that's making you busy.

Lenny Rachitsky (24:18):

(25:21):
I know it's Spotify, I heard one of their core values is, "Talk is cheap," but it's the virtue version of that. It's like, they actually prefer to talk more, and I think that's exactly what you're saying. Basically, spend more time on these things that seemingly seem just small little ideas and experiments.

Shreyas Doshi (25:37):
Yep, thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:41):
Amazing. Shreyas, what's your second question?

Shreyas Doshi (25:45):
Yes. So my second question, I have to get the words right, do I actually have good taste? Do I actually have good taste is my second question. And for me, I asked this question after, again, all of these things... By the way, everything I say, I have been that guy, I've made that mistake. So that's why I just have to admit to myself that, yes, I have made these mistakes. And one of the mistakes I made, this was when I was at Google, and I was relatively new to product, about less than five years. And at Google, there's some parts of Google where you would be told as an early career PM that like, "We don't do strategy here. Strategy is for MBAs, okay? We are all about execution, okay?"

(26:47):
So I'm in this environment, I'm naïve, and I look around me and I'm like, "Google is the most successful company on the planet," at the time, and they are saying this, and I'm hearing this consistently, so it must be right. It must be right. And so I start saying it. I start saying, "Oh, yeah, execution is everything, and we don't do strategy around here." And I even remember there were not that many PMs, but there was a PM at Google who was kind of like the same level as me, but he just had much more wisdom than me. And he was trying to nudge me into... Like, I was managing a product. And he's like, "Shreyas, what is your strategy here?" And I was like, I told him the same thing. Like, "Oh, no, no, what are you talking strategy? We don't need strategy. We just need to get shit done." That was the thing.

(27:42):
And so I kept repeating that mantra until I got to Twitter. So this is Twitter right after their IPO. And I saw Twitter had an incredible asset, which is the product and the network effects. It had other incredible assets, including the brand. It had other assets that were great, including the talent. And yet, this company was struggling, the product was struggling. And even if it wasn't struggling, it was making a lot of money. But the point is it was not meeting its potential. So that's when I realized, and it wasn't like some sudden realization, it took me six to nine months of being at Twitter. This is circa 2014. That's when I realized that, "Oh, my gosh, Twitter's biggest problem is a product strategy problem. The reason they're struggling is they don't have a real product strategy."

(28:38):
Now, of course, attempts were made to create a product strategy, but it wasn't a real compelling, cohesive product strategy. So that's when I realized the folly of like, "Oh, wait a minute..." I was at Google six years. I spent most of those six years saying like, "Ah, strategy's useless. There's no point to strategy. Execution is where it's at. "I'm like, "No, actually, I was wrong." And that got further solidified as I went to Stripe, and I was kind of now growing earlier stage products and trying to make them highly, highly successful. I saw an even greater value and importance of having a clear strategy. And so that made me realize, basically...

(29:29):
You know, we talk about taste, we all talk about taste, and it's about the beautiful pixels, and the perfect product, and the whatever else, the Steve Jobs-esque passion, and all of that, whatever it is. And yes, taste is about that, but I think there is something that we as product leaders, and certainly I did, needed to recognize about taste as just a factor in pretty much everything we do, which is like, do we have good taste around the beliefs we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders? And then, those beliefs end up dictating everything we do, including how we manage, how we lead, how we make decisions. And so it's that taste I'm talking about when I say, "Do I really have good taste?"

(30:28):
And when I asked myself this question, and again, I really had to dig deep. It wasn't easy, but at some point I realized that no, actually, I don't have good taste. I don't have good taste in how I choose to evaluate things that come my way. Again, not in terms of the product, because by that time I had skills to say, "Well, this should not be a two-step flow. This should be a three-step flow," whatever the case may be. But I still did not have good taste in terms of how I choose what are the things I choose to believe, how do I learn, who do I learn from, what content I learned from, what content I resonate with? And then, I went on this journey to try to develop that better taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:21):
What I'm hearing is people focus maybe too much on the output, like the experience, these experience design taste versus what they choose to take in as informing their taste, and what they see as an example of great and correct. Is that what you're saying?

Shreyas Doshi (31:37):
Yeah. And look, taste is about the ability to identify what is really good, without needing to see its results, because, look, it requires zero taste right now for anybody to say, "Oh, that CEO of NVIDIA is a genius, right? Jensen is a genius." If you are saying that in 2024, it actually requires zero taste, because you can just look up NVIDIA stock price. It requires zero skill. But to be able to say that in 2010, you have to realize Jensen Huang didn't change much between 2010 and 2024. So Lenny, even in sports, there's this saying, "Game recognize game," and that's about taste.

(32:59):
But what we need to understand is it's game recognize game before the game is called, right? Like, game recognize game in the practice session. Because it takes no genius right now to say, "Well, Patrick Mahomes is great quarterback," or, "Virat Kohli is a great cricketer," or whatever else. It requires no genius to do that. It requires zero taste. So I also believe some of us, especially as we get more senior, and we get more successful, and we just get a lot more scope, and responsibility, and a lot of accolades, we become these tough graders. Like, "I don't like anything," right? Like, "Ah, this is crap, this is crap, this is crap." Again, that requires zero taste. Anybody can say that. Anybody can just say, "Everything is horrible."

(33:53):
So I do think there is something about being able to understand that, and I think I'll share some examples. This two-way door thing, so let me just share a few observations, if I might. So the first one is we get overly excited about cool metaphors, okay? Like, one-way door, two-way doors. There's some guy, I don't know who it is, I just read somewhere, there's some guy who had written a blog post about this idea, but he called it reversible and irreversible decisions, and it was the same idea. And I think somebody was lamenting that that did not catch on, reversible and irreversible decisions. But what caught on is two-way door and one-way door. What's the difference? The only difference is you got attracted to the catchy metaphor, and the other one is the authority bias, because Bezos said it.

(34:58):
Take another example, we get very impressed with alliterations. I'm serious, we get very impressed with alliterations. Okay, so how many of us love fail fast? Fail fast, okay, nobody's going to raise hands now. Okay, fine. Maybe you truly don't love fail fast. How about fast follow? How many of you love fast follow? Let's consider that, like fail fast, "We're going to fail fast." What if that thing were called fail quickly? It's the same meaning. Do you think you would be as attracted to that idea if it were called fail quickly?

Lenny Rachitsky (35:44):
No.

Shreyas Doshi (35:46):
Probably not, so what changed? The only thing that changed is one is an alliteration. So I see this in everything. Like, let's see, the other one is we also get very impressed with complicated charts and math we don't understand. And some of you product leaders who are at the top of the game, you actually use this as a strategy. So as I realized that here's the outcome of that, asking myself that question, was that what I realized is everybody says, "Oh, I'm a first principle thinker. I am a rigorous thinker," whatever.

(36:41):
But I realized that if I really want to be that, I have to shed a lot of these just patterns that were just built in me, and I kind of have to evaluate the idea separate from all of its social proof, and authority proof, and whatever else. And that ended up being a meaningful change in my growth as a product leader, because the moment I started shedding these kinds of social proofs, and authority proofs, and all of that, it just made me a much... We all again think we are critical thinkers, but we are not, right? So it made me a more critical thinker.

Lenny Rachitsky (37:31):
I want to move on to the next question, just so we can get through some of these questions. Before I do, can you just show people your notes real quick, just like show it from a distance? This is how Shreyas plans for something like this. There's color coding, I wish I understood what was going on there.

Shreyas Doshi (37:49):
People ask me, "What's your favorite note-taking app?" It's a common question I get, and I say this, right? It's a $5... Like I guess the pen costs $3, and I think the Office Depot clipboard costs-

Lenny Rachitsky (38:00):
Wait, doesn't that pen... Does it have the different color clicky thing?

Shreyas Doshi (38:02):
Yes, yes, yeah. A [inaudible 00:38:04]. Yeah, exactly. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:06):
That's going to be another podcast episode. Okay, so we want to try to do two more questions. We have six minutes left. The last one's a bonus, so maybe we touch on it briefly. Shreyas, what's your third question?

Shreyas Doshi (38:18):
So my third question is why does my job feel so frustrating? Why does my job feel so frustrating? And it goes back to the point that, look, I loved, loved my PM leadership job. I just absolutely loved it. And I think looking back, I would not have exchanged it for anything else, any other experience. That said, there were daily frustrations. There were daily frustrations in that job, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that the PM leader's job is extremely lonely. The PM's job, the PM's on your team, their job is also lonely. But a PM leader's job is further lonelier. So there's that. There's also what I learned at the time when I started asking this question is that our jobs get frustrating when we behave, most of the time, in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core.

(39:32):
Okay, so for me, as I was evaluating that question, it's like, "Why am I getting frustrated every day? I love the job, I love the macro, but I do not like the micro. And so why is that?" And that's when I actually... There's a simple framework that I've shared, which is you can be doing your work at three levels. Product work happens at three levels. There's the impact level, there's the execution level, and there's the optics level. My epiphany as I was exploring this question was I have a preferred level at which I like to operate, but if most of the day, and most of the week, and most of the month, I am forcing myself to operate in not my happy place, in my non-default level, that makes me very frustrated.

(40:33):
So many product leaders, their happy place is the execution level. In my case, my happy place is the impact level. So that is fine. Your happy place can be whatever level, it doesn't matter. But the point is, as you go higher up in the corporate ladder, no matter what kind of company it is, you are now going to have to spend a lot of time on optics, at the optics level. And I have willpower, I have the skills to do it, I have all of that. So it's not about willpower or skills, but willpower is finite. So as I spent day in and day out, just mostly doing optics work, I realized I was not happy and I was getting frustrated. And so that's when I realized the solution, which is I have to abandon the traditional path, that like, "Oh, after this level, I'm supposed to do this, and then I'm supposed to do this, and then this is what society expects. This is what my mom expects. What will people say on LinkedIn when they see my LinkedIn profile?" Like, "Oh, he has this progression, this, and then what stopped? Why did it stop?"

(41:49):
So when I realized this, I said, when a team grew to a certain size, so when I was at Stripe and I realized this, when the team I was managing, it had a fan out of about 50 people, so this includes engineers and everything, I said, "This is enough." Because for me, any time a team goes to like 50s, and 100s, and beyond, it is a law of corporations that you're going to have to spend a lot of time at the optics level. So instead of just pushing, pushing through against who I truly am, what did I do? I just went back to more of an earlier stage product, and then I was fine with like, "You know what? I'm not going to just play the corporate game," as an example.

(42:34):
So I guess my suggestion would be identify your superpowers, and like Shakespeare said, "To thine own self be true." Just be honest to yourself. Operate your career and make your career decisions not out of expectation, not out of envy, like the LinkedIn envy of like, "Oh, this person is at a different level. We both went to the same grad school, so I got..." No, identify your superpowers, because if you identify your superpowers and work in accordance with them, you will do the best work of your life. You will love it, and you will be great at it, and you won't have that frustration.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:23):
I wish we had an hour for every single one of these questions, I feel like there's so much more to get into. We have 40 seconds. Do you want to touch on your last question or do you want to leave that for a follow-up discussion?

Shreyas Doshi (43:35):
Let's touch on it, let's touch on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:37):
Okay, we got to go though in 30 seconds.

Shreyas Doshi (43:38):
All right. My last question is am I really listening? Okay, and this is perhaps the hardest one for me, because I thought, of course I'm a good listener because I listen, then I recap, and I make eye contact, and I tell them, "This is what I heard," And all of that nonsense. I realized there is an entirely other level to listening, which once you understand that there's an entirely other level to listening, that is what enables you to be a world-class leader. And so that is what I guess my last takeaway is, is ask yourself, "Am I really listening?" If you want resources, there are very few people who actually talk about what that real listening means. I would refer you to what Rick Rubin says about listening, I would refer you to what [inaudible 00:44:30] said about listening, and what Drucker said about listening as some pointers.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:36):
Amazing. Shreyas, you said you were going to hang out for the next hour somewhere. You want to share that real quick, and then we'll get off?

Shreyas Doshi (44:42):
Yes, I will maybe try to hang out in the back part of the room.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:46):
Be quiet back there, too.

Shreyas Doshi (44:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:47):
Shreyas, thank you so much for being here.

Shreyas Doshi (44:50):
Great, thank you. Oh, should we take a picture?

Lenny Rachitsky (44:54):
Oh, yeah. We're going to take a quick selfie.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
We're going to take a picture.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:59):
There we go. They're going to turn lights on, I think.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
Oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:00):
Okay.

Shreyas Doshi (45:03):
All right, folks.

# Why ChatGPT will be the next big growth channel (and how to capitalize on it) | Brian Balfour

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Everyone's always complaining SEO's dead, it can't grow. Word of mouth is so hard. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:03):
All of the ingredients for new distribution platform are essentially happening. My prediction, the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT. There's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
This is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:16):
It ends up being a prisoner's dilemma. Don't trick yourself into thinking that you can't play the game. The cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time. If you don't do it, your competitors are going to go to the new platform and your customer expectations change. There is no opting out of the game. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
This is the opportunity to disrupt an incumbent. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:33):
If you're a late-stage company, you place multiple bets. For startups, it's a totally different ballgame. You have to choose one and go all in. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Think about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies.

Brian Balfour (00:00:43):
Building a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient. And actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
What would be the backup if not ChatGPT? 

Brian Balfour (00:00:54):
My hypothesis of who's best-positioned would actually be...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Today, my guest is Brian Balfour. Brian is the founder and CEO of Reforge, a company that I've been a long-time fan and advocate of. Historically, Reforge has focused primarily on teaching courses on product and growth, but more recently they've transitioned to building their own products, including a product called Reforge Insights and a bunch more really cool stuff coming very soon. 

(00:01:18):
Prior to Reforge, Brian led growth at HubSpot, and over the course of his career, he has seen the rise and fall of every major distribution channel, including Facebook's ad platform, Google Ads and SEO, and the Apple App Store. Based on what he's seeing, he is predicting the emergence of a brand new and powerful distribution channel that will likely arise in the next six months, centered most likely around ChatGPT. It is really rare for a new growth channel to open up. It's been a long time since the last one appeared, and the people who recognize this and hop on it early are the ones that reap the most rewards. So this is a huge deal. 

(00:01:54):
In this conversation, Brian shares what he's predicting, what he's seeing, why this is a big deal, and what you should be doing about it right now. I highly recommend you listen to this full conversation and discuss the ramifications with your team.

Brian Balfour (00:04:09):
Yeah, thanks for having me. Excited for this one. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):
I'm really excited to have you back. We're just going to dive right in. Essentially, you've uncovered a really important trend or insight about how products are going to grow differently in the future, how growth is changing, and this is something that I think a lot of people need to hear, so I asked you to come on to share what you're seeing. I also think this is just very timely. I think you said you're going to say in the next six months things might significantly change, so I'm really excited to do this. We're going to spend this whole conversation on this insight. To set us up, what is just the big idea? What's the high-level idea here? 

Brian Balfour (00:04:45):
Just like you, I've spent my whole career just really passionate about startups, figuring out how to build products that win, that emerge in new markets, and one of the things that I have learned over time or one of the things you hear a lot from a lot of folks is, to win, you have to really build a great product. A lot of advice boils down to that. And one of the things that I feel like I've banged my head against the wall in a lot of ways in my career is actually telling people that building a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient, and actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution. 

(00:05:26):
So this general partner, his name's Alex Rampell, he's at Andreessen Horowitz, actually wrote this blog post 10 years ago back in I think 2015. In the essence of the blog post, he basically says one thing, which is that startups is a game of trying to get distribution before the incumbent can copy. It's this kind of concept of escape philosophy. 

(00:05:54):
On that note, which I think os a very good summary of what you're trying to do in a startup and distribution, is that we're right now living in this environment where that game of startups getting distribution faster than the incumbent has gotten way harder in a lot of ways, and in some small cases has gotten a little bit easier. But if we think about this, the way that it's gotten harder and some of the things that probably a lot of founders or folks working on the growth side that probably feel is that, one is that incumbents can copy faster these days. That window that you have to get that escape velocity has actually shrunk. It's decreased. 

(00:06:34):
The second thing is that a lot of the organic distribution that we've had, especially over the past few years, has really shrunk as well. Everybody's talking about the decline of SEO and clicks declining, but you also see it in some other cases. A lot of these social platforms don't really let you send as much traffic to sites. LinkedIn just changed their algorithm, which has really dropped organic distribution. Obviously the Twitter-to-X, transition that happened, right? TikTok's almost always been like that.

(00:07:06):
And then the third way that it's gotten harder is that AI's really good at writing software and code generation, and so everybody's feeling this infinite increase of competition, especially at the startup level. YC is pumping out six of the same thing every single cohort. That's what it literally feels like. 

(00:07:23):
So it's gotten way harder. This game, this escape velocity game has gotten a lot harder. It's gotten easier in some very exceptional cases like the Cursor or something where AI has been like the spark. I know you wrote the blog post about the race car engine, and I think you said there's the spark plug in the engine. AI really created that, a new type of spark, a new type of interest of early adopters to fuel some new players in a short period of time. So it's amazing to see something like Cursor overtake market share of something like GitHub Copilot in nine months or less. That's how fast it happens. It's kind of crazy. 

(00:08:01):
But the main thing that people need to understand is, okay, well, if that's the game I'm playing, how to get to escape velocity before the incumbent? What are all the ways to do that and to really figure that out? There's multiple ways that this can happen, but one of the major ways, one of the major, major ways that we always see is that this can happen when new distribution platforms emerge, because when new distribution platforms emerge, startups are usually the fastest to take advantage of them. It's slower for the incumbents to move. It gives startups this opportunity essentially to play this game. 

(00:08:39):
Casey Winters wrote this blog post about two years ago, maybe 18 months ago, about the AI technology shift. His key point was the AI technology shift has been a technology shift that has not come with a distribution shift yet. If you look historically, we've had a bunch of technology shifts from the internet to the cloud to mobile to social, all of these different types of things. Some of them come with new distribution platforms, new ways to distribute products, and some of them don't, but the most powerful ones, the most impactful ones are the ones that do come with these new distribution platforms. His second key point was that these two things don't actually happen at once. Usually you get the technology shift, then you get the distribution shift a little bit later. 

(00:09:25):
Now we're a couple years from that post. We are a couple years into AI technology shift, and one of the things that I am seeing is all of the conditions, all of the ingredients for a new distribution platform to emerge are essentially happening. So I think we're at an inflection point where we're going to see this emerge really fast. 

(00:09:45):
The key thing for everybody to know is that as new distribution platforms emerge, they follow the same four-step cycle and it's a game that you're playing, that everybody's playing. Just like any game, you need to know the rules of the game. You need to know the steps of the game in order to have any sort of opportunity to win. That's the thing that I've lived through once again, both painfully and also in good ways, and is something that I'm keeping my eye on and something that I've been talking about. Before we go into that four-step cycle, I figured I'll pause there to see if you have any follow-up questions on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Okay. This is amazing. Essentially what you're saying is we follow these ways to grow, there's SEO, there's paid growth, there's sales. All these channels have been around for a long time. They're extremely saturated. Everyone's always complaining SEO's dead, it can't grow, the SEO, anymore. It can't grow. Word of mouth is so hard, there's so many amazing things now that's hard. Paid is so hard. It's just all this money just-

Brian Balfour (00:10:24):
Tax are rising.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Exactly.

Brian Balfour (00:10:49):
All these things. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
So all these saturated channels, and what you're saying is there's an emerging new channel that has not yet been saturated, and this is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. And you'll talk about timing because it's a little tricky to even know exactly when to go big on this.

Brian Balfour (00:11:05):
That's right. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:06):
But that's a huge deal. This has been a long time since there's a new way to grow that you can actually use as a lever for growth and not just hope for the best. Okay.

Brian Balfour (00:11:15):
Yeah. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):
Before you get into the cycles, do you want to tease what the answer is, just to give people a little hint, or do you want to keep it secret?

Brian Balfour (00:11:23):
Well, to be clear, okay, so my prediction, we don't have a clear winner yet. My prediction of the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT, in some ways that people probably already think it's happening in some ways that it won't, but the thing that is less important or that is more important than whether I have predicted the exact winner correctly, the thing that's more important is to understand the cycle and evaluate how to determine where you want to place your bets and how to place those bets, which I know we'll talk about.

(00:12:02):
I could be wrong about the ChatGPT prediction and what's going to happen there. I think there's going to be two parts of it. There's going to be what they do with a ChatGPT search experience, but I think the bigger thing will be whatever they do with launching a third-party platform on top of ChatGPT, there's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that, I'm pretty sure it's going to be ChatGPT. 

(00:12:25):
The thing I'm way more sure about is that some new distribution platform will emerge and it will follow the same four-step cycle. That's the key. Could be wrong on the first piece, I am very confident on the second piece.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:40):
Okay. Excellent foreshadowing. I completely agree, if it's anything, it would be ChatGPT at this point. Let's get into it. What are the cycles that platforms generally follow? 

Brian Balfour (00:12:49):
Yeah, and I'll give some examples of this, but let me explain the four steps of the cycle first and then we'll go through a bunch of examples of all those individual steps. The four steps are essentially, one is I call a Step Zero. It's the conditions of the market have been met. Step One is about a moat, Step Two is about a platform opening, and Step Three is about the platform closing for control and monetization. Let me briefly explain each one. 

(00:13:20):
Step Zero is about the competitive market being met, the conditions being met, and there's a few part piece of this. One is that typically what happens is that there is consensus that there is going to be this new huge category. Think social, think mobile, like all those types of things. In this case, these AI like chat platforms, like a ChatGPT or a clock. There's consensus about that, but there's no clear winner yet. We typically have somewhere between five to seven major players really battling it out and they're all looking for what is the edge? What is the thing that is going to help me win? Because all of these dynamics, in all the history, they either end up in monopolies or duopolies, and so the stakes are really large and so the competition is fierce. 

(00:14:13):
That's Step Zero. I think we could all agree that we are in that mode right now. We've got OpenAI battling with Claude, battling with Gemini, and Google with whatever Meta comes out with their new team, so on and so forth. There's huge amounts of capital, there's consensus, all the types. They are in a fierce composition. That's Step Zero.

(00:14:36):
Step One is then these players, somebody essentially identifies whatever the moat is, the thing that is going to help build them defensibility and help them hit escape velocity and become that monopoly or duopoly in that single category. Once they figure out what that moat is, then they need to press the advantage. They need to figure out how to gather that moat as fast as humanly possible. It tends to be that you can't do that by yourself, so you need the help of an ecosystem in order to gather more of that moat. 

(00:15:12):
That typically comes down to third-party content creators or app developers and other businesses. So they all establish a third-party platform that has some incentives built in, and usually the value exchange is, hey, you develop on top of my platform, you add more use cases, more engagement, all of these things to my platform, and in exchange, I'm going to give you something in return. Usually that thing that's in exchange is, I'm going to give you some new form of distribution for your application and for your business.

(00:15:48):
But what essentially happens over time is that we go into Step Three, which is the closing period, which is at some point, all of these companies end up starting to lock down the platform. This tends to happen for reasons of monetization and growth. They either competitively don't want somebody to use their own platform to disrupt themselves. We saw that in the early Twitter days with things like Vine and Periscope, shutting those things down unceremoniously, or they need to find ways to monetize at a deeper and deeper level because all these companies, they have to grow. 

(00:16:32):
Google's the classic example here of just more and more real estate has either been taken up by either ads or their own first-party applications. That's the key is they close it down by doing by one of a few things. They either shut it down entirely, two, they develop their own first-party applications to absorb the highest use cases, or three, they artificially depress the organic distribution that they gave you in the step prior to push you towards paid mechanisms in order to monetize. I think we should go through multiple examples here, but that's the core essence of the four steps. I'll pause there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):
Awesome. So it's essentially figure out what's going to make, create defensibility long-term with your moat, bring everyone in, "Hey, everyone, welcome to Facebook," everyone joins Facebook and then, okay, and all the developers build on Facebook to bring in more people on Facebook and then they're like, "Okay, now you got to pay. There's a toll," but you love this so much and you're so hooked to all your friends that you're here, you may as well stick around. 

Brian Balfour (00:17:35):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:35):
Amazing. Okay, so yeah, a few examples would be great. 

Brian Balfour (00:17:38):
Yeah. You just hit on the first one. This is the first one that I always think about because this is where I learned about this cycle very early in my career. One of my first companies was during the Facebook platform boom, social gaming, all of those applications, and I lived the full cycle in a very short period. I lived the glory days and just the absolute horror days, and it was very painful, but this is exactly what happened. 

(00:18:06):
Let's go through the four steps. Step Zero. Facebook was in a brutal battle with MySpace, Friendster and a few others. People forget this. People forget that there was actually a bunch of competitors at that time, and in fact those competitors were bigger than Facebook. They had more users back in 2007 when Facebook launched their third-party platform. But one of the key things is that Facebook was very early to the insight about the direct network effects in that there's going to create real lock-in that the more friends, the more of the global network that was on there, the more that it was just going to feed and hit this escape velocity.

(00:18:44):
At the time they launched their platform, I think they were maybe one-fourth, one-fifth the size of something like MySpace or even Friendster, Orkut, these are some of the names at that time, but they opened up their third-party platform. What was the value exchange? They went to third-party developers and they said, "Okay, we've created this canvas," they used to call it the canvas, and they were like, "You can put anything in the canvas that you want: an app, a game, whatever. You can monetize in any way you want. We just want this sidebar real estate on the ads. That's what we're really interested in." There was this mad gold rush on that Facebook. 

(00:19:24):
Oh, sorry, the other part of that was, "Not only will you put it there, we're going to give you access to all of these notification channels and feed to get distribution for your application." That was the other piece of it. You had this mad rush of developers coming in and you had this huge social application, social gaming boom. People just grew incredibly virally very fast, but eventually, essentially what happened over time is they kept peeling back that value exchange. 

(00:19:52):
They first were like, "Ah, actually those dollars that you're making inside that canvas area, well, we want a percentage of that." So they changed that. And then they figured out their ad systems and then they started peeling back. They started suppressing access to all of the organic channels that they had. Eventually, they went all the way towards absorbing the highest use case into their own first-party platform, things like first-party applications, things like events, photos, all those types of things, and basically shut down the platform for dead. 

(00:20:30):
These companies that have basically built on top of this platform, the other thing is by the time they started closing all those things down, all those competitors that we talked about, they were so far ahead at that point because they had built off the back of all these developers coming, adding use cases, bringing more users onto the platform, identifying that moat. They were so far ahead, it didn't matter. It didn't matter what the other folks did at that point, and that's what really gives you confidence to start closing down. But there's so many other examples of this if we go through it. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
Just before you give other examples, just something I'll highlight here. One is the moat they identified in theory was the friend graph, I imagine?

Brian Balfour (00:21:02):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):
Just once we have all your friends, you're not going to want to go anywhere. I imagine it's also important to note, this is a natural thing that would happen if you build the thing and it grows and you're like, "Oh, maybe we should change strategy." I imagine not everyone even knows this is what will happen and they organically evolve their strategy, or do you think everyone's just like, "This is now going to be our plan, Step 1, 2, 3, 4?"

Brian Balfour (00:21:32):
I think a different version of that question is I think some people could sit here and interpret this as all these folks are evil. That's not what I'm saying. That's actually not what I'm saying. I want to be very clear on that, because I think this cycle happens because of competitive and capitalistic dynamics and pressures. It's the same environment that enables creating amazing new companies here in the US. 

(00:22:01):
And there's two sides of the coin. You go through this cycle because it's a competitive environment. You're trying to figure out how to beat competitors, and this is one of the strategies to beat competitors. But at some point you just have to continue growing. You have to grow those dollars. The market does not reward flat companies, if anybody's noticed. You have to keep growing, and so they have to keep finding ways to grow as well as prevent their own disruption. TThey can get so big and they can give access, so much access of distribution to new developers, they don't want to enable their own disruption as well as they need to keep growing. 

(00:22:38):
My guess is anybody who is sitting in their shoes owning their platform is going to follow the exact same playbook and the exact same reasoning. Look, sometimes it happens also because it actually is the best thing for the user. Facebook's channels did get super spammy and all of those things, and that was part of the reason they'd play this, but let's be honest, it wasn't the only reason. A lot of it was for these other reasons. I don't think it's evil. You just need to know how to play the game. That's competition, that's business. They're playing you, so you need to play them. That might be a little sadistic or something, but that is business. You're in a game of competition.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):
Essentially, the incentives are pointing you in this direction. Capitalism, they say capitalism works, and so it'll pull everyone in this direction even if maybe they want to avoid it. Let's do a couple more examples.

Brian Balfour (00:23:33):
Yeah, we'll go through them quick. I think everybody's probably... Google's an interesting one because it played out over a much longer period of time. Facebook happened over the course of about in five-ish years, something like that. Google did it very slowly over years, but same thing, early massive competition against Yahoo, I don't know, AltaVista, Lycos, you name them all. That was even before my time. They were first to really identify these data moats and incentivizing essentially web developers, content folks to optimize for their search algorithms, create this great distribution mechanism. Everybody's building content and everything for them, but over time, slowly but surely they did two things. 

(00:24:19):
One is more and more that real estate became ads that they were monetizing, so they're suppressing organic distribution in order to push people towards the ads, as well as absorbing a bunch of the highest value first-party use cases, things like travel as an example, or even restaurant search and all those types of things. The former Yelp CEO and founder has been out there saying a lot of things about these practices. So, same exact cycle.

(00:24:48):
Mobile went through the exact same cycle. iOS created a new distribution mechanism. They had a ton of competition among different phones when they first started on. They found the defensibility was more about the apps, the data and all the developers, created the App Store, all of these types of things, but over time, we've seen more and more restrictions there on that front. 

(00:25:09):
And then most recently, we've seen this happen in smaller places, too. LinkedIn, as an example, first went through this wave with company pages. They were like, "Ah, companies, come on, promote your company page. Bring in more users, all that type of stuff, and then get all these followers." And then of course you get almost no distribution now through your company page because they're pushing you towards ads. And then they recently just did this with personal profiles, too, which is they really boosted distribution for individuals to create content for that platform. They then introduced the thought leader ad format, a way to monetize those individual posts, and now you've seen them really pull back on that organic distribution. 

(00:25:52):
So this happens in big forms and it happens even in smaller use cases as well, but once again, the steps of the cycle are exactly the same. The key part about this, too, is that the broad trend is that the cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time to play the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
Okay, and the big a-ha here is, yes, this will end maybe not great for you, but there's this magical period when they're open to customers and users where you can grow like crazy because they want everyone to come and they give you a distribution. What you're saying essentially is ChatGPT, potentially some other platform, maybe is about to enter this moat.

Brian Balfour (00:26:35):
Yeah. Well, before we get to ChatGPT, I think the natural reaction when you first realize this is, "Screw them, I'm not playing that game." That's what I feel like most people, how they react. Because the unfortunate truth is that a lot of companies don't predict that last stage and end up in a really hard position. So many companies got completely killed during the crash of the Facebook social platform. Apple's 30% tax basically destroyed a bunch of types of applications and business models because you feel like it just wasn't margin-effective. So many companies built on SEO loops that are in serious, serious trouble right now if that's their only channel. So all these things. 

(00:27:33):
I think the natural reaction is, why would I play this game if I'm a startup or a company? You can even see this with ChatGPT, as an example. They just launched these deep research connectors. One of them was my former company, HubSpot. If you sat inside HubSpot and you were just thinking in isolation, you would be like, well, why would I want to make all of my data accessible through ChatGPT and have all of the usage you start to accrue there? That doesn't really make sense in isolation. But we don't operate in isolation. Once again, we operate in a competitive environment.

(00:28:11):
What's going to happen is that if you don't do it, your competitors are going to certainly go to the new platform and your customer expectations change, and you have to rise to those customers' expectations. They're going to start expecting you to be in these new experiences and all these things. It ends up being a prisoner's dilemma, which is, there is no opting out of the game. You have to play the game. So it's better to be early than to be super late to this game, especially, especially if you are a startup. That's the key opportunity. 

(00:28:51):
We will talk a little bit more about how to play the game more, but it's better to be early as well as, then the key, the harder part about it is anticipating that last stage of the cycle and figuring out how to sequence away from something before that last cycle comes. I think that's the key part, but let me pause there and then I'll talk a little bit about ChatGPT and some of my reasoning behind that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:12):
Cool. So what you're saying is not only is there going to be this big opportunity to grow, if you don't take advantage of it, somebody in your space will. It's not only there's an opportunity, but this is something you need to do because you might miss the boat. 

(00:29:26):
I think about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies. If they didn't do that, they would've missed the boat, someone else would've eaten that lunch. I don't know, I'm thinking about the Technology Bros podcast on Twitter right now, TBPN, where they basically figured out on Twitter you can create this livestream and you see it all day in your Twitter feed just like, hey, they're broadcasting, and it's a really cool distribution channel.

(00:29:49):
I think there's a big call to arms here almost of just the opportunities emerging and you basically need to pay attention. You can't opt out.

Brian Balfour (00:29:58):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:58):
Awesome. 

Brian Balfour (00:29:58):
Exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):
Okay, so let's talk ChatGPT.

Brian Balfour (00:30:02):
Look, let's go through this cycle. Right now we're in that competitive environment. Like we said, all those players we talked about, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, all these folks, they are battling it out. We've seen this with the Talent Awards especially over the past month or so. There's no clear winner yet, but there's consensus around the category. 

(00:30:25):
The second thing is then, okay, what's the moat? Has the moat been identified? And who seems to have identified it the first or as furthest along? My hypothesis, and I think there's a lot more consensus around this now than there might've even been three months ago, is that the moat is about context and memory. These models by themselves, if you compare them side by side, they generate the same result, and so the actual difference-maker is which one has more of your context, because it's the context plus the model that produces the best output, and then that starts to accrue to this loop around memory. The more you use it, the more it's able to store a memory around you, which feeds more personalized context, which produces better outputs. It ends up being another one of those flywheels, another one of those loops. 

(00:31:16):
If you look at who's farthest on this, it definitely is ChatGPT. They were the first ones to memory. They've been investing a lot in these different types of data connectors, essentially context connectors, gathering all of this context, so you can really start to see it in the usage. 

(00:31:37):
The second thing is, and one of the pushbacks I've gotten on my prediction has been, well, what about Google and Gemini? They have so much distribution through Chrome and all of this other stuff. Deedy Das, who's a VC at Menlo Ventures, actually published some good data on retention of all of these different ones. 

(00:32:00):
I think the second reason I predict ChatGPT is if you look at history once again, it was never the person who had the biggest distribution at the moment of time. It was the one that had the best retention and engagement. Google had the best retention and engagement over the others. Facebook was smaller, but had way better retention and engagement over the others, so on and so forth. 

(00:32:22):
The data that Deedy published clearly show that both the retention curves, which I know you and I have both written about at exhaustion, level off at significant portions higher than all the other platforms, as well as those retention curves have been shifting up dramatically over time, you can start to see the effects of memory. They have the very elusive smile curve, the ones that you just like. I've seen all of those dynamics very few times in my career, and they tend to be the folks like Slack and all of the big winners. It's just so elusive

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:04):
The smile curve, just to people who don't know what that is, is essentially retention goes up over time, it goes down a little bit, and then you come back to it and you use it more.

Brian Balfour (00:33:12):
Yeah, that's right, and it's usually the result of some type of network of factor or something else, and it's an early indicator that that platform is on a trajectory to hit escape velocity. 

(00:33:27):
The third piece is that, and they haven't really hidden these, but there's all sorts of signals that they're about to launch a third-party platform. They've been hiring for a bunch of roles. I've seen multiple postings on product manager engineering roles, all that kind of stuff for, quote, unquote, "agent platform" and all those pieces. It feels pretty inevitable that one of these players will need to launch a third-party platform in order to serve all the possible use cases on these tools. There's going to be some value exchange, which is like, hey, for your agent to be effective, you probably need access to the context and memory and distribution, so there'll be some value which is, "Integrate to us and we'll give you those three things which is going to drive more users and more usage," and we're going to go through the steps of the cycle. 

(00:34:21):
You can already see this. They're starting to form preferred partnerships with some of the bigger players, which paves the way for smaller third-party players. It lends credibility to the platform. It's like, well, if HubSpot and XYZ are doing it, then I should probably do it, too. It's like that type of mentality. But that's why I think out of all of these platforms, ChatGPT has the best shot right now. 

(00:34:47):
And then, a bunch of folks are always like, "Well, what about Claude? I really like Claude. I use Claude." Well, the problem with that is I think ChatGPT at this point has at least a 10x difference on MAU. If you're a developer and you're comparing those two platforms and you're looking at it and you're like, "Well, ChatPT has 10x the number of users and better retention engagement," it's like, what's the logical choice of which one you're going to prioritize your scarce resources on? 

(00:35:20):
Those are just some of the reasons that my prediction is on ChatGPT. In the blog post that I wrote about this, I actually then played my own devil's advocate and said, "Okay, here are some reasons why it might not be ChatGPT," but I think we're in that part of the cycle. That's my prediction. I might be wrong in the prediction of ChatGPT, but I really think, I feel very confident we're going to see this cycle play out again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):
Two follow-up questions here. One is, what would be the backup if it's not ChatGPT? It sounds like it might be Gemini or Google?

Brian Balfour (00:35:51):
My hypothesis of who's best-positioned but is not executing on it right now would actually be Apple-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):
Whoa.

Brian Balfour (00:35:59):
... because through the devices, they basically can see everything. They have the ultimate view into your context. They're sitting at that level But I don't know what they're doing. From an execution standpoint, maybe they're going to surprise us with something crazy magical, but we haven't seen any external signals around this. That's probably just based on what real estate and where people live in the stack would own. 

(00:36:34):
And then, I think right behind that, I would probably put Google because of owning the context of things like email and the distribution points of search and Chrome and Android and those types of pieces. A lot of people point to them, but my experience with all of their products, going back to the retention engagement thing, is that if we could take a look inside their metrics, I think what we would see is a bunch of fly-by users in their mouse. They're sprinkling the Gemini bucket everywhere. I've literally clicked on it accidentally multiple times. My guess is a huge portion of their mouse is exactly that of what's happening right now. Look, they just acquired a very talented team from Windsurf and from-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:30):
And just the team. Just the team, part of the team.

Brian Balfour (00:37:31):
Yeah. We'll see. Things are changing dramatically on a week-to-week basis, so we'll see if they're able to press those advantages in a very clear way. But I think the window is very small for them if ChatGPT plays their cards right, because they clearly have the escape velocity right now. If they just keep pressing that advantage in the right way, I think it's going to be very hard for Google to counter in the amount of time that's left

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00):
The goal of your Kindle strategies, these like non-scalable hacks, they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users.

Lenny (00:12):
Pinterest, Airbnb, Reddit, Canva, Hipcamp, Thumbtack, Fair, Tinder, Eventbrite. What do these companies have in common? Casey Winters, Casey has worked with and advised more consumer companies on their product and growth strategy than anyone in the world. He's also very generous with his time and often sets time aside to help founders and product leaders. I always learned so much talking to Casey, and I'm excited for you to hear this episode. In our chat we covered Casey's advice on making trade offs as a product leader, justifying non-sexy product investments, the spectrum of product people and how to level up your skills, new growth trends and tactics that he's seeing, when to focus on growth, and a bunch of advice on growth strategy, and so many other things. As a bonus, we're going to be doing a live AMA with Casey in my newsletter Slack community on August 5th at 10:00 AM Pacific time, so if you'd like to ask Casey any questions, make sure to get there. Until then enjoy this episode with Casey Winters. Hey Casey Winters, what do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (01:19):
Coda's a company that's actually near and dear to my heart because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create LKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it, so they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (01:56):
I actually use Coda myself every day, it's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, to organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners of this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement, just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

(03:26):
Casey, welcome to the pod. I feel like every time that we chat, I leave with at least one new perspective that kind of blew my mind on product, or growth, or even just the world. And so I'm really excited to have this conversation mostly to selfishly extract as much knowledge out of your head as I can in the hour that we have together. And so with that welcome.

Casey Winters (03:50):
Very kind, happy to be here.

Lenny (03:52):
You've worked at so many iconic companies and worked with so many iconic companies. It almost boggles the mind just looking at your LinkedIn, trying to scroll through LinkedIn and you have to click on, see additional experiences. And there's just so many places you've worked, so many companies you've worked with. Could you just give listeners maybe a 10,000 foot view of your career arc through product and growth?

Casey Winters (04:15):
Well, I started my career as an analyst at apartments.com on the marketing side, so it was my job to measure every channel for effectiveness in driving leads. These are things like SEO, AdWords, affiliate marketing email, so once I got good at measuring that I naturally started working on optimizing those channels directly. And then I started going to do user research and understand how the product could be better so that we could convert leads better. And it was at that point that I got the feedback from the company that I was this weird marketing and product hybrid, and they didn't really know what to do with that, because those were two totally separate departments. It wasn't until I got to GrubHub and I was the 15th employee and they were like, dude, we don't care.

(05:01):
As long as you grow how many people order food, I don't care if you work on marketing, I don't care if you change the product, do whatever we'll have results. And we now call these roles growth, but that term didn't exist at the time, so I basically worked on growing the demand side of that business from Series A to IPO. We ended up creating a product management function out of my team there, but for the first four years we didn't have product titles either. That was kind of a newer idea, also. It wasn't until I went to Pinterest that I was actually formally labeled a product person.

(05:37):
I ended up leading the growth product team there. We basically had to rebuild the growth model of the business to reignite growth, so I was there from 40 million MAU to 150 million MAU. And it was around that time that I started doing some more advising with Airbnb on the demand side, with Pocket. And then I went to a VC named Greylock Partners and worked with their companies on growth and scaling. And then I just independently started working as a full-time advisor with companies like Eventbrite, Tinder, Thumbtack, Canva. And after doing that for a couple years, Eventbrite opened this chief product officer role and they asked me to take it, so now I've been doing that for three years now.

Lenny (06:18):
That's an excellent segue to our next little segment that I want to get into, which is partly your CPO role and the work that you do there. And also touching a bit on a bit of the writing that you've done. You're currently a chief product officer at Eventbrite, which is a company that I love, I have so many friends there and they're all amazing, such a big fan of the company. And I know a lot of listeners are maybe thinking about becoming CPO someday as a goal.

Casey Winters (06:18):
Yep.

Lenny (06:43):
And so I thought it'd be cool to chat through some of the challenges that you're having and some of the things you've learned in the role.

Casey Winters (06:49):
Sure.

Lenny (06:50):
Cool.

Casey Winters (06:50):
Yeah.

Lenny (06:51):
I'll be more specific, so one of the things that you mentioned that you're working on is thinking about trade offs and being very explicit about trade offs you're making, communicating why you made certain trade offs and then just generally communicating that upward to executives and then across the company, so I'm curious just to hear what you've learned around how to communicate trade offs and internal communication?

Casey Winters (07:11):
Yeah, one of the things I found, especially during the pandemic at Eventbrite, where we weren't obviously hiring a lot of people and we had lots of various issues come up, is that a lot of managers and leaders would just try to deal with issues on their own and not raise them or escalate them with me in particular. And some of these were really tough situations, so then later on, I'd ask why something went wrong or why we didn't achieve a goal. And I get some feedback from my team of like, Hey, you don't understand the situation. This is really impossible. There's all these things going wrong. And then I respond. Yeah, of course I don't understand this situation because you haven't told me about it. How am I supposed to evaluate things fairly if you don't let me know what's really going on, so these people on my team thought that being a leader was handling it the best they could given the circumstances when in many cases the right way is to escalate the issue so that perhaps I could help them change the circumstances, so the circumstances aren't as dire.

(08:14):
And if I can't change the circumstances, I'm at least aware of the circumstances and the explicit trade off we've made to deal with that situation. And then I can help communicate that better to others across the company, and I can help evaluate the results with the proper context and do it more fairly. I find that in general people just way under communicate upward inside of companies. And then they'll complain that executives are out of touch when they aren't telling executives what the executives need to know. Then when people inside a company do try to communicate upward a lot of times they're so in the weeds that as an executive, I just don't understand what they're saying. And then when I ask questions it's like as an exec, I'm asking a question in another language. It's like I don't know if you've ever seen Ocean's Twelve, but as a joke, they invite Matt Damon to this business meeting and they just talk in code as a prank on him.

(09:14):
And that's what a lot of people on my team feel sometimes when they're talking to the executives of like, I don't even understand what these questions mean. It's like you're speaking another language. One of the ways I try to frame it to my team is if you're not an executive, whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one, which is what part of the company strategy are you working on? What metrics are you trying to improve? What assumptions are you making that are guiding what you're building? And I find that many times when non-executives are presenting to execs, they'll start on like chapter six, so even if that part of the story is right, it's like a good story. You haven't earned the right to tell that part of the story yet because you skipped the first five chapters. And I've definitely seen people with the opposite problem as well, which I call starting at the beginning of the time where you come into a meeting with the CEO or with the CFO or something.

(10:20):
And you basically spend the first 20 minutes, re-explaining the company strategy or who our customer is or something that everyone already knows. And then by the time you get to explaining new information, you've used up your allotted time, so I try to coach my team to be in the middle. Like don't start on chapter six of the story, but also don't start with a textbook on the English language either. You want to find the last point in your story, that would be completely obvious to the person you're telling the story to, and then go from there to things that would be less obvious, but that they can follow along with. And it's a lot of work to really dial that in across different types of people you're trying to communicate that story to because of course, upward communication isn't all that you're doing, right? You're trying to communicate that down to your team, to individual engineers and designers, and they're going to need to hear some very different things then say the CPO of the company, or the CEO of the company, so it's a challenge I see quite frequently.

Lenny (11:19):
Can you talk a bit about how you actually coach PMs on this? Is this like in one-on-ones you revisit a presentation they gave that could have been better? Is it after a presentation, you pull them aside and talk through what they could have done better. How do you approach that?

Casey Winters (11:33):
Well, I think the best way to coach is actually to do it before the meeting, so I think there's a tendency in product management and product design to want to do meetings where there's kind of this big reveal and an aha to the audience. And it's kind of the opposite of how you want to handle most of these situations. You want to de-risk that meeting not make it a big success or fail moment, so there's a few things that I do. One is if there is a big presentation coming up or something like that, I try to run through it with the team, pretending to be the other members of the audience that are going to be there, so I'll say, okay, well, what the CFO's going to ask about here is X. And you want to answer that question before it gets asked. What Julia, our CEO is going to ask about is why, so you want to weave that into the early story and not wait for her to ask.

(12:28):
You kind of role play the entire thing based on the different people that they're going to be communicating with. Something I commonly say is that executive communication is actually executives communication. You're communicating with individual executives that all have different styles and different concerns about the business or about the particular problem you're working on. And you want to anticipate that, and if you don't have enough experience say presenting to the CFO or the CEO, I as the chief product officer do, so I can impersonate them and help you understand what they're going to care most about. The other thing that I push a lot of my team to do is have pre-meetings with some of those key individuals, so that they're going to be less surprised in the meeting about what you're talking about, that you've gotten any major concerns brought to your attention before the big meeting.

(13:18):
And that helps de-risk how poorly a meeting like that can go, so definitely at the individual presentation level, doing that pre-meeting. What I'm working on a lot now is trying to have more of a scaled approach to training this type of upward communication. And what types of frameworks, what types of structure tend to work for Eventbrite and making sure that everyone on my team is just really well versed in that and comfortable in it because of course, confidence projection is a key part of these types of meetings as well.

Lenny (13:54):
This is such important advice that I think a lot of PMs don't recognize how important it is to prepare for important meetings like this. Just to give folks context, maybe that aren't doing this sort of thing when they're working at a larger company, how much time do you spend or an ICPM should spend on preparing for these things just to set a little bit of a reference point?

Casey Winters (14:13):
Well, it's an interesting question because I think different people have different styles on how they want to handle this. I'd say the way my brain works in these situations which I think is a little bit atypical, is I'm actually a little bit better if I am free forming a lot of elements and just speaking from confidence in areas I know versus specifically trying to lay out every exact bullet point I want to hit. I'm going to show up as more comfortable, I'm going to show up as more dynamic, and I'm going to be able to engage in a more thoughtful conversation, so for me, my approach to these sorts of things is I write a lot. I write a lot of notes. I write a lot of documents. And then in general, for any of these types of communications, I am just pulling from things I know deeply because I've written them down, I've thought a lot about them.

(15:10):
For a lot of other people they really just need to spend a lot of time on prep to make sure they nail the communication they want to nail. And I found it requires a different amount of investment for different people on my team, so the point is not as much how much time you spend, it's how well do you really know the material, and how well do you really know what your audience is going to care about with that material so that you are prepared for every question you might get. I'll give an example from my Pinterest days, the primary way with which you interfaced on any key strategic topic was product review, right? You'd go in and you talk to Ben, our CEO and Jack our head of product. And Ben and Jack had very different styles of communication. Jack in particular would very early on ask a few different data questions to get context on the problem. And if you, as a product leader or an individual PM or an individual designer didn't know the answers to any of those, it cast doubt on the entire rest of that meeting.

(16:17):
Because, the team wouldn't be confident that you had all the right context to understand the problem, so a lot of what I would coach my team on is, okay, I'm pretty confident Jack's going to ask this question, then this question, then this question. Based on the material I'm seeing from you, how well are you prepared to answer those questions? Different execs might be somewhat different in that regard, but if you haven't thought through all the questions that might be asked from the document that you're sharing or the presentation you're about to present, you're not prepared enough, right. You need to know the entire universe of how that meeting can go. And that may take you dozens of hours, it might take you three hours, but the most important thing is that you've asked what possible questions can be asked and am I prepared to answer all of those? Do I have all the data in front of me to answer all of those? But because if I don't the chances of the meeting you're having a negative outcome just increased dramatically.

Lenny (17:17):
I imagine some people are listening to this and they're like, holy shit, I need to spend this much time on preparing for meetings like this, but in my experience, that's exactly what you do need to do to be successful. And so this is real good, real talk about how long it takes to prepare for important meetings like the ones you're talking about.

Casey Winters (17:33):
Absolutely. I mean, for better or worse, the way that a lot of key decisions are made inside companies are through these types of forums and meetings. And it's an extremely high leverage piece of time for a product manager or a product designer in terms of how much impact they can have. And if you are under preparing for those sorts of things, the chances of you being able to have the type of impact you want, to have the type of career growth you want just go down dramatically. And I'm sure, you and I have definitely made mistakes in our career in important meetings in the past, but I think one of the things that I really try to do is learn from each one of those and make sure those types of issues wouldn't happen again. And now I feel like I have a pulse on, I know if I haven't done the work going into a meeting, that's going to make it have a more negative result.

(18:26):
And now I'm pretty accurate. And look sometimes you just didn't have enough time and it is what it is. But now I know, okay, I know I'm not quite prepared for this and it can go poorly as a result. And I know also when I've done the right prep and I'm ready for anything, whether it's a board meeting, or a meeting with the executive team, or a meeting with an external partner, right? And I think that's what you're trying to build as any sort of product leader, or PM, or product designer, or researcher, is that intuition of like I'm ready for this, I know everything that's going to come at me, I'm prepared for any eventual outcome. And if you're not, then probably the answer is spend more time to get ready.

Lenny (19:09):
Speaking of spending more time, another topic that you shared with me that you're thinking a lot about as a CPO is keeping the Eventbrite product simple while adding more and more functionality to make it more usable by more people and more use cases. And so I'd love to hear how you're approaching that because I know that's something every single product faces eventually assuming they keep growing, and survive, and keep adding more power.

Casey Winters (19:34):
Yeah, Scott Belsky who's the chief product officer of Adobe. He has this concept of the product life cycle you're probably familiar with, but I'll explain it to your listeners, which is users flock to a simple product. The product takes users for granted and adds more features for power users and then users flock to the next simple product as a result. And I've done a lot of research and work on this problem. And I found that there are a few different design hacks, essentially that companies use to try to avoid this cycle. One is okay if you build out more complex functionality, un-bundle it over time, like Facebook Messenger, Uber Eats have done, right? At Pinterest, we did a heavy investment in progressive disclosure, which is let's hide a lot of the more complex functionality until we make sure our users learn the really critical functionality. And then we can open up more of the full suite of the product.

(20:34):
Then there's just proactive training. You can get on a video call with your customers or a phone call, much more common in enterprise, obviously, or you might have a custom UI that goes away over time. That's giving you the training wheels. You can also segment experiences based on different user types, so certain users might get a very simple user experience and then some users might get the more complex one, and there's different packages and interfaces that cleanly separate the two, maybe that more complex experience also bundles in training. What I found is that just none of these really worked that well for the Eventbrite scenario, because we have different types of event creators across every possible level of complexity and sophistication. We have people that are putting on their first event and they expect five people to show up. We have people putting on a hundred events per year that really know what they're doing.

(21:32):
And then users also shift from one of those categories to another over time. They can get more sophisticated as they build up their business, so segmentation doesn't really work that well. Progressive disclosure doesn't work that well either because in many of these cases, we never want certain types of users to find the more advanced stuff, it's just going to confuse them. We strive for this concept of what we call perceived simplicity, which is there are advanced features in the product and they are easily discoverable when you look for them, but they're effectively hidden if you're not looking for them. And of course the majority of users aren't going to ever look for them, so the advanced more complex areas of the product don't make the product harder to use for the majority who will never need that level of complexity. And there are areas where we do this well and areas where we're still working on getting better, but that's really our aspiration.

(22:26):
The company that I feel like has always done the best job of this is WhatsApp, where at its core, it's a chat app and it's really good at being a chat app. But I remember when I went to Brazil, all of a sudden I started receiving voice messages and it was really easy to figure out how to use them and how to do them myself. When I needed to learn how to do video calls or phone calls, it would take less than a second to figure out how to use the more advanced stuff, but it's effectively kind of hidden if you're not looking for it. That's what we aspire to at Eventbrite. And in some cases we're doing well. And in some cases, we definitely have some work to do.

Lenny (22:59):
Is there an example of a win in that direction in the Eventbrite product that you're proud of using this model or even something that's like, oh man, this is really broken?

Casey Winters (23:08):
Yeah, we've definitely had some wins here on the marketing side of our products, so one of the bigger investments we've made recently is our creators do a lot of their own marketing to try to get people to come to their events and transact on Eventbrite in the process. But our event creators, they're not professional marketers, they try to figure these tools out, so we built a product that allows them to automate their Facebook advertising to get better results, supercharged by our data. And the product's working really well, but we found is that there are certain segments that, I want to geek out on this a little bit, right.

(23:47):
They want to figure out all the different target segments and optimize their creative, and then there are many creators who just want it done for them. We've been able to build some interfaces where the default is super simple, we'll handle the targeting for you, we'll handle the creative and then, Hey, here's an on-ramp if you want to get a little bit more sophisticated and do more of this yourself, so that's an area where I wouldn't say we've perfected it, but we've now really understood those different types of users and a have easy pass for both of them to be successful, so I'm really happy with that.

Lenny (24:22):
Awesome. Another topic that you wrote about that kind of touches on the stuff we were just talking about is justify non-sexy product improvements, things like stability, performance, developer velocity, things that as a PM leader, you're just like, no, no, no, let's just... The default is let's do that later, we got to hit our fricking metrics, we've got to drive growth. And you had some really interesting insights on how you think about justifying these sorts of things. And so I'd love to hear that from you?

Casey Winters (24:49):
The idea is that some of the most impactful projects that product teams can work on at scale, not early stage startups per se, but at scale are the hardest to measure. And because of that, they just get chronically underfunded. It's that old adage, what gets measured gets managed, right? For things like user experience, or performance, or developer velocity, or just a product area that's deemed un-sexy, like growth used to be back in the day, I walk through some examples of a few tactics that work to get around this problem, building custom metrics to show the value, being able to run small tests that prove the worthwhile-ness of the investment, creating some team principles that make sure you don't ever kind of forget about these important elements that can hurt you in the long run. And also just how to use experiments to build buy-in at the broader level.

(25:41):
And one of the main takeaways besides some of those tactics in being successful here is that you have to get a team to buy-in to this. You can't really do a lot of this work alone, right? If you're a PM, you want to be approaching this from a well, my engineering manager and my design leader also bought in that we need to work on performance or we've all aligned that the user experience is not going in quite the direction we want, and we want to head some problems off that may not improve metrics today, but could certainly decline metrics tomorrow. And if you can get a small team, what two, three people aligned on the importance of something that's deemed un-sexy. It's a lot easier to start to build this game plan around metrics or running small tests or structuring OKRs to not only prioritize this work, but to show some really massive impact. Which could then get the rest of the company much more excited to make investments themselves.

Lenny (26:48):
What I'm hearing is step one is just get your kind of peer leaders aligned behind something that may not obviously be something your leaders want you to do, is that right?

Casey Winters (26:59):
Absolutely, yep.

Lenny (27:01):
This episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I asked product managers and designers on Twitter, what software do they use most? Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, white boarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs. And that includes thousands of built in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer, visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up, that's whimsical.com/lenny.

(27:47):
Is there anything else that you think is really valuable, powerful, effective in just getting folks to getting your leaders to basically go along with some that maybe isn't going to move metrics or is that the core of it?

Casey Winters (27:57):
Well, yeah. I mean, definitely it's hard when you can't create a metric that they can understand. I think the other area to think about is when you're an early stage company, everything you're doing is trying to drive upside, like trying to drive growth in some way, it could be short term or long term, but you're trying to drive real growth for the business. But then when you've actually built a real business, a lot of times people are still in that same mode, which is everything is trying to add more growth on top of what we've already got. But when you're at scale, you can actually lose what you've built, so trying to help whether it's executives or just your manager, understand that this thing we've got, whether it's a high conversion rate or good engagement on this feature, it could go away if we don't do these other things.

(28:48):
And here's what it would look like if that goes away, that can be incredibly powerful. I think we were fortunate at Pinterest in this regard, in that we were a fast growing startup that stopped growing due to some changes in the market related to Facebook. And then actually once we had switched to growing primarily through SEO, there was an algorithm change that severely impacted our growth at one point in time, so that helped the company build more intuition of like we're not guaranteed the gains from all the things we've built in the past. We need to do things to protect them and protecting what we've got actually is increasingly important once you build scale, because now you've built something really valuable already. And yes, we want to make it more valuable of course, but it's hard to make it more valuable if you're eroding some of the gains you've already built, so that's another element that I think can be pretty impactful.

Lenny (29:41):
In your post on this topic you have an awesome chart of product market fit over time, illustrating the point you just made that it doesn't last and you have to keep iterating to keep your product market fit like you're by default falling behind if you're not continuing to push there, right?

Casey Winters (29:54):
Yeah. I think the concept is user expectations just continue to go up every day in terms of their expectations on user experience, on the value that they expect your product to provide, but also the competitive landscape in the market continues to get better. Yeah, if you're not continually pushing to make your product better, your user experience better, your latency better, then you're eventually not necessarily tomorrow, but maybe in a year, maybe in five years, you might find yourself fall out of product market fit entirely. And that's a really dangerous place to be, because then it's going to take a long time to figure that out and make adjustments. And then you probably have more technical debt to clean up, to be able to get back to where you need to be, where the market has reached in terms of expectations, so just doing work to make sure you never get in that situation is extremely valuable, in my opinion. It's something that I think a lot of teams forget about.

Lenny (30:54):
I think you're going to create nightmares for a lot of founders listening to this right now.

Casey Winters (30:59):
That's not the intention, but-

Lenny (31:02):
No, it's a kick in the butt. Another post that I definitely wanted to chat about. Maybe your SPST post, maybe I'm curious if there are others is around operations team, product ops and generally ops people.

Casey Winters (31:12):
Yep.

Lenny (31:13):
And this point that you made that ops is often a sign of inefficiency on a product team because in theory, a lot of the roles should be done by software, eventually. I'd love to unpack this and hear your take on this?

Casey Winters (31:26):
I think I originally got the idea for the post in that I had written another essay on MarTech. And how MarTech to be really successful, it's really got a target engineers more so than marketers. And that a lot of MarTech businesses just aren't very good businesses. And I think I got an invite to speak at a MarTech conference to a bunch of marketers about this post. And it's like, well, that sounds like a terrible idea. I'm basically telling a bunch of marketers that what they're investing in isn't that important, and that they're not the most important target customer. And I remember reading something about the conference that was like a conference for the growth of the marketing operations professional. And then I was like, oh no, that's not what I want in the industry at all. Like having marketing ops means you suck at marketing.

(32:18):
And obviously that's a bit of hyperbole. I'm not against the concept of a marketing ops role or a product ops role, we have a product ops team at Eventbrite, but as someone who ran a double digit million marketing budget at GrubHub without marketing ops, because we invested in automation and we invested in process, it scares me when the first tactic people go to is to add people to help scale. There's nothing wrong with people obviously, there's nothing wrong with operations people. The thing I have a problem with is normalizing ops as a distinct stable function where operations rules are amazing and how we utilize them at Eventbrite is their explicit job is to go find inefficiencies and build process or software to root out that inefficiency, so then they can go find other places to be more valuable. When you say, oh, their job is to do this manual process long term.

(33:16):
That's where I get super concerned because you're not rooting out efficiency in how you build your company. And that's where I feel like a lot of this can go if you're not careful, Intercom has a really good blog post on this from a while back around their business operations team. And they basically up front in that post say the goal of business operations is to not exist, and I definitely very much agree with that. I think in general functional ops roles, whether it's product ops or marketing ops or whatever, they're a hack to deal with some sort of functional issue on your team. And it's totally okay to have functional issues. Startups are going to have functional issues all over the place, but if the way they deal with that functional issue is by building larger and larger operations teams and roles. That's basically exacerbating an inefficiency issue, a functional issue, it's not fixing it. It's a form of empire building and in general empire building is something I don't have a lot of tolerance for.

(34:16):
You're making more of a function unable to operate without human intervention by saying the goal is to scale up marketing ops or product ops. Whereas what the goal should be is let's use our brains to run experiments, to make us more functional with less people. We're more efficient, we could add more value to the customer, and to the business. And if that means I don't actually need to have this product operations job in a year. That's awesome. And guess what, if you've shown you've done a really great job at rooting out inefficiencies. Every part of the company's going to want you to do some other job if that job is no longer valuable, because you've done such good job eliminating the need for it. There isn't this real concern that I'm going to lose my job by being too effective at it. It's like, no, you're going to show that you're just awesome at many types of jobs that product leaders or marketing leaders care about, so that's my perspective.

Lenny (35:09):
I love that. And this happened a lot at Airbnb, a lot of amazing office people ended up moving into other roles once the role was not necessary or they just wanted to do something else. And clearly people wanted them on their team because they were killing it.

Casey Winters (35:20):
Indeed.

Lenny (35:21):
One last question about the CPO role, and then I want to shift a bit to just product management and growth. What is the job of a CPO for folks that are just like, what the heck, what is this thing? What do you do all day?

Casey Winters (35:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (35:32):
And then what does it take to get there? Just like what should people work on most if they're trying to get to CPO someday?

Casey Winters (35:39):
First off, when you think about what's the job, the way I think about it is I'm responsible for leading and facilitating the development of products and features that deliver value for Eventbrite's customers that will translate into value for the business. And each of those words were chosen pretty carefully. Now in terms of the scope of the function, a CPO role can lead a few different sub-functions. In my case, I lead product management, product design, research, and growth marketing, but different roles have kind of some or not as many of those, it can be pretty custom depending on the size of the company and what the leader's skill sets are. To talk a little bit more depth about the role. I think it's my job to make sure Eventbrite chooses the best possible product strategy based on the information we have, that we can adjust that strategy as we learn and continue to build that feedback loop.

(36:35):
It's also my job to define and consistently improve the process through which we set our product strategy, how we prioritize projects, how we execute on them to make sure we're delivering that value to our customers, we're delivering those tangible business results. And to do that in a way where the rest of the company understands it and is able to participate in it as well, so this is things like identifying bottlenecks that prevent us from delivering value, or quality, or doing that at the detriment of speed, working with people across the company to remove those bottlenecks, making sure people outside of development are aware of what we're building, participating in the development and feedback of what we're building, as well as in helping deliver that for like a GTM perspective. And last but not least, and we've talked a little bit about this earlier, training the team on what it means to be an effective product manager, product designer, user research, et cetera, at Eventbrite.

(37:36):
And then of course hiring people who can augment our existing team on everything I just mentioned, so I'm accountable for what we build driving value for the business. And there's of course going to be many times where what we build doesn't end up driving value. It's hard to predict sometimes, but it's my job to improve that conversion rate and the magnitude of impact over time. It might not be that everything we build delivers value, but I want most of it to, and I want the impact of that value to be higher and higher over time. You also asked about what it takes to get to the CPO role. And I think my journey's been more irregular than most of the people you probably talk to. Product management when I started my career, it was all a waterfall. It was built around massive releases, it was a totally different job from what we do now. Marketing was a lot more agile in the lowercase sense of agile and it mapped to my mind better as someone who's really influenced by the book, The Goal.

(38:40):
I think the tangible pieces of advice to get to this level that may be helpful is I always focused on where I thought there was leverage. I wanted to learn everything I could and focus on the things that had a big impact regardless of the org structure or the career path that meant, I wanted to really have a deep understanding of the entire business so I knew just what was worth focusing on to help the business. I think one of the things that's different about being a chief product officer versus other product roles is how much of a company leadership role it is versus a functional leadership role. You're expected in this role to optimize for the entire company, even at the expense of what's good for your team, so you really have to learn how to optimize for company first. That's like a key thing to learn that I think new executives can struggle with. And what advantage I think I had is I've basically been working with executives since my first job at apartments.com, so I learned to speak their language and understood what they cared about pretty early in my career.

(39:47):
And this is a really important element, assume that questions from them are them trying to learn versus them assuming you don't know something and testing you about it. I find that a lot of people get intimidated by executive questions when the executive is just trying to understand things. And then that changes the interaction you can have. The other element that served me well was just refusing to specialize. I thought if I could learn all the skills that would allow me to combine them to work on the most important things versus only work on the thing I knew how to work on. And that definitely led to slower visible progress in terms of career growth or titles, but it was a much faster path to the true executive role because I could speak better with CEOs about more topics than most of my peers. Obviously this is all my individual experience there are many paths to get to this type of level, but those are some things that have worked for me.

Lenny (40:45):
That was such an incredible definition and so much good advice there. And this is a good segue to another area that you have a really interesting insight on around the spectrum of product people. When I think of you, I think of two by twos and this is I think just a spectrum, which is unusual for Casey framework.

Casey Winters (41:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (41:01):
I'd love to hear your take on how you think about the spectrum and around up-scaling PMs to move along that spectrum?

Casey Winters (41:06):
The idea is, and this is something I was inspired from talking with Omar who runs product at Cambly. He used to run core product at Pinterest. It's this idea of any product team is like a gang of misfits, they all come from different backgrounds. Most people didn't start as a product manager, their first job, they might have been in sales, or in marketing, or analytics, or engineering, right. Everyone's bringing these different skill sets to the table. But the main spectrum that I've observed in product teams of any decent size is that you have two extreme types of product managers per se, and on perhaps the left side of the spectrum you have the crazy innovator types, they have so many different ideas, they pay attention to every single change in the industry, they all know all about the latest Apple API or Snapchat's latest product feature.

(42:06):
Those people are going to have ideas all the time. Actually, probably most of those ideas are going to be bad, but one out of ten's going to be just a game changer and they're generally not super great at turning that idea into action. And then on the extreme right side of the spectrum will be your typical executional focused PM, and they can do a really good job of taking a strong strategy and turning it into action that creates value for the customer, but they generally don't know what's going on in the industry. They can't think of a totally new product idea themselves. They're going to need support from above to be able to push them in the right direction and then they got it from there. When you think about recruiting, what we all want as CPOs in terms of people we bring into our team is we want people in the middle. We want people who are strategic, they understand what's going on in the industry, they can generate some good ideas, but they can also turn it into something real that delivers value for the customer and the company.

(43:08):
And there just aren't a ton of those people in the world. Not as many as we would like to recruit, so as a product leader, if I'm airing on the side of which side of the spectrum I want people from, I generally will take people who are good at execution over people who are good at generating ideas, because of course there's always too many good ideas that a company need to focus and execute well on the best ones. Whereas if I were a VC, I would probably bias to the people on the left because I don't need every company to work. If I invest in 10 different entrepreneurs who have crazy ideas and one of them works and becomes the next Airbnb, turns out I've done incredibly well as a venture capitalist. The challenge you practically deal with as a product leader is you end up recruiting, and managing, and growing a lot of executional people who can get stuff done, but if they want to get to the director level or if they want to get to my level, they need to get more strategic.

(44:06):
And we don't have good ways to turn great executors into great strategists as in general, like a product function, so I've started investing in a lot of different things here. Obviously I've built some programs for Reforge around product strategy. A lot of my team goes to those to try to learn. I've also been doing a lot of mentorship with the team to try to teach them what it looks like to do that well. I've had people come in to speak with the team like you and many other great product folks to show my team what great looks like and how people like you developed your skills. And I'm trying lots of different things to try to move more of the team to the middle, where they can be that optimal strategist that still retains that ability to deliver great value on top of the strategy versus just have ideas that can't be executed on. And it's definitely a work in progress, it's a lot of different tactics to try to build that skill set inside the team and scale it. And definitely something I feel like I'm still working on.

Lenny (45:11):
What I'm hearing is a lot of kind of the biggest upside for PMs to develop is basically to become more strategic and all the things you've shared are just ways or a lot of ways to just become better at strategies. It's interesting that that's like what you found to be the most essential piece for PMs to often level up at.

Casey Winters (45:30):
Like you said, it depends on the level, right. Early on in your career as a PM, you're going to get the most value by showing that you can ship real things to customers and that the customers like them, like that's by far the most important thing. But if you want to start managing groups of PMs, if you want to start a running a business unit, or a pillar, or a theme. I as a chief product officer, I'm going to expect you to be able to write that strategy doc without me. And you know what I found, whether it's through the advising roles or through coming into Eventbrite is just a lot of people couldn't do that step.

(46:04):
And that means when you try to become a product leader at the company and the CEO expects that from you and you can't do it, you're going to set yourself up to really cap hard on how fast your career can grow. And you'll get stuck, whether it's at the senior product manager level or at the group PM level, because you can't show that you can drive decision making on your own and that you can push forward new ideas that are going to help the company, so that's definitely where I've seen the biggest bottleneck in terms of skill sets. Obviously there's lots of important skill sets you want to build as a PM, but that one to get to the top is the great filter.

Lenny (46:40):
That's awesome advice for folks listening that are trying to figure out what should I work on? It's kind of simple a lot of times just get better at strategy and it feels like it elevates you in so many other ways.

Casey Winters (46:49):
Yeah, and of course we could talk for hours about what it means to get better at strategy and some of the tactics there.

Lenny (46:54):
It could be a follow up.

Casey Winters (46:56):
Because I know some PMs who struggle with that.

Lenny (46:56):
Follow up.

Casey Winters (46:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (46:58):
Okay.

Casey Winters (46:59):
Podcast number two.

Lenny (46:59):
Podcast number two, let's book it. Okay, so I can't let you go without talking about growth. Everyone's always trying to figure out how do we grow our company?

Casey Winters (46:59):
Right.

Lenny (47:07):
What can we do to accelerate growth? I know you're modest, but I think you're one of the smartest people in the world on this stuff. And so I just want to touch on a couple things in the time that we have here. One is with paid growth becoming increasingly more expensive and difficult, especially with Apple's recent changes.

Casey Winters (47:24):
Yep.

Lenny (47:24):
SEO forever becoming more crowded, sales being always expensive. It's just tough out there for a lot of startups to grow. Are you seeing any interesting or new growth channels or tactics that folks can explore or consider that maybe work for companies that you're looking at?

Casey Winters (47:43):
It's not that there are new channels per se, unless you include tokens from like Web3, which I do not. It's more that there are ways to get leverage on your channels through better flows or lifetime value that companies are figuring out. For example, at Eventbrite, we unified what we're separate direct response and lead generation flows in our performance marketing to acquire creators. And now it just takes less effort, we're getting better CPAs and sales now has the opportunity to pick up any product qualified lead from a direct response customer who may need a little bit more help, and they have the data to now determine if there's high enough value to justify it.

(48:27):
This concept is being dubbed, product led sales. And it's this idea that you can unify self-service loops in a B2B business, which are typically driven by product and your sales loops into one more complex giant loop that operates more efficiently and breaks down the silos. And I think you're going to see an explosion in B2B companies that learn how to unlock that and get sales, and product, and marketing to be working as one larger cross-functional team and building an engine that optimizes all of their skill sets, so that's something I'm pretty excited about, but we're definitely in the early days there.

Lenny (49:02):
That's awesome. I was going to ask you if there's any trends you're seeing around growth and clearly that's one. Are there any other trends, just things happening in the growth world?

Casey Winters (49:12):
Yeah, sure. I think there was this conventional wisdom to just focus on building until you found product market fit and then you can worry about growth. And of course there's some truth in that statement, but now as I'm talking with more and more founders and I'm sure you're seeing this yourself, is we're seeing founders who are thinking about building growth loops into their product before they find product market fit. And it's not so that they can prematurely scale before they have product market fit. It's so that when they find product market fit, they have that built in distribution advantage to grow once they're ready. And founders are starting to intuit what I've written about a bit as well as you, which is that scalable acquisition or what we call an acquisition loop is a requirement for product market fit.

(49:59):
Like if you got a product that retains well and you can't find more users for it, I don't think that's product market fit, so it's really exciting to see that evolution and to see founders think about like it's not about getting a bunch of users before you have a product that works. It's about thinking strategically about how this product's going to grow itself when it's ready to do so. I'm really excited to see the next generation of founders build that muscle early on and also leverage it when they're ready instead of just like, oh, I'm going to throw a bunch of paid ads at it and it's going to work, so that's something I'm really excited about.

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00:00):
Every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

Lenny (00:00:41):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Casey Winters. Casey was one of the first ever guests on the podcast, and the first to make a return appearance. He's a legend in the growth and product community, having worked with or advised companies like Pinterest, Reddit, Canva, Airbnb, Tinder, Thumbtack, Grubhub, and many more. He recently led product at Eventbrite for just about three years, and recently returned to full-time advising, and he's exploring new opportunities.

(00:01:17):
In our chat, we cover something he calls the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager and how to avoid that, what he's found works best when interviewing product managers, what impact he expects from GPT-4 on the role of product management, when to trust your instincts versus your team's insights and instincts, what are all the different kinds of network effects, and how do you effectively leverage them? Plus a great story about what Grubhub missed that let DoorDash and Uber eat their lunch. I always learn so much from chatting with Casey, and I am 100% sure you will learn a lot from this episode. With that, I bring you Casey Winters, after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but if there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack, this leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. 

(00:02:52):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead use your North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. 

(00:03:37):
Casey, welcome back to the podcast.

Casey Winters (00:03:39):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:03:41):
You are the first ever return guest to my podcast. How does that feel?

Casey Winters (00:03:46):
I feel honored, perhaps a bit unworthy, but I'll go with it.

Lenny (00:03:52):
Well, you're both worthy and I'm honored as well. Thanks for joining me again. I have a lot of stuff that I want to chat about, but first of all, I'm just curious, what are you up to these days? I know you left Eventbrite as CPO, I know you're doing a few advisorships with startups, but how are you spending your days, and what do you think is next for Casey Winters?

Casey Winters (00:04:10):
I'm still spending some time with Whatnot and Eventbrite as  advisors. I stepped back from the CPO of Eventbrite in October, but still working on some long-term marketplace strategy stuff, some growth strategy stuff. I'm on the board of a company called Beek, which is like Netflix for audio in Latin America, and I'm doing some angel investing in marketplaces in what I call tech debt as a service, which is what are startups that are building out things that were hard for my teams in the past to build or maintain inside previous companies? The other thing I'm working on is revamping the product strategy program for Reforge. I got some things keeping me busy, but definitely not as busy as I was last year.

Lenny (00:04:53):
This is like a rare, free agent Case Winters time. Should people reach out if they're interested in maybe working with you? What's your advice for people listening?

Casey Winters (00:05:00):
Yeah. I always love seeing how I can help companies. Everyone should err on the side of reaching out and seeing if I have time to help, if there's something they think I can help with. I love talking to startups, so yeah, absolutely. I can't promise anything, but yeah, I just love talking to people about this stuff.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Awesome. We'll point people to how to get in touch with you at the end of the episode, and it'll be in the show notes too. Talking about the CPO role, you're at Eventbrite. You're a CPO. It reminds me of a post you wrote about how hard the CPO role is. There's some quotes that I recall in your post about how, one, if you ever ask a CPO, chief product officer how they're doing, no one's ever going to say, "I'm crushing it right now."

Casey Winters (00:05:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:05:41):
Then there's this other quote about how you basically, as a CPO, just try to put some points on the board before you inevitably get fired. Why is that? Why do you find that, and do you still believe that to be true after leaving that role? 

Casey Winters (00:05:53):
Yeah, I would say I still believe those things I said. It was funny. A product leader who will remain nameless emailed me when I hit year three at Eventbrite, and they said, "Congrats. You didn't get fired after two years. What's your secret?" I think it's very hard to keep product-market fit as a CPO within a company for a long time. The needs of the business shift over time, and of course, we all have different strengths and weaknesses in our game. No one's perfect at everything. In general, as an executive, it's just impossible to do everything perfectly, and any little misstep, mistake, or something you just missed can blow up in a major way. 

(00:06:33):
Frequently, CEOs have visions that can change and get misaligned with the product leader. Also, with leadership roles, you don't get put on a PIP. If a CEO loses confidence, it's over immediately. Nothing like that happened at Eventbrite. I started to see that the areas of leverage for a product leader were just less in my wheelhouse over time. I just talked to my boss about it, and we worked out something where I continue to advise on the things that I'm uniquely good at, and find other people who are better at some of these other things that were maybe more important at the time.

(00:07:09):
Yeah, I'd say it's a really hard role, or a really challenging role. It can be a lot of fun. I learned a lot from doing it, but yeah, I still believe, and I think I've still yet to hear someone say they've really crushed it. 

Lenny (00:07:26):
Is there anything that you learned from that experience to have survived in that role for three years? I imagine you have a lot of skills and you were very valuable to the company, but I don't know, for someone in that's role maybe right now, just like, "Here's something that I did that maybe you should do." 

Casey Winters (00:07:40):
The first one I can think of is a big change from being a product leader to a CPO or something equivalent is you're actually a company exec first and a product exec second. I think some mistakes I made early that I corrected successfully is you want to show that you are caring and paying attention to the overall business first before just taking care of your own product designers, product managers, researchers, whoever. That's advice I found myself doling out to other product leaders a lot more now that I've gone through it. You have to not only truly care, but create the perception that you care about sales, about marketing, about legal, et cetera. Because first and foremost, you're expected to lead the business at that level, so I think that's something that I think is really important.

(00:08:35):
I think something else is really trying to diagnose, without as much bias as possible, where are the strengths and weaknesses of your team? Where are the strengths and weaknesses of your product? Lay that out with your peers and say, "Here's where we are. Here's where I think we need to go. Here's the timeline on which I'm going to work to get us there." Because I think product's such a confusing discipline for people who aren't in it, like a sales leader, many CEOs, a marketing leader, that they don't necessarily know what great looks like. 

(00:09:14):
The things they know about great leadership, they don't know if you know those things, so you have to make it really clear, "Yeah, I know our OKRs are not as quantitative as they should be yet. That's because this team isn't ready for X, Y, and Z. This is where we're going to get them to, but it's going to take some time." One of the things we did at Eventbrite that I thought was really helpful is, when you go public, you tend to rotate over your executive team and get public company execs versus startup execs. A few of us were new, and it's just like, "Hey, let's do a deep dive on product. Let's do a deep dive on customer support. Where's it at right now? What do you feel like your job is? What do you feel like are the issues you're facing? Where do you want to take it over the next three to five years? Then, let's talk about it."

(00:09:57):
Just forcing you to write it all down is really helpful, but then it forces you to explain it. It helps the rest of the executive team get better company execs because now they really understand product a lot more deeply, or understand finance a lot more deeply, whatever the function is.  

Lenny (00:10:15):
Speaking of gaps and opportunities for people in the company to level up, you've been highlighting this trend that I thought was really interesting, something you call the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager. Can you talk about what that is and what you've been noticing?

Casey Winters (00:10:33):
Yeah, sure thing. This is something I started noticing while managing PMs and product designers at Eventbrite, and it's now coming up with Whatnot as I help them hire new PMs, is the environment in which a lot of product managers have come up is very distorted from when you and I started doing this kind of work. I think we used to always describe PMs as this gang of misfits. We all started in all different functions. We all had different strengths and weaknesses, and the PM team gained as a whole from that diversity of skills and previous experiences.

(00:11:12):
What I noticed is, when we started doing product reviews at Eventbrite, if there was any sort of uncertainty in a problem or a solution, the product manager, instead of shipping to learn, would talk about all this research they have to do to really learn the problems, really learn the solution. 

(00:11:30):
My feedback would be like, no, user research is a scarce resource. We have to reserve it for the areas that have extreme uncertainty and high leverage for getting to certain, so if you're redesigning the login page for Eventbrite, you don't need to use that resource to learn what to do. Just go see what FANG and the top unicorns did. They probably did a good job, and even if they didn't, all of our customers also use those products, so they're going to be familiar with us copying any approach that they've taken.

(00:12:05):
I think we sort of forgot in the industry that many times, the fastest way to learn is to ship, so that if you actually get them to skip research and just go look at competitors, another thing I was noticing is I'd get a list of options other companies have done, but there would be no analysis of why those companies chose different options and what's most applicable for us. 

(00:12:31):
It got me thinking, okay, every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

(00:13:10):
At one point, I got so fed up, I wrote an internal blog post, and I called it On Best Practices and Breakfast Rituals. I talked about how there were these articles about the morning habits of the most successful people, and if you try to do all those things, it'd take you like six hours every morning. There was this article, I think it was on Business Insider or something, about this futurist at Google. He talked about all the pills and food he eats for breakfast every morning to try to live longer. The reporter estimated that it cost him one million a year to have these habits, so I was like, "Hey, I want to make it clear. At Eventbrite, we don't have that much money. We don't have that much time. There's no framework that allows you to not use your brain at this company and just follow some sort of process for success in this profession."

(00:14:02):
I adopted this thing into a public blog post that's on my blog now, but now that I've had some time outside of Eventbrite, I feel like I at least partially missed the mark on what's really going on. I see this with Whatnot, because one of the things I'm helping them with is interviewing, I see PMs again, which I haven't done in a while. It's fascinating interviewing a PM or managers early in their career because Whatnot is a startup, and you know better than most of us as a former founder of one, startups typically require us to wear lots of hats. You have to write SQL. You have to talk directly to customers. You have to prep marketing and sales. Most importantly, you have to make a lot of decisions under uncertainty, which you wouldn't necessarily expect a PM to do at, say, a Google, but it all boils down to using your brain in different ways.

(00:14:54):
Lisa, who's on our legal team, she called Eventbrite a public startup because the pandemic basically erased her business and we had to build it back from scratch. Now that I'm doing these interviews, and whether they come from a small startup, a unicorn, or a public company, they all sort of look the same because there's been so much funding to all these companies. Every company's been acting like they're Google with Google margins, meaning a lot of engineering support, a lot of design support, a lot of research support, lots of analysts around them.

(00:15:22):
They actually seem pretty ill-prepared for a real startup, or even a public company with some uncertainty around it like Eventbrite, so you start getting these weird responses in the interview process. You ask them to solve a problem and they'd say things like, "I can't even begin to come up with solutions until I see all the data and talk to customers." I'm like, "Yeah, I get that's something you would normally do if you took the job, but you don't have the data. You can't talk to customers. Make a decision now. What would you do? I want to see how creative you are. I want to see how much you're intuiting about the real problem and solution," and they can't really answer. 

(00:15:56):
Then my follow-up, which I don't ask, but what I really want to ask is like, "When's the last time you used your brain versus followed a process someone else designed at your company?" Because I want the former, not the latter.

Lenny (00:16:09):
Wow. Amazing. There's a lot of things I want to dig into here. I was going to ask why you call it zero interest rate phenomenon, but I think what I'm hearing is it's when interest rates are zero, everyone's got a lot of money, things are going great. Everyone looks like they're killing it, successful. Everyone thinks they've got it all figured out, and then when that goes away, it's like, "Oh, shit. Maybe not so." 

Casey Winters (00:16:27):
Then also, I think zero interest rates allowed every startup to operate like it was a public company with billions of dollars. That's going to go away over the next five years, and it sort of takes us back to what product management used to be like, which was you didn't have all these resources around. You didn't have all this time to figure it out because if you don't figure it out now and make it work, you may run out of funding, right?

Lenny (00:16:51):
Yeah. Like a very concrete thing that's changed as a lot of research teams have been laid off because they grew really large and companies found, "Maybe we need don't need the ..." Like, "Of all the things we can cut, it's probably an area we can cut." 

Casey Winters (00:17:02):
Yeah, for sure. 

Lenny (00:17:04):
There's probably PMs listening to this wondering, "Shoot, am I one of these? Am I just following a bunch of frameworks?" What's your advice for someone that may fear that, "Oh, shoot. This is maybe who I am and I don't want to necessarily be this"? What could they maybe do?

Casey Winters (00:17:17):
I always advise going to companies where you can learn quickly and try things. I think it's certainly okay to learn a bunch of frameworks. There's a reason I've invested a ton of time in Reforge because I think it actually really does help people to see how other people build things in a way that they can scale it to their other companies, but you have to understand that the job is not to follow the process. The job is not to learn every framework possible. The job is to figure out how to add value to customers that translates into value to the business. Just reorient your North Star, if you've gotten away from that.

(00:17:53):
When I joined Eventbrite, there was this team that didn't ship anything in a quarter. I went to the designer who I knew, and I know that he likes to get stuff out there and likes to get feedback. I was like, "Dude, you didn't ship anything. How could you have gone the entire quarter, not shipped any of your designs and felt that that was okay? If you didn't feel it was okay, why did you censor yourself? Come to me. Tell me why this team is not letting you ship. There's just no way you can get better as a designer. There's no way you can have the impact on the company. There's no way you can have an impact on our users." Those are some things that come to mind to that question.

Lenny (00:18:36):
If you're a PM on a team that maybe isn't shipping, maybe is overusing research, do you have any advice of just like when it makes sense to invest in research? Say you have the resources, is there a rule of thumb you have of like, "Okay. Let's actually spend the time on this verse not"? 

Casey Winters (00:18:51):
I think about it a little bit, depending on the type of job you have and the types of customers you have. The more scale you have tends to be you have less sophisticated customers because you're generally like a consumer thing where the customers are rational. They're not experts. That's generally where you just try things. You measure the impact they have, and you only really bring in USEARCH, research when the impact seems confusing, but you can run experiments. You can get data really easily, so bias towards getting stuff out there and seeing what users respond to.

Lenny (00:19:30):
In consumer product.

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
Right. 

Lenny (00:19:31):
Interesting. 

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
If you're super enterprise, it's the opposite. Each customer, first off, is sophisticated and tend to be rational. They're paying you like six figures or more, and you could talk to the customers and sales, who knows the customers really well directly, and they tell you want they want. They tell you what they're willing to pay for. You build it. They pay you. Bing, bang, boom. It's not, obviously, as simple as that, but you're basically doing the research directly with the customer and with the sales team, and translating that into things that are strategic to the business.

(00:20:02):
I would say those are the two extremes probably most people are familiar with, but we now have a lot of companies in the middle, where they have more customers. Those customers are more sophisticated. They're consumers. They're maybe employees at companies, or they're small businesses. That's where you have to be more nuanced. This, of course, is where Eventbrite was on, "Hey, when do I really lean in on research? When do I lean in on data? When do I pay attention to internal feedback?

(00:20:29):
" For Eventbrite, we really tried to focus research on the B2B side of Eventbrite, where the problems seemed big, but not well-defined enough. Or that problem's well-defined, but we just really don't feel like we have the right solution yet. If research is going to be a scarce resource inside the company, which I think it will in most places, you have to figure out where it's a high-leverage area, which means either really big problem, we don't understand it well enough, or we know the problem's big. We understand it well, but we're just not sure if our solution's going to, in any way, hit the mark. 

Lenny (00:21:06):
Makes me think about some of the best researchers I've worked with, and they often tell me like, "We don't need to do research on this. We have enough information. We have other things we should be doing."

Casey Winters (00:21:13):
I love it when they say that. Yes.

Lenny (00:21:15):
Yeah. This would have been a really good segue to another topic I want to talk about, which is around gut instincts versus team expertise, which we're going to get to, but I have a couple more questions along these lines. 

Casey Winters (00:21:24):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:21:25):
You talked about interviewing PMs at Whatnot. Can you actually describe Whatnot? Just because you mentioned it a couple times, just so people know what we're talking about here.

Casey Winters (00:21:33):
Oh, sure. Whatnot's a livestreaming marketplace, mostly focused on the collectibles market. Sellers, whether it's like baseball cards, or women's handbags, or sneakers, they'll go live on video and show you the products they have that they're selling. People that are watching the stream can engage with the sellers and bid on different items, so kind of like Twitch meets eBay would be a good way to describe it. 

Lenny (00:21:54):
Awesome, awesome. I'll just mention, I'm a tiny angel investor in that company. 

Casey Winters (00:21:56):
Oh, that's why you brought it up. Okay, I get it.

Lenny (00:22:00):
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure people understood what this word was because it's like a fun word, Whatnot. What I wanted to actually get to is you said you were interviewing a lot of project managers for them.

Casey Winters (00:22:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:09):
What is your approach to interviewing PMs? What do you find is a really good signal for someone that's going to be successful?

Casey Winters (00:22:14):
I feel like the whole thing's gotten so performative. It's like interviewing is handing out Oscars based on who's prepared the best tell me about a time response, versus actually assessing who can do the job we're hiring for. It's like most PMs are better PM interviewers than PMs now. There's this quote from a movie called The Way of the Gun. I don't know if you've ever seen it.

Lenny (00:22:35):
No.

Casey Winters (00:22:36):
Benicio del Toro says in it, it's like, "These days, they want to be criminals more than they want to commit crime." I think about that quote a lot when it comes to interviewing. I would say I'm a bit contrarian here in my approach. I don't ask about your work history. I don't care about your perfectly practiced answers. I'm going to give you real scenarios that I expect from the role. I want to hear how you'd approach them. If you can't come up with a few reasonable ideas, figure out how to test them quickly without analyst support or research, I'm just not interested.

(00:23:10):
I'm not saying this is a perfect approach. Interviewing is a very lossy format, but the more I can see them do the job we're hiring for with questions, whether it's a presentation, a prompt, that gets me the most comfortable that they know the job they're signing up for, that they've shown in a practice scenario they can do it, and they actually enjoyed it in some way.

Lenny (00:23:29):
Are there red flags you look for in these interviews? One is maybe you said of like, "I can't even begin to answer this without research and data." Is there anything else?

Casey Winters (00:23:36):
Some things I pay attention to is if they're talking about solutions that are going to take a long time to get signal from, whether it's months and months of engineering time before you actually see the impact on users or the business, I think that's always great. If they're not factoring in the amount of time it will take, in general, is not a good sign, and not thinking a bit more holistically about the types of metrics they expect to improve versus track to make sure they haven't gone down. Those are some things that I pay a lot of attention to.

Lenny (00:24:11):
How much do you think they're intimidated by being interviewed by Casey Winters? How much do you think that factors in?

Casey Winters (00:24:16):
I think you overestimate my importance or awareness in the community. I think most people have no idea who I am when they start talking to me.

Lenny (00:24:25):
Mm-hmm. [inaudible 00:24:25] Another thought is there's this meme that GBT-4, or 5, or 6, or 10 is going to replace product managers, and anytime some new feature comes out, people will put out these videos of, "Oh, look. They're doing all the PM's jobs." What's your take on the future of PM in AI, if any?

Casey Winters (00:24:41):
Well, I think if you thought the PM job was just filling in the latest Reforge or Shreyas framework, and then getting that automatic FANG promotion every year and a half, then yeah, you're going to get replaced by AI. I think the real PM job is the least likely to get replaced over time because you need real subject matter expertise. You need to be trading off a lot of different types of things, and making good decisions for the company and for your customers. 

(00:25:10):
In terms of using AI now as a PM, I'd actually be cautious in the current iteration of the cycle for PMs. It's a tool that's trained on sounding smart rather than always necessarily being smart. I was at Eventbrite the other day, and someone was telling me how they were loving the new Notion AI integration. She asked me if I used it. I said, "No." She's like, "Ah, you totally need to. Hey, go ask it your bio. It's really cool." I said, "All right. Let's just do it on your screen," so she did and my bio said I started my career at Google, and worked on Google Trends, and a bunch of other products, none of which happened. It was just complete nonsense.

(00:25:52):
It did have some stuff that did happen. It knew I worked at Eventbrite, and it knew I worked at Pinterest and stuff, but half of it was just completely made up. It sounded plausible, but it wasn't actually true. I think where I'm more inclined for PMs to try to get leverage out of something like GPT-4 is a lot of the tedious work that's maybe not their specialty to begin with. If you're not great at Excel or Google Sheets and you need to model something, you can ask it to format something. That'll probably be perfect, or how to get some Zapier integration to work. It probably knows how to do that really well.

(00:26:28):
I think, at this point, it's a pretty good no-code to low-code tool. It's obviously going to become a lot more than that, but for a lot of these other use cases that people are touting, there's a decent chance, confidently tells you the wrong thing, and that would scare me as a PM. 

Lenny (00:26:45):
I've had the exact same experience. I had to describe what I've done, and it was like 70% mistaken. 

Casey Winters (00:26:52):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:26:53):
Is there anything you've found value in yet with GPT of any kind in your work, or is it still kind of just poking around and novelty for you?

Casey Winters (00:27:00):
Yeah. I've had a couple of those things where it's like, "Hey, how do I actually get this weird thing done?" It's been like clear bullet points, take these steps, and I'm like, "Oh, great. This was actually really hard to find on Google." Things like that, I actually quite like it for, so that's where my head goes to more confidently use it. Of course, I'll try it and if it's wrong-

Lenny (00:27:24):
Just throw it away. 

Casey Winters (00:27:25):
... I'll learn where it's wrong, so it's low-risk, but it's been right on some of those things and it's like, "Oh, cool. I couldn't figure out how to do that." There was something on Google Docs that I needed to figure out how to do that was kind of fancy. I asked ChatGPT. It told me how to do it, and I was like, "Oh, great." 

Lenny (00:27:39):
I had a similar experience where I just needed a formula in Google Sheets, and just told it like, "I need this thing," and it just gives me the actual formula. 

Casey Winters (00:27:45):
Yeah, that's so magical when it happens. 

Lenny (00:27:47):
Yeah. I don't know. I'm not that good with Sheets formulas. Shifting course a little bit, you also wrote this really interesting post on founder intuition versus team expertise. There's a lot to it, and I think it's a really interesting topic because it's this classic discussion that startups have. How much should a founder trust their gut, and how much should it be top-down, "Here's what we should be doing" versus the team, bottom-up, figure out what to build? I'd love to spend a little time here. Maybe just to start broadly, what is this? You came up with a framework of how to think about when founder intuition should overrule, say, team expertise, and how that change over time, so maybe just talk about that. 

Casey Winters (00:28:26):
Yeah. If founders are lucky/good enough to find product-market fit, they've usually built up all this intuition about their customers, about their product, and their business that are really hard to explain to others and may even be subconscious. When they start to hire people, these people will come in with a lot of excitement, ideas, maybe even really relevant experience, especially senior leaders. I've seen some founders are like, "Cool. I need to let these experts start to own these areas and get out of the geek house." I think that's actually the opposite of what you want, because none of these people know the business as well as you get it. You actually need to direct them until they show you they've really got it and are making better decisions than you would. 

(00:29:17):
This is not a founder example, but I remember when I hired Erika Warren to build out our loyalty program at Grubhub, and she now leads growth at Change.org. After a month or so, she was like, "Dude, you're in all my meetings. I got this." That let me know she was in a different part of the situational leadership framework than I had put her in, so I backed away, and she crushed it from there.

(00:29:40):
Founders will put a lot of new leaders in that delegate bucket too quickly. It's like, "Ah, they got it. They know more than me," when founders actually know the right answer and should just tell them. This can, of course, change like in the case of Erika. If you hire the right people, they do get smarter than you. You can and you should start delegating. Many founders don't notice the signals where their founder intuition has been usurped by team expertise, or maybe it's just ebbed in effectiveness over time. That, of course, makes sense. Founders have all these different things they're dealing with, and your employees can really dive deep in certain areas. I encourage employees to proactively signal both directions, like, "Hey, I need direction from you." Or, "Hey, I got it from here. Trust me on this one."

Lenny (00:30:27):
Interesting. You're saying, as a founder, the heuristic should be if you feel confident about a decision, generally, you should be clear, like, "Hey, I think I know what we need to be doing here," and don't just make people feel better, necessarily, by just saying, "Okay. You tell us what you want to do." Then on the flip side, as an employee at the company, if you feel really confident about something, make it clear to the founder like, "I really think this is the right move." Is there anything more you want to add there?

Casey Winters (00:30:55):
Yeah. Well, there's obviously the feedback loop of that, of what happens when you do either of those things. Depending on the founder's response to that or the employee's response to that, there's different approaches you can take.

Lenny (00:31:13):
Part of this, you have this cool chart of just over time, the founder expertise becomes less and less relevant. I guess, is that because they just don't spend as much time with the customers because they have other stuff going on or they hire people that are smarter, and then over time, the team expertise goes up?

Casey Winters (00:31:26):
If you're lucky enough to scale a company, there's just more and more things going on that all will reach the founder in some way, but it means more breadth and less depth on any particular issue, and the reverse is true for people you hire. They're able to get really deep into things that maybe you were really deep into two years ago but you just can't stay deep in anymore. I built this chart on, or I guess I should say table on the different phases of a startup. When you're finding product-market fit, everything goes through the founders. You cannot outsource that.

(00:32:08):
Then when you start scaling the company because you found product-market fit, it's the first time that founders run into this classic problem of what got you here won't get you there. What got you to product-market fit was iterating on product and doing things that don't scale. Guess what? You found a product that works. Don't do that anymore. Make it scale. Don't come up with new products. You found the one that works. The reason I came up with this framework originally is when I was at Grubhub, we were scaling pretty nicely and fairly organically. 

(00:32:39):
I think Mike and Matt, the founders, had intuited these phases of building a company pretty well, but we acquired a competitor and I saw how that company we acquired operated. Even though they were largely in the same phase as us, they still operated like they were founding the company. Everything was going through the founder. Intuitively, I was like, "Oh, this is why we're acquiring you, and not the other way around." 

(00:33:09):
I think it's really hard for founders to get those signals organically, and I think it's up to us as employees to help. The founders can listen to the signals or not listen to those signals, but that's part of why we're here, but we should also give those signals when we're confident we really get it. Not come in day one being, "I know what your sales strategy should be. You're doing it all wrong." Because chances are, the founders weren't doing it all wrong. They knew something you don't know about yet.

Lenny (00:33:34):
What is it that you think made it such that you won and they didn't? Is it because they didn't invest, they didn't shift to scaling and delegating to their employees as much as the founder just telling everyone to do it?

Casey Winters (00:33:43):
Correct, right. Everything was not moving as quickly because everything had to go through the same person to get done. It just allowed them to not launch as many markets, not sign up as many restaurants, to not figure out as many growth channels, yeah, as we had done.

Lenny (00:33:59):
Got it. They just bottlenecked themselves and they weren't able to move as fast because the founder thought they needed to make these decisions, and they were still the ones that knew everything.

Casey Winters (00:34:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:34:09):
That makes me think about most companies. Maybe not most, but many founders just believe they have the answers. They are confident they know what to do, and it's rare they get to a place of like, "Nah, I actually don't."

# Lessons from scaling Stripe | Claire Hughes Johnson (ex-COO of Stripe)

## Transcript

Claire Hughes Johnson (00:00:00):
What I say to people at Stripe... In our onboarding, I used to run a session. I was like, "If you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you. And I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to like slow the whole company down. Follow a process and get it done, and don't forget to actually make a decision. And if you don't know who the decision maker is and you're worried it's not, you just ask. Don't get stuck." Too many people get stuck and it makes your work terrible, right? What do we all care about? Progress, impact, momentum. If anything I would say about advice to people generally is be a force for positive momentum and it will be actually a real career maker.
Lenny (00:00:50):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Claire Hughes Johnson. Claire was most recently chief operating officer at Stripe for the past seven years, where she helped scale them from a small startup to the legendary company that it is today. Before that, she spent about 10 years at Google where she was VP of self-driving cars, VP of global online sales, director of sales and ops for Gmail, YouTube, Google Apps, and AdWords. Before that, she was in politics. She's also on the board of HubSpot and the Atlantic. And this week, she's releasing an incredible book called Scaling People, which in my opinion should be and likely will be on every founder's bookshelf. In our conversation, we dig into many of the meaty topics that her book covers, including building your operational cadence, defining your company and personal operating principles, your company's operating system.
(00:01:46):
Also, tons of tactical advice around saying things that you cannot say, building self-awareness, distinguishing management from leadership, so much more. I say this a couple times in our conversation. If you enjoyed my newsletter and podcast and the fact that it's very tactical and full of templates and frameworks, you'll love Claire's book, and you'll love learning from Claire. I had such a good time chatting with Claire, and I know you'll learn a lot from this conversation. With that, I bring you Claire Hughes Johnson after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or are you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies.
(00:04:18):
Use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to vanta.com/lenny. That's vanta.com/lenny to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today.

Claire, welcome to the podcast.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:04:49):
Thank you, Lenny.
Lenny (00:04:51):
So you wrote this book. It's called Scaling People. It's coming out this week. I actually read a preview copy, and it's incredible. Everyone listening to this should buy it, especially if you're a fan of this podcast. It's full of frameworks and templates and guides and all these things that I try to do with my newsletter and podcast. And so if you like what I do, you're going to love this book. And I can't imagine how much work it must have taken to write a book like this. So my first question just have relieved are you that you're done with this book and you can move on with your life?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:21):
I am so relieved, Lenny. Writing this book was not my idea. Patrick and John Collison, Stripe's co-founders, really sort of pushed me into it. And I'm glad they did. I will admit that, as I am with most things they pushed me into, but it was a lot more work than I thought it would be, and it's very rewarding to have it done. Of course, though I've been re-looking at it and realizing there are things I want to add information or tweak what I originally said, but maybe we'll have to do a second edition. We'll see.
Lenny (00:05:55):
That's the benefit of a newsletter. I can just edit things and they're immediately live.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:59):
Yes.
Lenny (00:06:01):
I want to talk about John and Patrick a little bit. But before that, something I wanted to ask is I find that when I write stuff, I am able to better understand and crystallize my own thinking. And I'm curious, having written this book, what is it that you were able to better understand and crystallize in your own thinking through that process?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:06:20):
It's true, and it's funny, because if you asked me, I would've said I crystallize more by talking and speaking. But whenever I do write something down, I'm glad I did. So I probably do more crystallizing by writing than I would admit, but maybe I'm just lazy and I just like to talk. There's a part of the book, I think it's toward the end of the third chapter, which is about hiring, and that's a really long chapter. Turns out I had a lot to say about hiring and hiring leaders and processes and what you need want to set up. And as I got toward the end of the chapter, I found myself saying to the reader... You maybe have read this and thought, is she for real? You need to do all this work? You need to put all of this in? And I had to say, well, look... I started the chapter saying, if you believe that talent is everything, then your hiring process is everything.
(00:07:11):
And so yes, you do need to put that work in. But I think, Lenny, to your point, when you see all the templates and the frameworks and the examples and the advice from my career... And I was at Google for almost 11 years, I joined Google when it was about 1800 people pre IPO and left when it was about 60,000. I had eight different jobs while I was there. And then joining Stripe when it was about 160 people, and now we're over 7,000 people. Yeah, I have a lot of examples, but really what's crystallized is how much work it is to build, to build a company. You know this. And I hope this book is a bit of a shortcut, but there are no shortcuts. I hope it will accelerate people's knowledge so that they can get down to work with our product and with our customers.
Lenny (00:07:58):
There's a story you share at the end of the book, I think it's in acknowledgements, about how people went and took John Collison out for dinner and were just picking his brain, and "How did you scale Stripe? How did you build this amazing machine of a company?" And he often came back from these dinners, and he's just like, "Claire, they just want to talk to you. You did all these things, not me." And it sounds like that kind of encouraged you to write things down, and then led to this book. One, is that true? And then two, I'm curious, what else did you learn from John and Patrick Collison that have stuck with you? I imagine there's a lot, but kind of what stands out?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:08:31):
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think it is true that at Stripe, we're fortunate where we have so many users, customers who are themselves founders or interesting companies growing up around the world, whether at scale like Amazon or scaling. I've spent time with Discord and Toast and all kinds of interesting companies that are growing up around us. And a lot of their questions are not necessarily about Stripe's products always. They're really about, "Well, how do you guys do this thing?" Or "We're having this challenge. Are you having this challenge?" And John, yeah, would often come back from trips. He would travel more, and he is often probably meets with more customers than anyone in the Stripe leadership team, maybe other than our sales leaders. And they would ask about scaling, and he would joke. He's like, "We need Claire in a box." So I think the book is Claire in a box, I guess.
(00:09:23):
But Patrick also would have that same experience. And when I contributed a chapter to Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook, even though if you look at High Growth Handbook, which I also really do recommend not just because I'm in it, I'm probably the least, I don't know, celebrity participant in his chapters, and my chapter got a lot of traction because I think it was very specific. It was very tactical. And Elad actually helped me to realize, look, examples and details and frameworks, my working with Claire document is in there, is like... He said it's catnip. And I think that is also what inspired Patrick to push me to do basically a longer version of that chapter that I did with Elad. But I've learned a lot from both of them. I used to think that I was... My parents are teachers, Lenny. I used to think I was very curious, and I'm a learner and I'll seek out information.
(00:10:21):
And I grew up in a very educatory environment, right? Well, once I met the Collisons, the two of them are huge sponges, seeking out knowledge constantly. But also, anytime we were confronted with anything, even things I felt I'd done before, that I had the experience and we were going to build it, they were like, "Well, who have you talked to?" Or "What have you read?" And it was really good. I don't think I made enough phone calls in my earlier career and asked people's advice and asked for help and found the person who did that thing five years ago and found out what they learned. And I think that's probably my biggest lesson from working with both of them, is how much it pays to seek out knowledge from others because we're all just learning all the time.
Lenny (00:11:11):
Is there a story or example of that comes to mind that was really beneficial where you actually ended up follow that advice and reached out to someone, talked to someone, and that changed the way you think, changed the way you operate?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:11:21):
There are two things that just jumped into my mind. The first one is early on at Stripe... When I joined, we were about 160 people. I started bringing in some leaders. We were building out go to market, we were starting to stabilize our support operations, building out recruiting and HR, all the things. We were really growing. And it became very apparent that we needed to put in some kind of job structure. Levels and ladders is what you would call it, which is there are different levels of pay, and they have to do with your experience and your impact and their expectations of those different levels, right? There's an engineering ladder. And this stuff is probably making some people listening like their skin start to crawl because it's never fun or easy to define all that, and it's not perfect. You're immediately getting into something that feels pretty suboptimal, but it is worse to have nothing because it starts to feel very unfair in the environment, especially if you have to start to change up compensation and reward or reward systems, right?
(00:12:24):
So I realized, oh my gosh, we're going to have to put this in place. We didn't know HR people, so I basically ran a project. And the first thing I did though, thanks to Patrick and John, is I talked to Square, I talked to Airbnb, and I talked to two or three other companies. But those two conversations, I'm not going to say who said this, but one of them, the person said, "Oh, that's a blood bath." They were not encouraging about what we were about to go through. And another one said, "You know what? I'm so impressed that you're doing that so early. We waited too long." And actually, that's what a lot of my book. It's about is when should you start to think about this thing that you might need, right? And it's sooner than you think. And so putting in levels of ladders felt like ripping the off, honestly, but I was glad. One company I talked to waited until they were like 800 people, and it was apparently not fun because people don't like to be... Who likes to be categorized?
Lenny (00:13:26):
Yeah, and put it at a level that maybe they're not happy with, right? They're like, "Oh, I thought I was a lot more senior than that."
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:13:32):
Yep. Yeah, exactly. It's not easy. It's a form of change challenging. And I would not say we did it perfectly, but I'm glad we did it. I think that example was definitely one of them. Another was like we were really... We wanted to roll out 24/7 support in multiple channels, email, phone, chat in multiple languages and getting from where we were to where we wanted to be as quickly as possible. Not many companies have done at the scale, because Stripe has millions of customers. We're B2B, but we're B2B at a very high scale, which actually Google was as well. And so that was beneficial to me coming into the Stripe environment because I'd done parts of that for Google. And again, that's an example of something I thought I knew how to do, sort of, but we certainly didn't do it perfectly, and it's certainly different when you're talking about payments.
(00:14:24):
That's people's money. That is a business'... If they don't know how to contact you and they have a problem, that is a huge issue. And so I did seek out a lot of advice. And I would say... Did anything change dramatically what we did? I think if anything, the advice pushed me to go faster on some of my intuitions about, for example, using vendors and outsourcing parts of the model. And I realized we're not going to scale all this internally, especially not at the speed that we're going, but it's hard to start to use outside sort of contractors if you haven't filled figured out all your tools and processes. So that balance was sort of freaking me out, but you just got to push through it.
Lenny (00:15:15):
There's a couple directions I want to go, but I'll go in an unexpected direction. At Stripe, you're kind of infamous for your titles. When I created this career ladder document.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:24):
[inaudible 00:15:24].
Lenny (00:15:24):
Yeah, it's like everyone's product manager., They're like a VP of product potential and it's like product manager. What's the rationale behind that? I guess, and what's the benefit of that? But, we don't have to go too far down the road. I'm just curious.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:37):
So this is something that Patrick and I actually really agreed on without a lot of discussion, which is not always the case. It has to do with a combination of optionality as you scale and grow, and also culture, right? And so the minute you start titling a lot, you're signaling hierarchy and authority. And the culture piece to Stripe still today, which is I think we could use more, at least more overt trappings of structure because it can get confusing. And I'll be the first to tell you that, and I admit that this might have carried on too far. But early on, at Stripe, there's a real belief. It's not a particularly hierarchical company. And if you're the person who has the knowledge, you are the expert on the thing, you better be, one, in the room helping make the decision, and two, driving, helping to drive the decision. And I don't care how senior you are, right? And that was the cultural signal that was important, which was about mutual ownership, and also expertise not sitting in hierarchy.
(00:16:43):
And then the optionality thing is probably a little more obvious, which is don't make somebody the CMO, or even the head of marketing, if you're marketing team is two people, right? Yeah, you might make the right choice, but two years later, your marketing team's probably going to be more than two people, say it's 20. And are you going to have to layer somebody or have too many titles? And then someone feels like they're losing something, right? It goes back to the levels and ladder saying, but it's worse because you've given something, and then you're sort of taking it away, and that's just not... Organizationally, you want more flexibility. Honestly, I'll say my final thing, which is I have a little bit of a knit where you meet a company. I get what's happened, which is in order to hire this person, they had to sort of say, "I'll make you the VP of sales or the VP of this," but the company's like 25 people and there's seven VPs.
(00:17:40):
If you're a customer or you're evaluating it, you're kind of like, "Really?" It's a little incongruous with the scale. So we kind of more flexible. We had a lot of growth, head of this or growth lead. I know you're all about growth, Lenny. Well, we definitely took growth and find that very broadly. But the other thing I've said to people internally... Sorry, you can really get me going on this one. I bet you didn't think that. If you are a stripe and you're going out into the market, actually it speaks to the same thing, which is you're going and trying to sell to a customer who's a lot bigger than you. I'm not saying make up a title. Don't say you're the VP of sales, but you can be creative about how you represent your scope because you probably have really big scope because you're one of the only people helping to sell the product. And that will help you because a lot of more established mature companies are trying to do that hierarchy match, where "Well, bring your SVP because my SVP is coming to the meeting."
(00:18:42):
And we could be like, we don't really have that. It just gives you a little more selling flexibility too.
Lenny (00:18:48):
I like that. I like combo where you can just say something that fits in this situation, even though that's not your technical title.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:18:53):
Yes, you can say, "Oh yeah, I actually am in charge of optimization for our payments product." I'm sure you are. I'm sure that's what you
Lenny (00:19:01):
Do. Coming back to something you talked about with the career ladder, and I had a question around this, you talked about how oftentimes people do it too late, and I'm curious why it's so important to think about the stuff that you wrote about in this book so early in your company's life cycle. I think in the book you mentioned that it's oftentimes as important to get your operational structure and cultural structures in place incorrect as finding product market fit or finding your first few customers, which I think would surprised a lot of people. Can you talk about why you found that to be so important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:19:35):
Not only can I talk about it, I wrote a whole book about it, so let's try to restrain me. But here's what I would say. Obviously product market fit is the most important. And what I do say in the book is focus on that and don't get too far. My book is definitely not zero to one. It's more like maybe 0.5 to 1.5 or one to two. Because I do think when you're smaller and focused on product market fit and finding your user and getting that traction, that shapes a lot of how you work and your goals and who you hire, and that all makes sense. I think the thing that happens though is, one, some companies don't quite realize they're hitting it and they start to get behind on actually building the company part. Because guess what?
(00:20:23):
It turns out product market fit is just the product, and that is not a company, and that will not scale, to point. You see these companies that sort of fall over and there's sort of a bad article about them, and often it's not the product, it's the fact that they didn't actually build the company very well, and that started to harm, in fact harm the product and harm the mission. You have this vision, you're going to solve this problem with this product. And all of a sudden you can't solve it because you didn't scale the org properly. You didn't keep the cultural fabric strong as you grew, right? And so that's why I think it's so important. And so let's say you are hitting traction, and hopefully you do notice it. Because I think a lot of founders, you're kind of paranoid.
(00:21:08):
Like Stripe, I don't think Patrick and John fully embraced that they needed to start scaling maybe until I showed up, and that was part of hiring me. I was like, yeah, this is it. It's happening. It's not just look at the numbers. It's like look at the inbound support demand, look at the inbound sales leads. I just did the math, and I was like, this company should be probably twice the number of people it is right now, which of course freaked everybody out, but it was very obvious to me because I was coming in outside with that perspective. But more importantly, not just scaling things like sales and support... And as you probably know, if you work in payments, you've got a lot of other functions that are very important around risk and compliance and you name it, or the machine learning models and that help you do those things.
(00:21:55):
But for the sort of structures and operating processes that I talk about in the book, I do have this analogy which I think you picked up on to building a house, which is you have the supporting beam. Say it's a post and beam structure. You need the posts and the beams, and then you're going to have to do the mechanicals, right? There's going to have to be some amount of wiring in order for you. I don't know if you have your solar panels, but you got to bring in the heat, you got to bring in the cooling and plumbing, and then you have foundational stuff that you have to build or the whole structure will fall over. And I think of putting in the posts and beams and the mechanicals and the foundation as actually essential to scale. Because if you do those things well, you build them in such a way. This is almost like a Russian doll kind of thing, but you build them so that they're replicable, right?
(00:22:49):
So the way that you do goals as a company can start at the company level, and this is how OKRs were so beautiful for Google and they can replicate down to the individual. And the same common structure allows that to happen at really different levels of scale. And that's what you're looking for, is what are these common things? We do not a lot of them, by the way. You don't want to mandate a lot, you don't want to put too much structure in place, but enough that everyone can play with it up and down what I would think of as the stack of the company. And if you don't start putting those things in early, people will just invent those things. And then you'll have... Picture a house that got added on to 17 times and it's not even two years old. It looks not super stable. And then you're going to find yourself having to do a tear down, which I think we've all seen companies do that.
Lenny (00:23:40):
I definitely want to get into that house structure and all the components of it. But before we get there, if you're a early stage founder just looking for product market fit, maybe the skipping ahead a little bit, but which elements do you think are the most important that they need to do now? Because they're going to read your book, which gives them so much advice on all the things you can do.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:01):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:24:02):
If you have to pick a couple things that you have to nail when you're just starting out before product market fit, what do you think is most important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:08):
I think really that early, keeping it very simple and being focused on that goal of product market, which is like what is the problem you're trying to solve? What's your vision?Everything you have to do for an investor pitch deck matters not just for the investors. By the way, people forget this. A lot of the story you tell to investors, early ones especially is the story you should be telling internally to anybody you hire. Why do we exist? What problem are we trying to solve? What early customers have we attracted, and what's their feedback. That's what you mostly need, but you need to remember to share it and don't just use it for fundraising, or don't just use it for a board meeting or an investor meeting. Use it internally. And I think you can get pretty far actually with that core content. As you start to...
(00:24:56):
The first thing you're probably putting in place is a little bit of hiring process, and I think that's going to matter sooner than you think. Don't just be tempted to hire people in your friends. Think about what you need, what capabilities you need to build even pre PMF, right? And so as I said, there's a chapter about that, but I think some of the simplest versions of it is how do we evaluate talent? What kind of talent are we looking for? Where do we go look for talent, figure that out, and sort of train people a bit internally on interviewing. I think interviewing is not a skill that comes naturally. People think it does. It does not. And there's really basic easy tips and tricks you can find even on the interwebs about interviewing. And I really recommend... And my book has examples of rubrics, questions you can use. How do you really get at... Because it's hard to really evaluate someone in 30 minutes or 45 minutes.
(00:25:49):
So I think interviewing some of your fun fundamental early investor kind of content you need. But then when you start to get some traction, then you're showing to codify and actually document what I call more foundational content. Because if you're pre-product market fit, you're probably small enough that you just can tell everybody all the things. You don't have to send them the packet or have them sit in the onboarding. But the minute that you're starting to get any kind of hiring speed, you're going to want to document it more and you're going to want to start to put some very lightweight processes of how you get things done in place, because again, you're trying to replicate velocity. It's easy when you're all in one room and everyone knows like, "Oh, this is the most important thing to get done today," hack, hack and hacking away. But then pretty quickly, that is not going to be the case.
Lenny (00:26:38):
I definitely want to go one layer deeper on that, but there's this area I wanted to get to before we dive into some of the weeds around that, which is I found it really interesting that you started your book with this idea of personal operating principles versus here's how the company should work. It starts with here's how you should think about yourself. So I want to go... There's four of them... But before I get into them, can you just describe what is the idea of a personal operating principle and why is that important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:27:02):
Remember the book is about two things, company building and company structures, and all that, replicating all that good step and management. So the other thing that the book is really about is management tactical guides to... It would be easy to build companies if there weren't humans involved, right? But there's humans and they're complicated, and I'm complicated and you're complicated. And there are things that motivate us. There are things that demotivate us. They're not the same things, though Lenny and I, I think you and I have some things in common, but point is the book starts with you. And I think a lot of people think management starts with the team, or even the company. And actually, I think founders make this mistake. Founders think, well, it starts with my product. And yeah, but it actually starts with you. And so the book starts with sort of my belief system, which is self-awareness, which is the first operating principle. Self-awareness to build mutual awareness is actually the most fundamental thing you need to crack if you're going to succeed at company building or management, in my opinion.
(00:28:08):
But I would say I'm one of those people who has strong opinions that are pretty loosely held. This one is a strong opinion strongly held, which is the more that you can seek feedback, seek to understand your motivators, your strengths, your blind spots, your tendencies, and take that on board and expose it to others, you're going to be a much more effective company builder and manager. So it starts with you. And those operating principles that I articulate are sort of mine, but they're also foundational to the content of the whole book. I do think authentic leaders tend to have their own, right? Lenny, you probably have a few that you... You maybe have not articulated them all out loud, but I do have mine and they're in the book, but I think you would also find that some of them you could adopt. If you were looking for were some to start to use as a leader, I would hope that I've put forward a couple that might be useful.
Lenny (00:29:04):
I want to talk about these four, but while you're on that topic, what are ways to help crystallize your own operating principles? What advice would you give people to do this? Because to your point, people probably have them in their head, but they haven't really written them out.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:29:17):
That's right, they haven't. The book has an exercise that I recommend in it that's a little bit more about crystallizing your personal values, but that's kind of the place you want to start. And it's essentially there's a whole menu, and you can find these online, of say 70 or 80 different values. And by values, I mean family, ambition, impact competition. People value education. People value different things differently, by the way. And there's no judgment. You might value being a very competitive person and I might value collaboration above competitiveness, and that's fine. We probably would both be very effective in a team for different reasons, right? So basically if you take a list of values and you say, okay, if I had to pick 10 of these that matter to me, then if I had to pick five of them, and then you really force yourself if I had to only pick three of them...
(00:30:09):
And it's actually good to have this in a dialogue with someone that you work with or well, and you sort of had to explain, well, why? Why, when I'm really pushed, do I have to hold on to say education or learning as a value? Or why do I have to hold on to integrity as a value? And I tell a story in the book about a manager I worked with where transparency was a very important value to him. And the thing is you usually have a story behind that value, right? And in the book, I use the name Eli for him. Eli ends up sharing this story at this offsite that we had. And the transparency value actually was a little bit problematic to manage because Eli would tell everyone everything, including his team, even when we weren't finished with the plan, right? But Eli got up and told a story of being younger, like seven or eight, and realizing his mother was very sick, and no one really told him what was going on.
(00:31:07):
And then unfortunately watching the process of her dying and then being taken out to lunch by his stepfather and told, "Your mother is gone." And okay, well, your whole worldview kind of explodes when you hear that, and you're like, oh, okay, this transparency thing is really real. This was a formative experience for him and it has changed how he operates, and it will probably have changed it for his whole life. And if you can get to that point on your own, of telling yourself, what was the story? What was the thing that made this so important to me? Then you're starting to be in a mode of self-discovery and then you're starting to document, okay, if these are my three top values, and here's why. And then I think what you want to look for are my, what I would call my work style tendencies? And so you get your values, and then you sort of go on a... I'm sorry, I could go on about [inaudible 00:32:08]. I warned you. I wrote a book about this.
(00:32:09):
But basically, all these work style assessments, Myers-Briggs, DISC, Enneagram, you name it. And by the way, I would take all of them because I find that very good. I mean some of it's just data. You're just taking on data. But a lot of them come down to are you introverted or extroverted? Are you more introverted or extroverted? Where are you on that continuum? And are you more task, if you kind of picture a horizontal and a vertical, are you more task or people oriented? And so I would take your values, and then I would plot yourself. Am I a more extroverted task-oriented person, which means you're kind of a director, get what done kind of person? Or am I a more extroverted people-oriented person, which might mean actually you're probably great at being very charismatic and building some followership and maybe selling a vision? A lot of salespeople are very extroverted people oriented people.
(00:33:03):
And then you start to see, okay, if this is my sort of tendency in my default and this is my value system, what are the ways that I operate that really make up who I am and becomes almost a belief system. And my operating principles in the book, one is to build self-awareness, to build mutual awareness. Another one is say the thing you think you cannot say. I think that I've come to believe that often your biggest strength, one, is also your weakness, but two, is something that you don't know is a big strength because it's almost like breathing. For me, saying something actually fairly openly and directly but in a non-threatening way is a thing I do. John Collison actually once said to me, he's like, "It's so interesting when you give feedback, that can be actually pretty brutal, I leave feeling really optimistic."
(00:34:02):
But I don't mean to be brutal, but I think I can sort of unpack and say this thing, like here's my observation, here's going on, and it's not judgmental, it's not threatening, it's actually opening up an opportunity for people. So say the thing you think you cannot say. You would actually find that more of us can do that. And then I come back to distinguish between being a leader and a manager, which is something early in my career, I did not do well, Lenny.
Lenny (00:34:30):
Before we get to that one actually, just to briefly ask you a follow up question, because I love that you're getting through all four here. This is great. But I was going to ask, is there something.. So clearly, you're really good at saying the thing you cannot say, and I love that. Many people are not good at this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:30):
No.
Lenny (00:34:45):
Do you have any tactical advice for someone that is not good at this for how to actually say something uncomfortable?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:51):
I think the main thing is, and Fred Kaufman has this in his book, Conscious Business, this concept of a left hand... He calls it the left hand column, which is you're in a dialogue with me or you're watching a meeting happen, and you've got a running commentary in your head. And honestly, some of that stuff is pretty harsh, right? You do not want to open your mouth and just say that thing. But what Fred says is, learn how to detoxify the left-hand column. I would say think about a way to say that thing that you think you can't say. You've filtered yourself out, which I don't like. And I want you to think, okay, can I? And I think that the... Here are the tricks, a couple of them. One is, ask a question.Right? A question is not threatening. By the way, the question could even be, is there something we're not talking about? It feels like to me... And then you own.
(00:35:47):
So the next trick is you own it. This is your observation, this is your perception. This is not a judgment. I am not saying, "Lenny, I think you really botched that interview." That's not useful. If I said, "Lenny, you know what? I wonder if you missed an opportunity in that interview. Did you feel like you missed an area that..." And then you're kind of curious. You're like, "What do you mean?" And I'm like, "Well, I'm kind of looking at this with you, and I'm standing next to you and I'm observing it." Right? That's less threatening. So one, ask a question. Two, make an observation that you own. So if I said, "I feel like there's something we're not talking about, and I wonder..." Oh, I own it. "I wonder if it's the fact that these two teams both seem to have the exact same project."
(00:36:32):
I talk in the book about a meeting I was in where it was very clear that we had two teams in conflict, and no one was saying the thing that was really pretty bad. I was like, this is pretty bad. We have two teams that seem like they both own a piece of work and are in conflict with one another. But I would say if you do those two things, ask a question, own the observation yourself, don't pass a judgment, you will get way farther than you would've ever thought sharing. And by the way, that sharing, one, there's probably other people who just haven't, can't get it out of their head, and you have ar opened up a door that a lot of others can probably walk through. You're not alone.
Lenny (00:37:12):
You have this framework, I think you call it being explorer, not a lecturer. Is that what you just described? Is that how you describe it?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:37:18):
It is. And to me, what I just talked about was more of a meeting or a conversation scenario, but I think that this... I'm glad you brought that up. I think this is actually a very fundamental management framework of mine, which is in a one-to-one interaction, your job as the manager... First of all, too many people think your job as the manager is to be the expert and tell people what to do. No, actually, your job is to enable people to be their very damn best on your team. And you have to create an environment and a context and provide them information, and then you need to provide them a form of coaching. Now, again, I think people start think coaching is lecturing, like let me coach you how to make this Excel model. And sometimes they do. Sometimes someone comes to you and says, "Can you exactly show me how to do this thing?"
(00:38:05):
Fine. But most of management is actually exploring with someone. It is being curious. It is saying, "I have seen this pattern of your work. Have you seen this pattern? Is there something..." I have a whole other framework which is about hypothesis based coaching. I think intuition as a word gets kind of a bad rap, and I kind of get why, look, especially if you work with a lot of engineers, which I do. It's not particularly always data driven, but guess what a scientific hypothesis is? It's a well-informed piece of intuition. And I think too many managers wait until they have a million pieces of data to make an observation to someone about an area for improvement. Instead, I would say take some data, form a hypothesis, and then explore it with the person. Because if you're well intended, which I think any good manager is, I'm bringing up this thing because I'm trying to help you see it and tell me if it's true so that we can both help make it more effective, better.
(00:39:11):
One very light example could be, "I felt like in that meeting... How did you feel that presentation went?" And the person sort of says, "It's fine. I think I got through the material." You say, "Yeah, I felt like you were maybe a little bit nervous. I'm just exploring. Were you..." And by the way, the person could say, "Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no." And then you could back off, or you could say, "Oh, well, maybe it was just me, but I noticed some physical. Your leg was shaking a little bit, your voice, you were kind of repeating yourself." And they're going like, "What?" And you're all you're doing is holding up a mirror... And you have to own it. You have to say, "My experience of you in that meeting was that you seemed nervous to me. Maybe you were not, but actually maybe this is just a physical coaching thing."
(00:40:04):
Have you ever had that? I have a few people on my teams who do this weird thing. This is pre virtual world, but when they're sort of getting it uncomfortable in a meeting, they put back their chair up off the table, sort of exit the circle. And that is a very physically big statement. And they had no idea, Lenny. They had no idea. I'm just watching the meeting, and I'm like, oh my gosh, you're like four feet from the rest of the group because you do not like this topic. And what I need to explore with you is how do you vocalize that instead of physically exiting the room or exiting the circle? These are just examples. Sorry, I could keep going. But I really think that that attitude of exploration and mutual sort of collaborative, let's discover some things about you...
(00:40:54):
And by the way, it can be mutual. They can go right back at you and say, "Well, I observe this." Great. Great. I've interviewed a lot of people for the book, different leaders and managers from lots of different fields, but one of them was Reid Hoffman, who's a more typical. But Reid, we were talking about the other operating principle, which is management versus leadership. And Reid was pretty honest. He's like, "Look, I'm more of a leader. I'm not a manager." He's like, "I'm not a great manager." And then he told me the story. He's like, he had in his first company that he was building, he had a guy that he'd hired who was more operational. And Reid was sort of making an observation to him about something they should do, and the guy goes to him, "Reid, I wouldn't hire you to manage McDonald's."
(00:41:42):
And Reid was like, "Okay, good. So tell me what we need to do so we can fix this thing." But what actually Reid's operating principle, interestingly when unearthed that whole thing, was that he prides... It's very important to him to create an environment of open feedback. He said, what I love about that story, yeah, it's funny and embarrassing, but actually that guy was comfortable saying to me, "I wouldn't trust you to manage a McDonald." And I think that actually I found inspiring because I don't think everybody who founded a company or who's managing someone has created an environment with how much trust in it, right? And that's how Reid thinks he gets a lot of stuff done, is people just come right back at him with the feedback.

(00:43:19):
So we've done three of the operating principles that you personally use, which I love. I love that you're going to going through [inaudible 00:43:25]
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:24):
Distinguish management and leadership is the third one, yep.
Lenny (00:43:28):
And then just to summarize real quick, the second one was to say the thing that you cannot say. The first one was-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:34):
Say the thing you think you cannot say, yeah.
Lenny (00:43:36):
And then first, build self-awareness to build mutual awareness.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:39):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:43:41):
And what's cool is you're sharing all these amazing stories and tactics. In the book, you actually have templates to do each of these things for yourself. So a lot of this is pointers too. If you actually want to do this, go check out the book and you can actually do this. It's not just in a bunch of high level stuff. And then the fourth is-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:57):
Come back to the operating system.
Lenny (00:44:01):
Let's talk about it.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:44:02):
So this one is, sort of like I was talking about, touchstone documents that you might create for your company. This is our operating principles, our values. This is my touchstone, which is I think that especially high growth environments, but every environment you operate in can get really chaotic, and there's a lot of ambiguity. There's a lot of stuff you don't know, and it's kind of easy to get paralyzed or to sort of give into the chaos. And you're like, oh my gosh, I don't know what this day is going to bring. I'm just going to randomly assign some stuff, and I'm just going to get through it. And all you're doing in a lot of those moments is creating more chaos. And I think a really important role of definitely managers, but some leaders too is to create a stability when there doesn't feel like there's a lot that's stable.
(00:44:52):
And where stability comes from is in ritual and in common practices that you share. So we set quarterly goals or monthly goals. And that's a ritual, and that's a thing we do, and it's actually a source of stability. And yeah, it feels like a process. It might feel like a way of managing, but it also has a cadence to it. And I think one of the things that happened is you picture yourself sort of spinning out of control. You think, how do I come back to this is the order I do things, this is how I get decisions made, this is how we make plans, this is how we make decisions. Those touchstones are not processes to run the thing. If they're done well, they're stabilizing because they're a common way of approaching that everybody has, so they can at least hold onto that even when all the other stuff is going haywire.
(00:45:45):
You've got a customer churning, and you've got a big launch happening the next day, like, oh my God, oh my God. Come back. What's our launch? How do we launch products? We have a way of doing that. We do not need to spin out of control and reinvent the wheel here, right? And that's a stabilizing thing. And the other thing on come back to the operating system for me was, as my career scaled, as I went from a individual contributor, to managing a small team, to managing a bigger team, to managing multiple teams, to managing managers, you get it, I realized actually, and I started to have multiple functions. So I was context switching between... At Google, there was a point where I had some product people, industrial design operations, really BD, really different functions. Actually, how I fundamentally ran them at the bare bones, at the house architecture level was the same.
(00:46:38):
And that gave me a stability as a leader where I would dive into a meeting. I'd be like, all right, let's look at the metrics that matter. We all had... We had them for every team. Let's look at the goals we set. And that also helps you stabilize when your contact switching between seven different projects or seven different teams. And so I wouldn't say it's the operating principle that I talk about the most, but I think if you were like, "What's your sort of... How do you scale yourself?" I would say, "Well, I actually have a common operating system like a computer, and that is how I maintain a sense of stability."
Lenny (00:47:17):
Perfect segue to the next kind of broad area I want to spend time on, which is this house metaphor and the three components of it that you talked about. And this is like the core of the book. Can you talk about again, the three kind of pillars of this house structure? And then let's just go through each of these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:47:33):
Yeah, it's definitely, the beginning of the book is about company building, and the company structure chapter is all about the sort of supporting beams, the mechanicals, and then the foundational stuff. And interestingly, it's sort of, well, I guess when you build a house, you build the foundation first. So one is the founding documents that you might create, which I'm happy to talk about. And then another are the supporting structures, which are some of the ways you do things we talked, like quarterly business reviews or OKRs, or how you use planning to create a structure that everyone... And then the mechanicals are what I might call the operating cadence, which is essentially the rhythm of how you work, right? The calendar, the year that we all experience tends to dictate a little bit how we work. Mondays feel different than Sundays, right? Well, companies have that same kind of a cadence, which is often also calendar driven, but also can be event driven.
(00:48:28):
We've talked often at Stripe about how our customer event, which we have called Stripe Sessions, is as important internally as it is for the customers because it's a forcing function for our cadence, how we plan our products, what we want to have achieved by that point, what we want to demonstrate. And that's true for a lot of companies, but we actually use it in our thinking about our cadence of the year. And actually, we've built this other event that I usually help run, which is an internal event that happens generally about six months before that, which is great because you can demo the stuff you think you want to demo internally. You sort of create a cadence of we're going to push ourselves to do some crazy wild stuff, internally demonstrate it, and then see if we can externalize it by the time we hit the customer event.
(00:49:16):
But that is a cadence. Quarterly business reviews are part of your cadence, et cetera. So that's the fundamental, but really while I'm trying to do is say, one, I don't think this stuff is super hard. You know this. It's kind of hard work. It's just putting it in place, and then actually using it. I think where a lot of leadership teams go wrong, especially of young companies, is they experiment with different vehicles to try this stuff. And then they either don't actually follow them or they throw them out the window after they haven't tried it for very long, and it creates a lot of chaos. So I would say do very few things consistently and try to do them well, and then see if they're working for you, and then once a year, maybe think about a revision. But don't keep throwing out new things you heard that other companies do. And it turns into a weird grab bag of operating stuff. You're nodding because you've seen this too lot.
Lenny (00:50:16):
Yeah, I think a problem I've seen is people think there's going to be this perfect system and process that's going to not have any flaws, and they're always like, "Oh, it's not perfect. We got to optimize it further." And what I find is it's always just like, this is the best one you can come up with at the time. This is the best idea you have now. There's going to be flaws. Just work around those flaws. But just know there's never going to be the one thing that works.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:50:35):
There is no one. There's no perfect org structure, there's no perfect operating approach, there's no perfect, yeah, performance and management and level system. But having one and committing to it is good. And don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Lenny (00:50:50):
There's another, you mentioned that I thought it'd be fun to talk about, that it's often chaotic at a company. I imagine people think about Stripe from the outset, like, oh, they've got it all figured out, so smooth, just runs like a machine. And I think people look at other successful companies and they're like, man, things are so crazy at our company. This isn't normal. But I think, you tell me if I'm wrong, most places are crazy and chaotic internally for a long time and often, right?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:51:15):
Yeah. There are different kinds of chaos, but it's so true. What is that? There's like a saying. Don't ever believe your best press or your worst press. It's never as bad as whatever someone's saying it is never as good. It's just normal is not pretty. It's a lot. And that is true. It's happening everywhere. I used to have a friend who was building a company. We would see each other. We both were from the Boston area, and it's a long story, but we'd end up on the same flight off in Rhode Island, coming back to Boston occasionally for stuff, for family. And we'd be in getting yelled at by the passengers because we'd be in the aisle of the airplane comparing notes about stuff that was broken.
(00:52:02):
And we had this expression, it was like, oh, and then I picked up the rock, and under that rock were some really ugly, creepy crawlies. But that's just like the way it is, is it's never perfect. But I guess I would go back to what I just said about having some stabilizing ways of doing things because that can create, I don't know, I'm not trying for a perception that the thing runs a machine, but more of a, that is a well run thing, right? And how do you create that perception? Because you adhere to some ways of running things and that are consistent, and it feels better even to the outside, even if there's a lot of chaotic stuff going on.
Lenny (00:52:45):
Coming back to the founding documents, could you just talk about what are in this group of founding documents? And I think even more interestingly, what's a sign that you should invest more time in this area as a startup?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:52:55):
Yeah. Very classic stuff is in here, nothing that you haven't seen or examples of. So one is I think it's good to have a mission. When I joined Stripe, we did not. It came to be apparent that to increase the GDP of the internet was probably the mission, because people kept repeating that back to us, and Patrick had written it on some website copy early on. But it was interesting that candidates and customers kind of grabbed it. It was very Stripe because it's a little bit intellectual and pointy headed and aspirational, but also it is... The GDP does involve economic progress, which we're all about, right? We're building infrastructure for commerce and payments for not just the internet actually. But anyway, point is have a mission, or at least the beginning of what's your one line of what you're seeking to accomplish.
(00:53:47):
And then I'm a big fan of writing sort of what we Stripe called our long-term goals, which were just not our short distance, but our longer distance, like why did we exist? And so the mission is one line, so you need a little more meat behind that, right? And actually, I think if you looked at our long-term goals, which by the way I thought would be a three to five year goal, I would say they're still relevant today. But one of Stripe's long term goals is to advance the state of the art and developer tools, which would not be something that everybody, especially every customer of would initially call out. But when you think about it... Lenny, you just did it. You think about it for a minute, you're like, yeah, the API and the docs and a lot of stuff that we've open sourced, Stripe cares.
(00:54:38):
Our forever user is fundamentally a developer. It's the person who's integrating Stripe, right? By the way, simple integration, complex integration, anywhere in between, we really care about their experience, and we care that the tools are excellent, because how are you going to increase the GDP of the internet if you don't advance the state of the art of developer tools? Right? Anyway, point is articulating that, because until I said that to you and I could talk about it with you and say you came to work at Stripe, you might not understand why we invested in certain things or why it meant so much to us in terms of our user experience and the mission. So articulate those things. And some of them might be a little bit aspirational, but they should feel at least real enough that you can have that conversation about... You look at anyone who works in a company, what they choose to do all day with their time should be guided by things like, what are we trying to accomplish?
(00:55:35):
What are our long-term goals? So if they don't know them, how are they going to make the right choices? So that's one. And then another is a lot of companies write company values, or at Stripe, we wrote operating principles. I think you had [inaudible 00:55:50] on, and she talked about these, and we even sort of took a version of ours and put them out for candidates so that they could evaluate, do I want to join this company, because I kind of want to know what it's like to work there? And I think that's really valuable to do because not every company is right for every candidate, and the more you can mutually match the better. But having some operating principles matters. I think you can go farther than that, but that's where I would sort of start, is those three things.
Lenny (00:56:17):
Awesome, I like the simplicity of this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:21):
How you know is people are asking you. Especially new hires are asking you a lot of questions about what's important, or "Why do we do it this way?" You said it yourself at the beginning. Doesn't writing something down, crystallize it? Time to write it down and crystallize it for everybody who works there.
Lenny (00:56:40):
And just to summarize you as a mission, your operating principle/values. What was the third one?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:45):
Yep. Long-term goals.
Lenny (00:56:47):
Long-term goals.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:48):
And sort of more details on why you exist. What are you really trying to accomplish?
Lenny (00:56:52):
Interesting. And then are those numbers in your experience, or is that a story of what [inaudible 00:56:57]?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:00):
Those are a little bit more, I think headlines. And I think your shorter term goals have numbers against them, right? So if you looked at your long-term goal, which might be... Another one of Stripe's is about accelerating globalization, and if you thought about what would that require, that would require us to be in a lot of markets. That would require us to have users and customers in a lot of market, and also to eliminate friction across borders. So those things, which is a very high friction thing, unfortunately in payments, and moving money, which it shouldn't be if you want to advance globalization, accelerate it, right? And so that can then become numerical goals and short term goals.
Lenny (00:57:41):
Basically objectives, and then-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:43):
Yeah, it's sort of the longer term objective, and then the key results part is early is shorter term. But actually, if you're having trouble writing your company goals, actually zooming way out and being like, "If we're going to meet this mission, what do we have to accomplish in the long term?" You can then walk back from that and be like, "Oh yeah, every goal we ever have probably fits in these three to five buckets." Bam. And then you write your short term goals actually more easily because there's always going to be one about, say, international expansion. There's always going to be one about additional products because we're trying to do X, and you can't do it with one product, or whatever. You can imagine the example.
Lenny (00:58:22):
Awesome. And I know your book has a actual examples of a lot of this stuff.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:25):
It does. It does.
Lenny (00:58:26):
So again, pointer to that. Okay, so that's the founding documents. The next piece is operating system. Maybe we go there, just what fits into an operating system for a company? What are the components of that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:38):
I think a lot of the components we've sort of touched on, which is do you have some sort of goals? This is now goes back what we were just talking about. For Stripe, we have an annual set of numeric targets that we put together, we have a system of goals or OKRs, objectives and key results, but sort of like what is your structure for setting milestones that you want to achieve, whether they're numeric or more like a binary, we got this thing launched, we didn't? And then QBR, so quarterly business reviews. How do we review parts of the business? What is the cadence? Well, first, what is the form by which we do that? Which would be this... I share examples in the book of this might be the template you fill out if you're a team and your reporting on how it's going and versus your strategy and your goal.
(00:59:24):
And then there's also getting into metrics and dashboards. What are things that you look at internally to measure progress, the input metrics and the output metrics? And I give some examples of that. And then mostly, I think there are other... As I said, there could be less frequent forms you use, like a user event or a launch, a way of launching products, et cetera, but it's really simple. It's mostly goals and how do you review the business. Planning. I talk a lot about planning, which is. You said this earlier, and you and I think both agree, which is there's no perfect process to plan for the next year or the next two years, but you still need to fight your way through having something, especially after a certain stage. And every COO I meet with, we sort of ring our hands together.
(01:00:11):
We're like, oh, planning and everyone hates us, too burdensome, but you still got to keep trying. You got to do it. And so we talk about planning processes and what they might look like and how you set them up. And then that's how you'd use goals and QBR to measure against the plan, right? So those are some of the operating systems. And then the cadence is just how often do you do these things? Actually, one of our big lessons, I think companies that are moving quickly and that are younger tend to resist some of the calendar based cadences of more mature companies because they seem slow. You're like, really? You're going to just achieve that goal in three months? Or are you artificially restricting yourself to some lowest common denominator of time? And so I get that fear, and I would say your cadence doesn't have to be one quarter or one six month, or even 12 months.
(01:01:08):
Stripe, we did sort of six month processes for a while. So instead of a year, we did it in six months. Still, there were things that took, by the way, a year or longer, but I think that play around with the timeframe and don't feel restricted by what other companies do. But one of our lessons on the QBR was sometimes those quarterly, because that stands for quarterly, those quarterly business reviews were too infrequent, especially for new product areas. They we're still in development. They were still getting a lot of feedback, launching a lot. And so we just said, okay, they're not quarterly anymore. They're like every six week business reviews. Fine, change your cadence. The point is to have one, because then it's predictable for teams. They know what they're marching toward, they know when they're going to be reporting out, and they can set their goals in a way that makes sense to make progress in that timeframe.
Lenny (01:02:02):
One quick question there. What's a sign that your cadence is off? What's a flag that we should go shorter or longer?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:02:10):
Well, everyone usually complains about these things, but I think if the... One, nothing, like you said, it's probably too fast if not enough progress is being made in between whatever your review or your reporting function is, and it's probably too slow if the content you're reviewing seems stale. And you're like, "Well, we knew this," or "We already did that thing," or "Yeah, we already had the meeting where we talked about that." That's another thing that's interesting, is some companies will have a pretty frequent metrics review cadence, and then an infrequent strategy review cadence. And what happens is the metrics review becomes the strategy review because you're not talking about the strategy often enough. And so you're talking about it through the data, and so then by the time you get to the strategy review, you're like, we already had this meeting. And that's just a sign that some things are just off. And to me, it's about timeliness and freshness of the content, but also that there's actually new content. If there's not new content, you're creating work for people. By the way, give them time to work.
(01:03:12):
And so I think don't fool yourself that thinking, having more frequent checks on things is going to actually make things run faster. I would say that the opposite can be true. And so be very wary of actually slowing velocity down by creating overhead. One thing we try to do at Stripe is if we're looking at metrics, let's just look at your dashboard live. Let's not create a special presentation. I actually just share your screen please on your dashboard, right? Which is a good discipline, because one, that means you have to have a really good dashboard that's real time, that's web accessible. No one had to pull or massage the data. That's a good sign. But it's also, you're not wasting people's time prepping all that information, which happened even... By the way, at Stripe, even when we put that in place, we still ended up with versions of that problem.
Lenny (01:04:04):
Yeah, [inaudible 01:04:05] I think mentioned that. I think there's a term for it, data something, where you randomly get chosen every week and someone has to present your data.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:04):
The metrics review meeting, yes.
Lenny (01:04:10):
And it's like the next day, you're going to have to share your meetings and [inaudible 01:04:12]
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:12):
Yes. We called it the spin the wheel, the spin wheel on who gets to present. But that has a logic in it, which is then you're not working. So just prepare it.
Lenny (01:04:26):
Right. That's awesome. I love that policy. There's so much more I want to chat about. There's chapters on hiring, self-development, personal development, all these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:34):
Team development. Yep.
Lenny (01:04:36):
What was that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:36):
There's a, yeah, intentional. There's a team building.
Lenny (01:04:40):
Team building.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:40):
And performance management.
Lenny (01:04:41):
Yeah. Okay, so we could go through all that stuff. Instead, I want to talk about the COO role broadly.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:47):
Yes.
Lenny (01:04:48):
I asked on Twitter, preparing for this chat, what people wanted me to ask you about it. And most of the questions ended up being about the COO role and things like that. So I just have a few questions lined up here for you.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:48):
Sure.
Lenny (01:04:58):
Okay. So Amir [inaudible 01:05:04], with little accent at the end there, he asked just at what point do companies need a COO, and how would you judge if someone is a fantastic COO?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:05:12):
Oh yeah. Well, I would first say most companies, if you looked at the universe of all companies, do not have a COO. I think it's fewer than 20%. It's definitely fewer than 30. And I think that's something to know, that I don't think it's an automatic role to have or hire. And I think you see it in more prevalently in earlier stage or high growth companies. You also, by the way, see it in certain business models. I actually think Apple was an interesting version of this, where Steve Jobs was oriented in terms of product and design, but also that Apple has... It's very intense to manufacture software and hardware that then works together. I learned that when I worked on self-driving cars at Google, and you need a very intensely operational, detailed manufacturing, hit the marks, hit the timelines person. So I think some businesses that have a very deeply operational, say a manufacturing component, that role might be more prevalent.
(01:06:19):
But point is, it's not an automatic. I think it's useful in a high growth... In an environment where you're having... Think about the founder/CEO of a company that is achieving product market fit and also having to build a company, and hire all the leaders. That is a lot because you are building the product and the business, you are building the company, and you are building all the people, bringing them all in. And that is where I think a COO type of role can give you leverage, which is... Essentially, it's a layer that takes some of those functions and helps build them with you and on your behalf, and also in some cases, bring some experience in maybe there's a particular function like go to market that needs to be built. And I think that's where you see it come up. What I've said to some people recently is I'm a little worried, just like there's a mythical founder, that there's some mythical silver bullet COO hire that everyone's like, "I will just find that person."
(01:07:20):
And first of all, we're all human beings. I'm not perfect. I certainly did some things well when I joined Stripe, and other things not as well, and I'm working on my self-awareness of what those things are. But I would say one lower risk strategy could be to bring in, say, a head of business operations or a role that's sort of COO like and try a couple of functions with someone and see if they scale with the company and with the role, and then maybe you decide they're a COO. I mean, I mentioned Stripe's business operations team. You could hire a business ops leader and sort of say, "Hey, build this team to help be the Swiss Army knife to help scale the company, and then maybe that turns into more." Or there's some CFOs that are quite operational. They could take on more scope sometimes.
(01:08:11):
But I think there are other paths to getting that leverage, and there are also ways to de-risk the hire because you could end up searching forever, right? And I worry that it's become too much of a panacea in people's minds, like somehow they're going to find... And people will call me, and they'll be like, "I just need to find you." And I'm like, "One, I may not be right for your company, but two, that was a lot of work, and I think we actually, in the end, maybe got pretty lucky." How would you know someone is fantastic? Someone said something very smart to me, which was... I was in a meeting. It was me and Patrick. So Patrick is the co-founder and CEO of Stripe. And they said that having just the right amount of tension in our relationship was how you knew it was working for the company.
(01:09:03):
And it gave us both a little bit of pause, but we ended up having quite a good conversation after that meeting, which is there has to be mutual understanding and trust and an ability for Patrick to say, "Hey, can you go do this thing?" And then believing, I will do it at the level of quality and intensity and intentionality that he would like. But there also has to be some friction, where I would maybe say, "No, I'm not going to prioritize that. I don't think that's important for the company," or I'm going to give you feedback that I don't think we're doing this well, or he's giving me feedback. The customer experience is suffering. All your scale stuff is degrading this thing, right? So fantastic is not all hunky dory. Fantastic COO is just the right amount of friction intention with forward momentum and mutual trust, because then the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, right? That's what you're looking for.
Lenny (01:10:03):
I was actually going to say, I've worked with some founders, and they have this concept that they hire a COO, and they would just solve all these cultural issues they're having these relationship issues. And sounds like that's exactly what you're saying, is that that is not often the solution to some of these deeper issues.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:10:18):
Well, that would be the other problem, is actually believing... I was getting recruited, Lenny, and people would... Essentially, I felt like the founders were saying to me, "I'm going to give you all of the things I don't like doing as your job." And I was like, even if I'm by the way not qualify to do all those things, number one. And two is sometimes that list would be quite long, and that would make me nervous. I was like, "Do you really not running a company actually? Is that what's going on here?" And really, I think they weren't confronting elements of their work that needed to evolve and change. And what I loved about joining Stripe was... I think people also think, "I'm just going to hand all this stuff to this person and..." I'd love to say I took all this off of the Collisons plate, and Billy and John and the other people who were there at the time, and no, we actually were more collaboratively worked together, and I think it helped...
(01:11:18):
Well, one, you don't feel as isolated because you're in a team, but also there's more joint work than people realize, I think at least in the companies I'd like to work for.
Lenny (01:11:30):
For the final 10-ish minutes we have together, and you have to run-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:33):
Yes.
Lenny (01:11:34):
... I was thinking I could go through just a rapid fire set of tactical questions and see maybe one piece of advice you would share with someone that's maybe struggling with this thing.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:44):
Okay.
Lenny (01:11:45):
And the first is from a also Twitter person, Manuel [inaudible 01:11:52]. And he just had a question around, as you're scaling, keeping alignment strong is challenging. What would be something you'd recommend to someone that's scaling quickly and trying to keep people aligned?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:02):
Well, a lot of what we talked about, having common codified documents of what we believe in, how we work, and then using communication practices very intelligently. Never think that one communication, meaning an email or an all hands, reaches the audience. You have to be smart about how you communicate.
Lenny (01:12:23):
Awesome. Amazing. On a different podcast, we talked about how the leaders are often the repeater in chief, just having to repeat the same thing again and again.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:30):
Yes. And just like a marketer, use different channels. Some people read emails, some people watch videos, some people attend the meeting. Repeat.

# Bending the universe in your favor | Claire Vo (LaunchDarkly, Color, Optimizely, ChatPRD)

## Transcript

Claire Vo (00:00:00):
People often think that I get hired into later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company, and in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup.

Lenny (00:00:11):
Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:00:16):
I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster. If you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half.

Lenny (00:00:24):
There may be a trend happening here of combining engineering product.

Claire Vo (00:00:27):
I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design speed. What is best for the organization?

Lenny (00:00:38):
You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there.

Claire Vo (00:00:44):
Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably.

Lenny (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Claire Vo. Claire is a longtime chief product officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. She's also been a two-time founder, engineer, designer, and a marketer. She's also the creator of ChatPRD, which I suspect is the most used PM-specific AI product out there, which she builds on nights and weekends.

(00:01:19):
In our conversation, we dig into what PM skills AI will complement and potentially replace in the future, the story behind ChatPRD, and Claire's advice for how to stay ahead of the curve on AI within the PM role, the importance of feeling agency over your career, and how to bend the arc of the universe to achieve the things that you want to achieve, insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an exec, how she creates a fast pace within larger companies while also keeping the bar very high, the rise of the CPTO role, combining product and engineering under one leader plus a ton of career advice both for early career people and senior leaders, and so much more.

(00:02:01):

(00:04:16):
Claire, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Claire Vo (00:04:20):
Oh, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I'm even more excited. You're someone that, to me, has always felt inevitable would be on this podcast and that we'd be doing an episode together. Do you feel the same way, or not? And it's okay if you don't.

Claire Vo (00:04:32):
It's a privilege and a pleasure, and I'm glad I'm here. I've been so impressed with your guests and your content. It's been so exciting to see just the wide range of product leaders and thinkers in this space. And if I can be on a list of product leaders and thinkers in this space, then I'm doing something good. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:51):
It's absolutely my pleasure.

(00:04:53):
I want to start by talking about career advice. I was perusing your LinkedIn, and your career path is basically what most PMs probably dream of in their career. Just to summarize, you went from associate product manager to product manager to senior product manager to director to senior director to VP to SVP to chief product officer, and now you've been chief product officer of three different companies. And along the way, you're a founder, you're a designer, you're an engineer.

(00:05:22):
Here's my question. If you had to boil down what you think your secret sauce has been to progressing so far and so quickly throughout your PM career, what might that be?

Claire Vo (00:05:33):
Yeah, so when you list it all out, you can probably guess underneath it all is a relentlessly curious, impatient, eager to build person at their core. I just like building stuff and I find a lot of fun, and I think if you find a career or a craft that's fun, it's easy to accelerate your growth in that career. One thing, I just love what I do.

(00:05:56):
But when it comes to career growth and that progression from, I actually started as a copywriter of all things, copywriter all the way up to a CPO or CPTO that runs an engineering organization, it boils down to something really simple, which is know what you want out of your career, be clear and ask for it, and then make it easy for your boss or whoever can support or champion you to get you from here to there.

(00:06:20):
And so I'll take a really specific example from earlier in my career, where I had been in management for design and product management, so a senior manager level over product and design at an e-commerce company, and worked very closely with growth and marketing. We were just two sides of the same coin and worked very closely. And the head of marketing left and there was this big to-do pretty quickly of, "Well, what are we going to do with marketing? And do we need to hire somebody?"

(00:06:49):
And I sat for about a half a day and I thought, I think I can help here, drew out an org chart, put my name on the top, walked into my boss's office and said, "This is one potential solve of your marketing organization question, is we'll bring product and marketing growth together. I can be in this position. Here's how I'd change the management structure underneath this. Not just where do you put me, but where do you put everybody else? And I think this could work for the company, and this is how I'd suggest we roll it out and this would be my JD." And I got that job. I think when people ask me about career advice, they want to hear, "What can I do?" Really, what do you want? And how do you make it as easy as possible to make the case to your boss to get you here to there?

(00:07:33):
The other thing that I give people advice about is know what you want out of your current role and know exactly what you want your next role to be. And I even know this, and I even say this to my boss. When I was VP of product at Optimizely, I said to my boss, "I want to be a chief product officer. Here's how I'm going to get us here to there, and I want you to partner with me on it." And even coming into this role when I was interviewing at LaunchDarkly, my boss, Dan, the CEO of LaunchDarkly asked me, "What do you want out of this role?" And I said, "I want my next role to be a CEO role, so I want this role to fill in my gaps, learn, help me elevate my experience to get me to that next step."

(00:08:14):
And so I always know what that next role is going to be and I'm always clear about it. Now, I think there's a fine balance here. There's one thing to be very clear about your goals. It's another to suck the oxygen out of the air about only talking about getting promoted. These are probably 0.005% of my interactions with my boss are about my career growth and my path. It's very small. "Am I clear? Are we on the same page? And am I communicating as I'm making progress against those goals?"

(00:08:44):
High-slip people I think get promoted basically as fast as the org can support. I've almost never wished I promoted somebody earlier. I've seen managers or folks promote a little too early, and so as somebody that's managing their own career, you have to be a balance of ambitious and assertive and take care of yourself and advocate for yourself, and the work needs to speak for itself at the end of the day, and that's what's going to drive for your career growth. And so know what you want but do the work and produce the results, and you can have a career like mine.

Lenny (00:09:24):
Maybe first to summarize, some of the core advice you're sharing is know what you actually want because you're not going to progress towards this amazing future career if you don't actually know where you're going. Otherwise, you'll be pushed in directions that you're not necessarily interested in going.

(00:09:38):
I have a sense of where you want to go to tell people and ask for it. "Here's what I want to be doing in the future. Help me get there." And I love the other point you made of just, don't over-focus on that. There's many people that spend a lot of their energy on, "I need to get promoted. How do I get to the next level? I deserve the next level." And I guess maybe along those lines, is there any other advice you could share of just how to avoid being that person that's just constantly obsessed with promotion? Any more advice of just how to find that balance?

Claire Vo (00:10:06):
Yeah. One, you've got to lock to the norms, the talent norms of your organization. You should know how those things work, and they can work very casually if you're a very small startup and they can work more formally if you're at a very large company. And one, understanding how promotions operationally happen inside an organization can help you have those conversations at the right time in the right moment with the right context. That's one thing I advise. We're a slightly larger organization. We do promotion cycles. We have times during which we promote people. And so if you're talking to me four months before a promo cycle, maybe it's top of mind, maybe it's not. I sometimes functionally cannot promote people inside larger organizations whenever I want.

(00:10:52):
One is, I think, understanding the talent calendar of your team, especially at a larger organization. I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, "I want to be promoted because I want to be a director of PM, because I want to become a manager, because I need direct reports." Instead of saying, "Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here. I have a lot of credibility with this side of the product organization. I think we could be doing more if this position existed. And I think I'm good for this position because of what I've proven A, B and C."

(00:11:43):
That's solving a problem for the company. That's not solving a career growth issue for an individual. And I think people who want to be promoted need to think in that orientation versus the other, because honestly, especially now, let's say [inaudible 00:12:01]. There are not just these wrote every 12 months we're going to give comp increases and merit increases and you get to be promoted. We really have to be thoughtful about the structure and size and organization of teams. Product teams are naturally pretty small.

(00:12:19):
So, there aren't just management and director and senior director roles to go around. And if you want to get into a management, for example, you have to prove that you're good at organization design. I think really focus on why a role is good for a company or necessary for a company and then why you are the best for that role, rather than, "I want to get promoted."

Lenny (00:12:41):
That is such good advice and such important advice that focus on how do you solve problems for your manager and the business, not, "Hey, here's what I need for my career. This sucks. My career is stagnating." I love that. And I love so much of your message is empowerment. It's not just, here, there's the place you're in and there's not a lot you can do about it. Look for opportunities to help your manager, help your business. "Here's what I can do to move things further."

(00:13:06):
And I think there's an element of timing that you touched on. Propose this at a time when something could happen. You shared this example of there was a marketing gap.

Claire Vo (00:13:15):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:13:17):
Is there another example where you did this sort of thing where you presented, "Here's how I can help the org," and that helped another promotion? If not, that's good.

Claire Vo (00:13:25):
It's honestly how I expanded into leading engineering teams in the technology organization. I was at Color and there was a real need to up-level our engineering organization, and I knew exactly what to do. I had high confidence I had the skills, both technical and organizational, to scale the engineering organization in a way that was really critical to the business, both from a architecture perspective and from a team and talent perspective. And so that was one where I knew there was a problem to solve. I knew that problem was important. I knew we had to solve it fast, and I was confident I knew I could do it. I had confidence that I could help there.

(00:14:06):
And so I'm still doing it today. And at Color, I came in as product. I very quickly began leading the engineering organization, which was fabulous, and then I actually took on some of our non-clinical operations as well where we had a pretty operational leader. We had some high-scale challenges to deal with, and it fit my talent set and I knew I could help the company pretty quickly.

(00:14:32):
And this is the other advice I might give particular to PMs. PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role. That was actually my first director role. It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing and I had to develop skills there, but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career. And so I do think also looking left and right outside of your scope of product can be a really effective way to find growth opportunities.

Lenny (00:15:08):
I love that advice, and it leads to so many unexpected opportunities. One of the, I think, big questions with PMs, and coming back to your original advice of know where you want to go, there's so many directions a PM can go. You can eventually become a founder, become a GM, become a CO, something else. And trying these sorts of things often helps you understand, "Here's what I'm actually excited about. Maybe I want to move into design."

Claire Vo (00:15:31):
Yeah, and one of the other things that I think people don't understand, and maybe I experienced this as a founder and I really feel it inside companies, is the universe is bendable to your will. And what I mean is in most, at least in the stage I operate in in startups and growth stage companies and late stage startups, organizations are very fluid and I like to organize around talented motivated individuals.

(00:15:58):
And so just because we're organized in a particular way now, just because these organizations are separate or these are different, together, doesn't mean that's necessarily the way they have to be, and so you should think about your career growth in the existing structure of the organization. But as an org design thinker, it's a very important job that I have to do. You also have to think of this system as a living, breathing entity that can shift over time in particular around highly motivated, highly talented people.

Lenny (00:16:30):
And I think along the same lines, referencing this advice you've already shared of just thinking from the perspective of what is my manager and folks above, what are they struggling with and how can I propose, "Here's a solution that happens to also have me move into a more interesting role?"

Claire Vo (00:16:46):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:16:48):
There's a direction I wasn't planning to go into, but I think it's really important and interesting is people like you that are incredibly good and successful end up taking on a lot, and that often ends up not being what they want.

Claire Vo (00:16:58):
SOS.

Lenny (00:17:00):
Exactly. Any advice on the classic, be careful what you're good at advice? Any advice on just how to not end up with everything?

Claire Vo (00:17:08):
I really believe operating in your zone of genius. I really believe in leaning into strengths. And if you are in a position in which you're good at things and you've been giving a lot of responsibility, but you have tremendous growth edges and you're spending more time on the things you need to level up than the things you are exceptional at, I think that's not fair for the organization. I think that's not fair for you.

(00:17:32):
I truly believe defining and understanding your zone of genius, where you are exceptional, where no one else can step into the job and do just as good of a job as you can, and where you derive tremendous intellectual emotional joy out of the work is what makes it sustainable over time. And so I don't actually think it's about the volume or breadth of the work. It's about sustainability of the work. And can you show up every day energized and engaged and excited about what you do?

(00:18:04):
And I think being very aware if you are operating the space or if you're not. And this might go back to, I think, I have never regretted promoting somebody too slowly, I have regretted promoting somebody too quickly. High-slope individuals in particular areas want to get more responsibility, want to have more scope, and I've seen less experienced managers or directors or even people at my level want to give opportunities that put people in a position where they're neither effective nor happy. And so I think being self-aware of that is really important, and then I also think as a manager, being cognizant of that is really important.

(00:18:50):
Individually, I do do a lot, but I do feel like I'm in my zone of genius and I also know that part of staying in my personal zone of genius is having this breadth of responsibility but preserving builder time. And what I mean from time is I have to have time to produce real work that comes from me as an individual, and that means that calendar management is quite important. Time management.

Lenny (00:19:21):
We're going to talk about some of the things that you built.

(00:19:23):
In terms of finding your zone of genius, any advice for someone that's trying to figure out what it is that is in that zone of genius? I know there's a Ted Talk of here's how to think about the zone of genius specifically [inaudible 00:19:33].

Claire Vo (00:19:32):
Yeah. I'm not going to relay it in precision, but one of the tactics that I've seen out there is basically go through your calendar for the last month or quarter, whatever it is, write everything down, and basically group them into, I hated doing this, I didn't love doing it but it was fine, I love doing this, and then I love doing this, and if I could spend all my time on this, I would be the happiest person in the whole world. And literally categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, "How can I be here more?" And often, that is a true guide to where your passion is, where your special expertise is, and where you're going to add a lot of value because you're highly engaged.

(00:20:26):
I think the other thing is really asking yourself, and this maybe goes back to the career advice perspective, really asking yourself, "What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?" There are lots of things that I do that other people in the organization can do, but what are the things that I do that are... You think about a differentiated product that are hard to replicate, and knowing what that is and leaning into that can drive a lot of exceptional career growth but also just make you quite happy.

Lenny (00:20:58):
What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:21:00):
I think I'm actually quite good at traversing across and up and down. What I mean is I am fluent across product engineering, design, data and operations, and candidly revenue in a way that vertical or functional leaders maybe are less so. I feel like I have a high level of fluency broadly and can bring conversations between functions together against a business objective pretty easily. It's just the way I'm wired. I was a founder. It's second nature.

(00:21:31):
And the other thing that I think I can do pretty well that I find very joyous is traverse elevation. And so, yes, I love to be up here and think about strategy and vision, but I also like to drop into the details to move things forward. And I think that operating horizontally and then being able to spend some time in the vertical up and down, wherever that vertical up and down happens makes me quite happy. I think I'm pretty good at it.

Lenny (00:21:58):
Amazing. We're going to touch on some of these things you just mentioned actually, but real quick, you mentioned this idea of essentially an energy audit. There's actually a really good guide that I'll point to in the show notes by Matt Mochary that walks you through how to do this. And we talk about this a bunch on this podcast actually, this whole idea of just find things that give you energy, do more of that. Find things that zap you of energy, do less of that. Easier said than done when you have a job and you have to do stuff that people are paying you to do, but it's still really helpful if nothing else to help you point you where you want to be going in your career long-term.

(00:22:29):
Okay, so you mentioned you're a founder, and it feels like you're a founder at heart, but you've been working at larger companies for a while now. And I hear that you're really good at setting a fast pace within larger companies and maintaining that startup focus while also having a very high bar for quality and product. Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." Why would we not want that? I'm curious just what you actually put into practice concretely that allow for you to build teams that move really fast and maintain a high bar. Are there processes you find helpful, values, ways of working?

Claire Vo (00:23:06):
Yeah, it's really funny, people often think that I get hired into the roles that I get hired into in later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup. And so I think about it completely differently.

(00:23:23):
And there are two things I think about in terms of pace and high bar. From a pace, it's know what your internal pace is, and essentially don't let it degrade to the pace of your recurring meetings. I often find that pace of organization locks to pace of the calendar, and so I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, "Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting," it's, "No, we should discuss this now. We should decide this tomorrow."

(00:23:58):
The other thing that I think about is setting one click faster pace expectations inside an organization. I tend to come in and love this, hate it, it's what I do, which is if I look at an organization that is operating at a lower pace than I would expect, I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster, which means if you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half. If you think it needs to be done this half, it needs to be done this quarter. This quarter, this month. This week, today. End of day, in this meeting. And actually setting an expectation that your natural pace is going to be slower than your ambition and being explicit about pulling things in I think can change the way expectations are set and honestly change the energy and momentum in the organization.

(00:24:51):
The third thing on pace is personal SLA. I never want to be a bottleneck for the organization. This is one of the more challenging things about being in my role, is you are often a point of decision-making, tie-breaking, next steps, approvals, socialization. And if my personal SLA is slow, then the rest of my organization cannot be as fast as possible. I try to be fairly responsive. I try to say, "Do both very high rate," and also very quickly. It's really hard, sometimes it's not totally possible, but it's a goal I have.

Lenny (00:25:27):
I love this clock speed concept of just let's move one iteration faster than we would normally move. How do you actually do that? Is this just you doing it and then everyone trickles down from the way you're approaching it? Is this a principle on a team? Is there a phrase you use?

Claire Vo (00:25:41):
Yeah, it's a phrase I use and something I asked our leadership teams to do. It started at, one, I'm going to do this, and two, my expectation is you look for opportunities to do this. And the reason I think this is effective, it's very tangible and it's very tactical. It just is one of those things that a moment when you're about to say a due date, you check yourself and you go, "Is this right or do I need to pull it in by an iteration?" And so it's a very tactical piece of advice and expectation I give to my leadership team. If they can show up that way, then the expected pace of the organization goes up, and then people tend to rise to the occasion.

Lenny (00:26:26):
And then it connects very directly to your first piece of advice, is not rely on the meeting cadence to determine your action cadence. I imagine that's a similar situation where you tell people, "Here's how I want to operate," and then you actually work that way and that starts to filter through.

Claire Vo (00:26:41):
Yeah, I just think there's this anti-pattern of, "We'll make the decision in the next meeting," or, "We'll follow up on this in the next meeting." That is an artificial timeline introduced by Google Calendar or whatever calendar you use. It's not a real thing, and so I want to put us on real timelines. When can we make the decision? How much information do we need? And that doesn't mean that every decision is made now, today, tomorrow, but it does mean we don't snap to artificial cadences to make our product move forward.

Lenny (00:27:12):
Awesome. Let's talk about quality. What are some lessons there?

Claire Vo (00:27:17):
Yeah, I think in terms of high bar, there's probably two things that I think about as a leader. There's the talent bar being exceptionally high, and then there's the product bar being high.

(00:27:28):
I'll start with talent, which is, on the talent side I think you have to define the bar. You have to be really specific, and that means you have to think about pretty deeply what are your leadership principles? If your leadership principle is bring the clock speed up one iteration, be explicit that that's what you expect to see, and then articulate that and hold people accountable to it.

(00:27:51):
And so I do think it's really important to have a specific and measurable career ladder, especially at the senior levels. I often find that they're very soft. They're hires and manages multiple departments or takes in cross-functional stakeholder feedback. Those are just not tractable, specific things. And so I think, PMs, put on your product definition or OKR hat or whatever and define some real goals for these levels and be specific in a way that you can look at people and say, definitively, "Yes. Measurably, yes, they're meaning this bar measurably. No, they're not meeting that bar." And so I think that's very important.

(00:28:39):
The second thing I think is you have to normalize feedback. And Brené Brown, fellow Texan, love her, "Clear is kind," I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar. They just do, because the expectations are not stated and you're not holding accountability. And I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers. That is not helping them become the best teammate that they can become.

(00:29:08):
I really like to normalize feedback and, as I say, take the temperature out of the room when it comes to open and candid feedback. And that means being very clear when people are not meeting expectations, making it very clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent. And I think that has something that people need to hear to normalize feedback. But I think feedback is quite important.

(00:29:30):
And I think the third thing is unfortunately when you're working to build a high talent bar and high talent density, then when folks aren't a fit and it's not working, moving against that quickly is part of the job. And it's a hard part of the job and it's part of the job that most managers really avoid, but I think it's important because it keeps your overall team operating in a really healthy, effective, performant way that makes everybody happier, including people that probably weren't a great fit for the work of the role at the time.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Is there an example of you being surprisingly candid to someone or giving feedback, hard feedback, to someone about quality, something that's just like, "Oh wow, that's what I should be doing?"

Claire Vo (00:30:16):
There were two leaders in my organization, I won't say which ones and I won't say when, but two leaders in the organization, partners across product and engineering, and they could not get it together. They could not work together. They were having misalignments and priorities strategy. They could not communicate. They were having conflict in front of the team.

(00:30:38):
And the managers that had managed them were taking this very soft pedal approach of, "You need to work on your [inaudible 00:30:47] functional stakeholder, and here am I expecting all this performance management stuff to happen." And I called both of them individually and I said, "The way you are operating is not meeting our leadership expectations. If you do not change, you cannot be part of this organization anymore. I believe you can operate differently. I do." And I did. I believe these are very talented people who could operate. "I believe you can operate differently, but it is your responsibility to do so, and I need to see change starting tomorrow."

(00:31:20):
I wanted them to succeed. And in fact, they did. It snapped in, they got it, and one of the... Turned into one of the most influential effective managers in our team over the course of probably the next six to nine months. And I think just clearly saying, "You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path. I believe you can get here, but it is your responsibility." That is the conversation that is clear and kind and honestly very effective in most instances.

Lenny (00:31:55):
That's an amazing example. Clear is kind, as you said. It reminds me of Kim Scott, who's on the podcast, shared this story about Bob. I don't know if you remember that story at all of just this guy at their company who was just doing a bad job and everyone knew he was doing a bad job, and then they had to fire him. When they're firing him, he's just like, "Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone tell me that nobody thought I was doing a great job?"

Claire Vo (00:32:16):
And I honestly think saying, "You are not doing a good job," is much kinder than, "I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect." Or, "I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at..." That's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else.

Lenny (00:32:36):
Okay, let's go in a different direction. Let's talk about being a woman in tech.

Claire Vo (00:32:40):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:32:41):
This doesn't get talked about a ton on podcasts like this. I know you have a lot of thoughts. Obviously, you've been through a lot. You've had a lot of experiences. There's probably a lot of stories you haven't shared in other places, so I just want to give you a chance to share what you've been through, what you've seen, and any advice you may have.

Claire Vo (00:32:58):
Yeah, and I'm happy to talk about this. I know a lot of people don't want to be defined or consistently asked about being a woman or a mom in a C-level leadership role. Let's not have women in tech panels anymore. But I've been reflecting a bit on this lately because I just came from a few years in healthcare, which, from my experience, it's a lot more women in leadership roles. I was a little spoiled, even in our technology organization. And now, I'm back in startups and tech, where the ratios are completely opposite, especially in roles like engineering, which is a team that I run.

(00:33:30):
And look, this is just, it's math. I think Carta said that 13-something percent of founders last year were women. It's declining year over year. FEMA led founded teams, or at least 2% of venture capital, women hold 30% of senior leadership org roles. Women are 30% of software engineering teams. This is just math. We're just facts. We're not in the room in the equal proportions. And as somebody who has, despite the numbers, had a fairly successful career so far in technology, I feel like I owe it to the industry to say it hasn't been easy and it's still not easy, even at my level.

(00:34:09):
And what I want to be clear about, because it gets talked about a lot in forms like this, this is not about imposter syndrome. How could I have any right to imposter syndrome? I've proven myself. I've been a founder, I've raised venture capital, I've had a successful exit. I've been, as you said, a CPO across increasing large teams. I get to invest in red companies. I'm on boards. I get to be on this podcast. I'm a TikTok influencer. This is not about feeling like an imposter. It's really about, it is hard and it is different, and the numbers pencil out in a way that is not favorable to women.

(00:34:47):
And as you said, there's been a lot of stuff in the past that you look at me now and you say, "Oh, she did associate and all the way up," but I had to fight for my all-girls school to carry computer science at the same rate that the all-boys school had it naturally. I grew up in teeny tiny startups in the early aughts. I saw some nonsense. I had VCs tell me, "Don't get pregnant," when I was... These things happened. And yet here I am, and it's fine.

(00:35:21):
And I'm not complaining. I just think what people also don't understand is that stuff still happens. I don't need to litigate who it happens with, where it happens. It still happens. I have arrived and it still happens. And the reason I bring this up is I think it should be a point of reflection for industry, and I think it can be a really effective point of reflection for women who want to get into leadership roles.

(00:35:46):
And the way I approach it is I'm just very curious. I wonder what is structural about technology that creates these things happen? What is cultural? What is external? What has happened to me or happens around me? What is internal? What do I bring into the room that doesn't serve me? And so I try to stay very curious. And then constant product thinker, what are the points of leverage I can use to move things not just forward for me, but for the industry broadly? How can I influence thinking? Where can I not? Where can I walk away from things?

(00:36:24):
And then as for the internal aspect of it, I think this is also a very powerful thing, which is I try to stay in an empowered space. I know my value. I have no time for imposter syndrome. It's not a constructive thing for me, but I do think knowing that, as I said earlier, the universe is bendable to your will. There are things we can change. I don't think these numbers are not tractable. And so my recommendation and what I'd love to say to the industry generally, to women in particular, is curiosity and empowerment have been my path to joy in this sometimes complicated industry. And I think there's a lot better we can do. There's a little bit of ways to go.

Lenny (00:37:10):
Is there a story that you could share if you're comfortable of just something you've gone through or been through that maybe people are like, "Oh, wow, I see what stuff she's dealing with or other women are dealing with that I had no sense of?"

Claire Vo (00:37:21):
I've been trying to wrap my head around this one, which is I consistently get asked if I'm technical enough. Not even if I'm technical enough. Let's put enough aside. If I'm technical. And it's fascinating to me because as a technical co-founder of my startup, I wrote code for the first 12 months solo. I led the engineering team there. That code is still in production in very large environments. I have run multi-hundred people, engineering teams for many years, and I spend my Saturdays and Sundays shipping code. This is what I do. And truly, the first question most people ask me is, "Oh, well you're not technical though. You're a product person."

(00:38:11):
And I've been really trying to unpack where that is coming from. It's hard for me to imagine somebody else that looks different, that has a different name, that has a different gender getting that question with my background. And so that's one of those things that has really been spinning my head. Again, it's not about imposter syndrome. I don't have anything to prove to people, but I am quite curious where that orientation comes from. And if it comes to somebody like me, who has really had some proven success, I know it's happening to other people, and I'm hoping that I can do something from my position to turn that a little bit.

Lenny (00:38:50):
And this connects to what you shared, the advice you had of just try to get curious about why it's happening, which is exactly what you just said. Is that just mostly to help you not get upset and frustrated? Let me just understand, why is this happening again and again?

Claire Vo (00:39:02):
One, I do think sitting in your power is very effective. And so curiosity means that I'm in control, and I do think I'm in control more than I'm not. That's one part of it is, I think. And the other thing is I think a lot of this is it's complicated. It's structural, it's cultural. It's what you see and what you don't see, not just in the workplace. It's what you see and don't see in media. Am I reading my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old books of, "My grandma's a software engineer?"

(00:39:35):
Books called the Mom Test, which I actually think is a great book, but it has this underlying presumption of who is technical, who's not, who understands things, who doesn't. And that all bubbles up into how individuals experience an industry that's driving tremendous economic growth here, where at the end of the day, it's about economic participation. It can be about individuals and aspirations, but it is also about economic participation.

(00:40:00):
The reason I'm curious about it is I do think it's complicated and I do think you can be successful, but I don't think we're being successful at the rates I would love to see. And I think we're missing a lot of innovation and a lot of economic growth by not having incredible, technical, capable women start companies and lead organizations. And so I think we're all missing out for that, and I'd love to see more of it.

# Succeeding as an introvert, building zero-to-one, and PM’ing your career like a product | Deb Liu

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of.

Deb Liu (00:00:11):
Some of the best PMs I have ever worked with are terrible PMs for their career. They just drift from job to job. "Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what does success look like? How are you going to get there?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
You wrote this awesome post about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert.

Deb Liu (00:00:28):
The workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. It looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because it's self-promotion. But instead, what if I called it educating about all the great work your team has been doing? Helping people see why your team should get more resources, you have to actually share what you do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Is there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe?

Deb Liu (00:00:49):
The most important career decision you make is who you marry. Is this person lifting you up or pushing you back? You will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Deb Liu. Deb was VP of product at Facebook where she spent over 11 years and while they're created and led Facebook marketplace, which is now used by over 1 billion people monthly, she also led the development of Facebook's first mobile ad product for apps and its mobile ad network. Also built the company's games business and payments platform, including Facebook Pay.

(00:01:23):
Prior to Facebook, she was director at both PayPal and eBay. She's on the board of Intuit and for the past three and a half years, she's been the CEO of Ancestry. I actually generally have a rule of no CEOs on this podcast, but to me, Deb is a great exception because she's a product person at heart. In our conversation, Deb shares a ton of tactical career advice, including why resilience is so key to career success, how to PM your career like you PM your product, how to be successful in business as an introvert, what she's learned about building multiple billion dollars zero to one businesses within a large company like Facebook and so much more.

(00:01:59):
Deb is so full of wisdom and I'm really excited to share her insights with more people. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Deb Liu.

(00:02:18):
Deb, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Deb Liu (00:02:21):
It's wonderful to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:23):
It's wonderful to have you here. You have had such an incredible career. You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of and honestly just like one of those roles is a dream for a lot of people. And so I wanted to start with just this question and I want to see where the conversation takes us. If you could give one specific piece of advice to someone that's looking to do well in their career or to do better in their career based on what has worked well for you, what would that be?

Deb Liu (00:03:02):
Always be learning, and I tell this to everybody, so I often tell people, someone who's always learning is always going to exceed someone who's the expert today. You're going to find people... The one thing about school is that we go to school and there's such a thing as getting a hundred on the test, a perfect score on the SAT, graduating with a 4.0. Well, there's nothing like that in careers, right? We think it's actually a non-linear experience and there's always something better than you at speaking or presenting or strategy or execution. But if you're always learning, learning from the best, getting feedback, you're always going to get better every single day.

(00:03:35):
And that's what I have always held, which is each job I took, I didn't necessarily qualify for it. I wasn't necessarily the very best at it, and so it became the student of being better at that job. And once I mastered that, I was a student for something else, something else and something else. And so I always balanced learning and impact, which was you can have the most impact, the job you know the best, but then you stop learning. And if you're learning all the time, you're not necessarily having impact.

(00:04:00):
So how do you keep going back and forth and back and forth so that you're not going straight up a lot or you're actually laddering back and forth into different things where you're having an amazing time where you know everything and then you're the newbie again and learning new things, and you're incorporating what you used to know into what you're learning and the impact that you have today and so on and so forth.

(00:07:03):
You talked about you got into a new job maybe you weren't ready for and you had to learn on the job. So either maybe share story one of those experiences or just like how do you actually do this? So someone's listening, they're like, how do I learn? What am I learning?

Deb Liu (00:07:14):
We'll start with my career in tech. So I had worked in consulting before business school. I went to Stanford for business school, came out to California, didn't know that much about tech, but I really loved using eBay. So I interned there my first year in business school and then when it came to finding a job, I really wasn't sure what we wanted to do, but we wanted to move back to the East Coast. And so I wasn't looking and I couldn't find a job. I think it was really hard. It was 2002. And so I ran into Tim Wenzel and Catherine Wu. So Catherine Wu was from Airbnb as you might know her. And Tim Wenzel put together the PayPal Mafia. He was the recruiter for PayPal.

(00:07:51):
Went to this table and I said, "Absolutely love PayPal, use it all the time. I'm a big seller on eBay," and he's like, "Do you want a job?" I'm like, "No, I'm actually going back east. "And he's like, "Just come in and talk to us." And so I said, "Okay. Well, what kind of jobs do you have?" And he's like, "I have jobs in product and I have jobs in marketing." Now, I've taken marketing class obviously in business school, and I said, "I wonder what this other product job is."

(00:08:12):
So I look over at Catherine and I've seen her around Stanford before, so she was a year ahead of me and I said, "Well, what do you do?" She said, "Product." I'm like, "That sounds good. I'll do that." And that's actually how I fell into product management. Well, I actually, and I'm embarrassed to say faked my way through those interviews, because during the interviews they're like, "Well, what would you build?" And since I was an avid user of both products, I could really richly say, "Here's the product feedback I have. Here are the new products you should build. Here's my feedback on things that we should be doing differently."

(00:08:39):
And they said, "Congratulations." And they gave me the job. And embarrassingly I went to the first day of work and I said to Amy Clement, who was the VP of product at the time, and I said, "Okay, I literally have no idea what this product job is."

(00:08:54):
She showed me the ropes and she was so incredible. She actually showed me, she said, "All those ideas you had, all that energy you've had around building these things, we go do that. Let's go do it." And I said, "Well, how do you do that?" And she said, "Well, you write down what you want to build and you work with the engineers to do it." And I just remember thinking, "This is crazy. I have no idea what I'm doing."

(00:09:14):
It was such an incredible adventure though. Those first few years, I just learned so much about the craft of building, how to really think through product use cases, how to think through what customers wanted, not just the customer of one, myself, but really what true customers and customer cohorts wanted. And so it was really a time when I felt like I was really blossoming, but I didn't come in with mastery. I came with a curiosity and I think that's what made me a great product manager was that I didn't have a set way of doing things. There wasn't some playbook I was trying to play. There wasn't some framework, but instead I was willing to learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
So one takeaway might be from this, the phrase, fake it till you make it. Any thoughts on just how to... I imagine many people right now are like, "Oh, I'm trying to get a job as a pm. How do I do this? That sounds great. I'm going to pass this interview, figure out the job after I joined."

Deb Liu (00:10:02):
Coming in with humbleness was really important, but during the interview process, actually, I didn't realize this, but they asked me questions as if I was a product manager, as if I knew what I was doing. I think when you have passion around a product or passion around a company or around a business model or around something, it shows. And so it's not necessarily faking the enthusiasm or faking the idea that you want to work there, but you don't have to know how to write this spec or PRD or briefings or anything like that. You don't know how to do customer research or do data analytics or read reports, but instead show your passion around the product itself, around the use case, around the customer.

(00:10:41):
Show who you are and why you care. I think sometimes people just say, "I want a product job." But you have to be able to fall in love with the problem. You have to fall in love, not with the product, but I said the problem, right? The use case. What problem are you trying to solve? And if you can do that, you can be a great product manager even without a lot of experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):
That's an awesome piece of advice. So just lean into the passion. First of all, part of it is you have to be excited about the thing you're trying to work on or thinking about the company you're thinking about joining. Sounds like that's a prerequisite here. We have a podcast episode with Uri Levine who has a whole book called Fall in Love with the Problem, which is all about that same idea actually for startup founders.

Deb Liu (00:11:20):
I'll have to read it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:20):
Yeah, he always wears a shirt, fall in love with the problem, not the solution.

Deb Liu (00:11:23):
Yes, is absolutely the most important skill for a product leader.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:27):
Something else I've heard you talk about in terms of something that contributed to your success is being okay with failure and just bouncing back quickly versus avoiding failure. Is that something that you can come back to a lot?

Deb Liu (00:11:40):
Well, here's what I noticed about everybody. I've coached a ton of people in my life. I have managed big teens and the people who are most successful are not the people who had no failures, who were lived charm lives, head up into the right careers and got promoted every cycle. The people who were most successful were the ones who actually through adversity, learned to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones. They were the ones who got hard feedback and then came back stronger because now they learned what to do differently.

(00:12:09):
They were the ones who products failed, but they said, "You know what? I'm going to turn this failure into success. I'm going to take those lessons and make this company stronger." When you live a charmed product life, you always work on everything that's easy. You don't actually... Trees are strong because they bend in the wind, because they're tested, because it's cold, because it's windy, because there's conditions.

(00:12:31):
And that's how a tree goes grow strong and tall over many generations. And I think sometimes we think, "Oh yeah, I wish I lived a charm life." And that is not what we want. You want to have enough adversity that you learn to overcome so that you can build stronger over time and build resilience in your career.

(00:12:50):
I've seen that so much, which is the best product leaders I ever worked with are the ones that have the toughest stories, that had the hardest feedback, but also the ones who were able to bounce back quickly and make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):
We have a segment on this podcast called Failure Corner where people share a failure they went through kind of along the same lines and something we learned from that experience. Is there an example of that from your career where a failure made you stronger?

Deb Liu (00:13:13):
Yeah. I remember there was a job that I really wanted at Facebook and I'd been there for a long time. I had been leading different teams. I was a VP of product and then GM. There was one job that I never got to do, so I got to do all the jobs I wanted and Mark gave it to someone else. I told him at the time when he gave it to the first person who was amazing at it, I said, "If this job were open, I'd like to be considered for it."

(00:13:37):
The job opened up later, gave it to someone else. And I said to Mark, again, "I really wanted that job." And he said, "Not only will I not give you that job, you'll never have that job at this company."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):
What?

Deb Liu (00:13:51):
He didn't say it harshly. But he was giving me feedback about something which he did not see me in that role, in a role that I really wanted. And I had to decide each time like, "What do I do with this information?" This is my dream job. Actually, I decided I was going to turn the job I had and the job I wanted, and that's a choice. I could have said, you know what? I can't have that job. I could go do something else, but I didn't. I took the job I had with the team I had and I turned it into this thing that was going to be something we wanted.

(00:14:20):
And so I think sometimes it's not... I think that that experience was a very humbling experience because to be told no and then to say that this will never happen was really hard. But at the same time it was a reminder that you're not right for every job even if you think you are. And that you can take the raw materials of what you have and turn it into what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):
Are you able to share what those jobs were that you wanted to get that you never got?

Deb Liu (00:14:44):
I never actually shared it publicly, but it's something which I had always had a role where I did new things for the company and there was a role where it was running something which more of an existing business, but I had always been kind of the innovator, the new stuff person. I had taken over so many new things. And so maybe that wasn't the right thing at the right time for me, but it was something that was really incredible and a turning point for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Great segue to an area I wanted to spend some time on which is building zero to one stuff within a larger company. So from what I can tell you built 2 billion businesses within a large company, Facebook marketplace, and then the ads platform within Facebook and maybe more. I don't know, the payments stuff, the games. I don't know. Maybe there's billions of dollars there I don't even know about. And this is very rare and very hard, and it's something we talk a little bit on this podcast, just the skills to build something new.

(00:15:38):
I know with marketplace it was not something people believed in for a long time. It took a lot of work to convince people to actually give it a shot. So I guess the question here is just what have you found are key tactics to start something new and allow it to continue to exist and get to a place where people start to believe it? What has worked for you?

Deb Liu (00:15:57):
So first, I didn't build the ads platform. I actually built the first direct response ad product company ever had. But we'll talk about how that led to why direct response is a vast majority of the ads revenue for the company. But one thing that it was really interesting is that I really saw my opportunity in Facebook to be somebody that zigged when other people zagged. There were amazing people who did a lot of the really core products working on feed, photos, videos.

(00:16:25):
I came in actually on the payments team and we worked on payments and eventually built games, which was the first billion dollar business. It was very successful. We worked with the likes of all the game companies that were on the Canvas games platform. And it was just an incredible opportunity to start from scratch and built something really cool. We built Facebook credits, which eventually became the Facebook payment system.

(00:16:47):
And then from there on I built the first direct response ads product. And again, leveraging the skills that we had, we had a lot of relationships with game companies because of my time and payments. And so we just said, "Hey look, what ad product do you want?" And they said, "Actually, your biggest challenge is the shift to mobile. Build us a mobile acquisition engine." And we said, "That's doable."

(00:17:09):
At the time the company was very brand oriented. Most of the ads... Actually almost all the ads on the platform were brand and we were not even on the ads team. So we actually worked on this team called the platform team. We said, "Okay, we'll build an ads product for the Facebook feed, the new mobile Facebook feed." And suddenly it became a billion dollar business within about 18 months, which was such an incredible journey.

(00:17:30):
We worked on the mobile advertising platform, so basically the mobile ads network. That was a great experience. And so each time I worked on something, it was just... The thing that you have to remember is the failure rate for something like this is very high. You start something and the amount of iteration... People think, "Oh yeah, it's easy." You start something and it's linear because you have all the resources of this company behind you. But actually everything in the company is like, "Let's do the most important thing."

(00:17:58):
These are seeds and we'll just let them... And so if you do that, you have to know that you don't get a lot of resources, you get a lot of attention. And I appreciated that because I think I work best when people aren't... There is not a lot of scrutiny. I think sometimes large companies, they say, "Well this innovation team," and then they check in on them way too much. They're like, "Week to week progress, where are you going? What's your strategy?" But so much as you know of building something new is the iteration process. It's the failing a lot.

(00:18:27):
We actually tested five or six versions of the ads product before we got it to take off and it took months, and then we were on the verge of death multiple times. In fact, I actually went back to run the payments team while I was working on that product because the team we had gathered still want to continue working on it, but I needed a second job back on the payments team because they asked me, "We don't think this thing is going to work. You should go run your old team again." And I thought, "Well, I will do both."

(00:18:52):
And so I did both for a while until it really took off. The thing that I think a lot of large companies don't realize is that you can love something to death. And so with every new product, I'd rather do it out of the limelight, do it with the minimal resources and have the freedom to fail because success and failure really is... In startups, failing fast is really important or succeeding fast.

(00:19:18):
It's the long slog that makes it really hard. In a company, you end up getting cut if you're the long slog product. And so being able to just say, "You know what? We're pruning this. We're doing the next thing, the next thing." And then having the time to iterate and grow is really critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
So as a leader trying to do this and create space for this, is there something you've learned about how to allow for, "Don't over scrutinize us, don't look at us too carefully. We don't want to be in the limelight. Don't put too many resources on this yet." Is it just like, "Hey, Mark. Here's what I think." I imagine it's not as easy as that. There's a lot of influence and that kind of work. Is there any tactics that you could share to create this sort of environment?

Deb Liu (00:19:59):
I think the most important part of the environment is really patience. And again, this is a portfolio strategy and I tell every PM who... I used to do a new hire PM class and I say, "Look, a lot of you are going to go into the core product and your job is to grow X by 3 to 5% every six months. Growing engagement or growing sessions or maybe growing video views or whatever your metric is, you're trying to grow something 5% and then you exceed expectations."

(00:20:27):
And I said, "And then a bunch of you are like, 'I want to do something new. I want to build something from scratch.'" And I said, "By the way, a very, very successful company for a new set of products has a 50% hit rate. So half of you are going to come back in a year and have a different job because that did not work out. Do you have the resilience to do that?" And I think somebody, you enter a large company... By the way, you can have an amazing career building core products because that is an incredible journey within... Because you learn so much about the mechanics of what that takes.

(00:20:59):
And yet at the same time, I found a lot of energy from doing something that someone hasn't done before. And so I really enjoyed the, "Hey, this thing could fail. Let's pivot. Let's try to figure out. Let's prune this. Let's try that." And not everything I did there succeeded, but a lot of the things that are the lasting products are once that gotten really big. And so for me it was a greater reward and it made a journey so much more interesting.

(00:21:24):
But for others, I think work on the core product, learn the skills. It is absolutely respectable as well. But if you choose to be the person who works on innovation new products, expect in a year, you might literally have nothing to show for it, but the lessons that you learned. And I think those lessons are really precious and we often underestimate that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):
Along those lines, do you think it's a good career move to do a zero to one thing within a bigger company? Or is it often a bad idea? Do you have any advice there for folks?

Deb Liu (00:21:52):
It depends. It depends on your personality in the company. So the one thing I realized about my role was that I did a lot of... I had five different careers at the company over 11 years. And so most people don't realize that when you work on new things, you're constantly adding to your portfolio, subtracting from it, growing things, pruning them. And so you could just work on so many cool things except everything has similar... It's like it rhymes, but it's not exactly the same.

(00:22:19):
So you learn the lessons of how to get things done, how to get resource, how to get support when the product is not working, how to not get prunes in the next culling. And those are really, really important skills. But I think for people who are just starting out of the career, it is a very high risk thing to do. So if you're very early in the career, I encourage people just learn the core skills first. You can learn the core skills when there's a lot of stability. This product is growing X percent, like 5%, and you're going to grow at 10. That's amazing.

(00:22:47):
That is because you are there, you're going to change your trajectory of the product, or this thing has a hundred thousand users, you're going to get it to 200,000. Those are the kinds of things that are going to be successful for you and you can put on your resume. But I think it reaches a point in your career where you have to decide, when am I going to take the big swing? Because the big swings are the things that you write your career stories about. They're not just, I moved this metric X, but I changed your trajectory in this way.

(00:23:17):
And so the big swings though have a lot of failures along the way. And so you have to understand you're making trade-offs in that. I encourage everybody to take some time, two, three years in their career when they're ready for the big swing, where if it doesn't work... If it works, you run the team, you run this amazing product. It doesn't work, you can always go back and go back to the core products.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:39):
It's interesting how your strategy here is very similar to a product portfolio strategy where as a team should have a few big bets and then a lot of incremental stuff. And it reminds me about this awesome post called You Are in Control of Your Career. And the argument in your post is you should PM your career the way you PM your product. So there's a lot of synergy here. So maybe just diving into this post and advice around this, how should someone be PMing their career, the way they PM a product? What's your take there?

Deb Liu (00:24:05):
By the way, for your PM audience, I want to say this, which is a lot of the greatest PMs are the worst PMs of their careers. They love products. They love the crafts. They love the customer research, the data. They have plans, they have timelines. And then when it comes to career, they have none of those things. They just drift from job to job. "Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what's in there? What are your milestones? What are the skills? What are the features that you want to have of your career? How are you going to get there? What does success look like?

(00:24:41):
You actually have metrics for your product, and yet you don't have metrics for your career. I coach a lot of people and when I coach them, I ask them, "Well, where do you want to see yourself in five years? Where do you want to go?" And half the people have no idea. I think that's really tragic because when you PM your career, it's about intentionality. But I'll tell you the story of my career and how I was the accidental PM and then eventually... I told you how I accidentally fell into PM, but also fell into so many of the things that happened in my PM career.

(00:25:10):
And if I had to go back, I would think much more deeply about what I want to accomplish. So I ended up at PayPal working for a guy named Dave Lee who reported to Amy Clement, and then he left. And so she offered me his role. I had only managed people for, I don't know, 15 seconds. I was two years out of business school and I was definitely not qualified to do his job. He was the director of product. I wasn't even a director and I was running the team for eBay.

(00:25:34):
So basically the PayPal part of eBay, which was basically half the company's revenues and profits. Totally unqualified. I ended up in this job and I do a good job. I ended up doing it for several years. I built up the team and we have a great relationship with eBay. Our team was very close and we were able to actually build something really lasting that worked really well. And then I had a baby. And so this happens in a lot of women's careers. I was turning 30, I had my son, and I had to leave for six months.

(00:26:08):
So I handed my product to my successor, Mike Woo and he ended up taking over. He did such a good job while I was gone, I didn't want to displace him when I got back. And so I thought, "Well, I'll go and look for another role." I couldn't really find a product role I liked, I mean, because there weren't that many product director roles. And so I ended up in corporate strategy. So I worked for the amazing Rajiv who was CEO at the time. He since passed and I wrote his speeches, worked on strategies, I worked on digital goods and charity, and ended up building that into a vertical for the company. So charity, social commerce and digital goods.

(00:26:40):
And I thought, "Okay, this is an interesting job." So I create the job, have a couple product managers, wasn't really sure where this was going, and then one day I was like, "You know what? I'm not feeling this. I have a child at home." I had gotten into what Cheryl Sandberg calls that kind of between kids situation where I was bored of my job.

(00:26:59):
I was working one of the VPs I worked with and I resigned. I said, "I'm leaving tech, just I'm going to stay home and maybe start something small." He convinced me to hold off and he said, I'll find you a job. He calls me a week later and he said, "Found you a job with Stephanie Tilenius leading the buyer experience at eBay product." And I said, "Oh, that sounds interesting." So I said, "Sure, as you notice, I do not have a plan. I'm just drifting. I'm so fortunate that I had amazing mentors who gave me opportunities, but end up working for Greg Fant and Stephanie Tilenius at eBay for two years.

(00:27:34):
I led the buyer experience. We did some really good work there. And then went on maternity leave again. And I get a call from a friend, my old engineering manager from PayPal, "Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? You can't come into product. You need a CS degree for that, but we have a product marketing job open." I was like, "Sounds good." Drop into Facebook. And so again, no idea what I'm doing back in product marketing. So I spent a few years doing that. Eventually was invited into product and so on and so forth.

(00:28:02):
And each job that came along was organic, but also kind of accidental. I see that happen in a lot of careers, which is my story when you look back, looks great. It looks like it all worked out, but I had almost zero intentionality in any of these. And I think that had I had more agency and I thought about what I wanted, I could actually measure is this the thing that would get me further or not?

(00:28:24):
I ended up extremely lucky, but not everybody does. And so I think having a plan allows you to compare every decision. It's not like when you're offered an admission to college, we're looking at three different offers maybe with financial aid or not, and you can make a decision, "Oh, they're offering me this department, but I can't get into this department." This is how far it is from home. But jobs and roles or nothing like that. Someone calls you one day, "Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? I'm actually on maternity leave." And he's like, "Just come talk to me." I'm like, "Why not."

(00:29:00):
And you end up dropping into different parts of your life and I think sometimes by saying, "Here's where I want to go and here's how I want to get there," you can have such a better career. And so I do encourage everybody to do this and to think about what does success look like in five years and how far am I from that and am I heading in the right direction?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:20):
What's interesting is I also had a similar path to you where I had zero plan or intention or goal and also just follow things and things worked out. I wonder how often that happens and I wonder if this idea of having intention and planning a roadmap is something you do if things aren't working out because maybe there's some good to not overthinking it and just following pull. I don't know.

Deb Liu (00:29:45):
Well, I think the problem is this with you and me, Lenny, is that hindsight bias is a problem. We made it because we weren't intentional in a lot of ways, but for how many people, is that true? For how many people who aren't... You don't have a plan and you get there. I always tell people, if you are sure what your destination is, that's definitely where you're going to end up. But if you actually aim in the right direction, you can shape your learnings, you can shape your roles you take, you can shape your skills towards the place that you want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:16):
When you talk about getting this offer from Facebook, usually those are like you have three days to decide.

Deb Liu (00:30:21):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):
And it feels like that's when the things you've done ahead of time of here's what I want would be most helpful.

Deb Liu (00:30:29):
Also, I think the thing about job opportunities in particular is they tend to come serially. It's only you presented these offers. It's like one role is so different from another and they often don't happen at the same time. They might say, "Well, you have to decide in two weeks." And then you say, "Well, there's this other company I'm talking to and you get a lot of pressure to say yes to this versus this."

(00:30:49):
And to really having a measuring stick is this getting me closer or further away from where I go? Can allow you to actually take serial decision making to a place where you're measuring against a long-term goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:01):
I did a meditation retreat once and when you're meditating, there's this kind of guidance of don't try too hard, don't push yourself to go into a direction, "Oh, I'm not doing a good job. I need to get to this enlightened state." And instead their advice is just push your cart in a direction and think about that's the direction you want head, but you don't need to grasp on to here's where I need to land, here's where I need to go. And I wonder if just having a thought of here's where I want my career to go. I want to be on boards in the future. I want to start a company in the future. I want to become a designer in the future. At least start there maybe just like a direction that you're heading.

Deb Liu (00:31:40):
Yeah. There's a woman who I worked with in product and now she's the founder, very successful founder, and she said to me, "I want to join the board of this Fortune 100 company." She told me the company, and I said, "Okay, that's a lot." So she said, "How can I get there?" And I said, "First, it's probably going to take you 10 years because look at who's on the board. I happen to know a couple people on the board." And I said, "Why don't I introduce you to one of them? And they can tell you how to get there.

(00:32:04):
But the point is she knew where she wanted to go and she said, "I'm willing to take it first step today." And I said, "First, you've never been on a board. You were very successful, but this is not... There's so many steps before you get there. It's like before you go to Harvard, you have to graduate from elementary school to middle school. You have to take the SAT, you have to apply. I said, "Let's start from the first step and let's break this problem down."

(00:32:29):
But I love that she knew where she wanted to go and she's like, "Even if I don't make it there, I'll be happier having made this journey." And I love that for her. And I think she's still earlier in her career, she has so much time ahead of her, but it's really incredible to see her kind of on this path and to know that that's her dream, and that I can help her a little bit along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
It also relates very much to your idea of thinking of your career like a PM thinks about their product where one of the tactics is to imagine the ideal scenario and work backwards from that versus incrementally what's the next thing? What's the next thing? So in this case, she was thinking, "Here's where I want to head. Okay, what's the next thing to get to that direction?" I love that.

(00:33:07):

(00:33:53):
Okay, going a slightly different direction, I'd say the post that you've written that has most resonated with me was about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert, and that basically have to learn to be an extrovert as an introvert because in business extroverts are most valued. Can you just talk about of your insight, what you've seen around this and how and your advice to introverts like me about how to be successful in business, what you need to change?

Deb Liu (00:34:22):
Well, first, I love the book, Quiet by Susan Cain. She talks about the power of introverts. Unfortunately, the world doesn't see the way the world the way she does. I wrote this post. It was the secret bias no one talks about, which is the workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. And I tell the story of somebody on my team who's just an amazing product manager, and yet every time she came up for promotion or calibration, people were like, "Oh, what does she do?" And it was because she was not good at broadcasting or explaining what she does.

(00:34:54):
I would take her to executive meetings and she was really bad at answering questions or talking. And so we would prep and prep and prep. I just knew her skills and I could see her every day moving the product forward. But for some reason people... Because your peers also have influence over people's ratings and their promotions, and I was constantly just trying to figure out how to get them to see her brilliance. I asked her once, I said, "I noticed that you never answer questions when we do these presentations." She's like, "Yeah, because I'm a processor. And by the time I process, I feel like the conversation has moved on."

(00:35:28):
And so I really feel like the world, it's not built for somebody like her who's a brilliant product leader, but people couldn't see it. And I realized that so much of what products and just general leadership is, is not just doing the work, but actually... It's not just having the product, it's having great product marketing to go with it. Let's call it that. Okay, so I've been in product and I've been product marketing. You make a light bulb, but you're selling light.

(00:35:53):
I really think about how that she was making amazing number of light bulbs. She was lighting up all the houses, but she was not marketing the light. And I think that was the thing that was really missing. Is that fair? Absolutely not. There are a lot of people who are born introverted. Is it fair that a product manager who isn't introverted, isn't extroverted is struggling with that? No, but that's the world we live in. And so it's one of those things where you get to choose what you do.

# 10 growth tactics that never work | Elena Verna (Amplitude, Miro, Dropbox, SurveyMonkey)

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
Growth is a fairly new field. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks, like what is the sure things to get growth. In the age of social media everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks. Oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
We're going to start with growth tactics that never work. If you see these items on your roadmap, you should probably not do them. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:00:26):
We live in tech. There's always lots of startups and startups obviously looking to grow. There is a huge misconception in the field that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team. To figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it, it's not something that you can outsource to somebody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
Powerful words. I'm loving this list already.

Elena Verna (00:00:45):
Number two, this was my favorite and it might be a little spicy. Never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially of UK marketing site produce good performance results. New CMO comes in designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste, and oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up and it never materializes into anything meaningful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
A lot of contrary intakes here, I love this.

Elena Verna (00:01:14):
Number three, if every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment that's a problem. It's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):
Today my guest is Elena Verna, my first ever third time repeat guest. Elena is the smartest person that I know on B2B Growth. She's also hilarious. She's led growth at companies like Miro Amplitude, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey. She's advised dozens of companies on growth including Superhuman, MongoDB, Netlify, Similarweb, Sanity, Maze, so many more. In our conversation, Elena shares 10 growth strategies and tactics that never work yet that she keeps seeing people and companies invest lots of resources into. She also covers her three favorite growth frameworks that help you wrap your head around how to think about growth, and she also does a short dive into the non-traditional career paths that we both went down.

(00:04:40):
Elena, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast, our first ever third-time repeat guest. What an honor Dancing if you're not watching on video. Thank you for being here. I was actually just looking at our first episode, which we recorded almost over two years ago, September of 2022, and someone just today left a comment. People are still finding and watching it, and this comment encapsulates why I love having you on this podcast. This person said, "Wow, every word from Elena encapsulates years of knowledge. This is one to digest, slowly go back to and put on repeat. Thanks for sharing your experience with the world"

Elena Verna (00:05:23):
Thank you for having me. And my north star metric is insights per minute. That's what I try to use whenever I have any live meetings with people so it squarely fits within what I'm optimizing for. That's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):
That needs to be my KPI on this podcast, "Insights per minute."

Elena Verna (00:05:40):
I think you have it. I think your insights per minute is pretty high.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:44):
That is. I do shoot for that, although I have learned you also needed to feel good and feel their story. There's an interesting combo stuff. You can't just be insight, insight, insight.

Elena Verna (00:05:54):
It's all about how you present them too. Storytelling is a big portion of it actually to stick.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):
Already insight. That's an insight right there. There's two areas that I want to spend time on with you, and these are areas I know you've been thinking a lot about. One is growth tactics that never work, that people keep spending time on and waste their time on. And I know you have a nice list of things you've seen that just don't work that people keep trying. And then two is growth frameworks, your favorite growth frameworks to help people wrap their mind around how to think about growth and grow their product. We're going to start with growth tactics that never works. Maybe just frame what we're going to talk about, talk about what this list and collection of tactics that we're going to talk about is.

Elena Verna (00:06:36):
Growth is a fairly new field compared to marketing or product management or engineering. There's a lot of people that are now accumulated that have 10 years or so experience, but there's also a lot of newcomers and because there's ratio of actually newcomers, it's much higher than those people that have five, 10 years of experience of doing growth. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks. What is the sure things to get growth? What is the sure thing to get that metric up? How can I contribute to success with the company the fastest way possible? All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever.

(00:07:35):
There's just a lot of failure happening in growth teams. Actually, I think growth teams are becoming one of those departments that has a higher head of growth firing rate than even CMOs because people are coming in, there's a bunch of expectations, "Hey, you're ahead of growth or you are a growth pm or you're a growth marketer, you're supposed to drive growth." And when that growth does not happen, here comes the axe and people off they go and the recycle and cycle starts all over in order to populate those positions. I think that there's just a lot of misinformation I would say probably out there in terms of what growth actually is and how it should be done in the companies. And today I just want to cover some of the biggest ones that I see as a patterns as I'm advising companies, as I'm operating in companies because it's just so blatant yet there's very few pieces of information on this for people to learn from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):
Amazing. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:08:34):
Number one, I have to start with hiring. There's lots of positions open all the time. There's so many from head of growth to growth PM there's a lot of rotation, as I said that is happening in the field. Very few growth people actually stay in the job for over a year or two years. There's a lot of constant churn and constant rehiring. And when you doing hiring, there's a lot of mistakes that are actually happening in hiring that I just want to start off on the list. It's not a roadmap item, but oh my gosh, there's just so much fault that is happening here. And I did write about it on your blog of hiring for growth. There's a little bit of a reference to that and one of the biggest latent issues that I see is hiring too soon for growth.

(00:09:17):
We live in tech, there's always lots of startups. Startups are obviously looking to grow and there is a huge misconception in the shield that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team, absolutely not true. In order to get the growth going in the company, a founder and the founding team have to figure out how to make it grow to the first, let's say a million, 5 million, 10 million in ARR. Some of the companies don't even create growth teams until they're a hundred, 200 million in ARR because to figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it's not something that you can outsource to somebody. It's not somebody that with a shiny resume can come over and all of a sudden wave a magic wand and all of a sudden you have viral campaigns and a bunch of signups coming through and everybody's paying and everybody's retaining.

(00:10:09):
That just doesn't happen. I see that mistake happening a lot. I really believe that the founder led growth is not being popularized enough that you do not need growth teams until you actually can start running experiments on your user base, which means that you have volume of users that you can learn from and optimize and innovate on, and that first wave of growth has to be founder led.

(00:10:35):
And there's two specific reasons that I incur on, which is before you have growth team, before you would think about growth team first you need to have solid PMF, product market fit, means that you have a solution to a problem and you have customers not only coming in and solving that problem with your solution, but they're also retaining and staying with you. There is a good retention. You can use channel score of how many people would say that they cannot live without your product as well, but there's some sort of PMF. And then number two, you have data growth cannot function without data. If you have 10 users or 10 customers, that's not data, that's a G-sheet with your customers and you don't need a growth team for that. Until you have data that you can actually do an analysis and you can create hypotheses on and you can start applying experimentation, don't even think about growth team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):
Just to summarize a few of the things you just said, just for folks, you basically have seen startups look for a head of growth to join and solve their growth problem and your insight there is just almost always that is not going to be the solution to your problem until you have strong retention already, have a really high score on the channel score if don't have a ton of data yet and party advice is just the founder should continue to do this for as long as possible. A million ARR is one milestone a lot of people recommend. To your point, a lot of companies wait lot longer.

Elena Verna (00:12:06):
Yes. And honestly, the longer you wait, the better it is because that way your entire company will be trained to be responsible for growth as opposed to putting this one island with a growth team and saying, "They're going to be growing," and what is the rest of the company doing? Honestly, the longer you wait, the better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
As you talk about this, sales is a part of what you described here, like hiring your first sales person. And I guess how do you think about your first head of growth versus salesperson? Is there anything advice there is? Like for B2B SaaS, you probably don't hire head of growth for even longer, you hire sales first or what's your advice?

Elena Verna (00:12:42):
It depends on how you're actually going to collect the monies. If your money collection is going to happen through sales team primarily, then you absolutely should be hiring sales way before growth. In fact, in the sales led companies, growth teams are not necessarily needed even that much. You might have a growth marketing team, which is really a demand gen team that is rebranded for growth marketing so they can charge you 20 to 30% more in their salaries, but at the end of the day, sales is doing your monetization. They are doing your activation, they are doing your retention and success efforts. For sales like companies, yeah, higher sales, absolutely. Unless you're starting to do self-serve revenue.

(00:13:23):
You're trying to have product sell itself through potentially freemium acquisition, trial acquisition or you actually having product led activation, monetization, that's when you would need a growth person. If you're starting with self-serve monetization, growth hire should be frankly first before sales. Your sales are going to be more opportunistic in nature versus if you sales led company, go ahead, hire sales, wait for growth until you are ready to overlay product-led growth on top of your sales motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
That's an excellent clarification. Basically what I'm hearing, the advice is hire your ahead of growth only when you have clear product market fit and you're a product-led company and beyond a millionaire ARR ideally something like that.

Elena Verna (00:14:11):
Right. And I won't say you're product-led company. You are relying on product-led motion to resolve a lot of the growth levers within you because you don't have to be fully product-led company. But if product, let's say acquires people, let's say with the SEO or SEM, and then its product is meant to activate them and then sales closes them, sales would be obviously important as well, but growth would have to come in a little bit sooner as well. If you have any product-led components where product is responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization or retention, that's where growth comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):
We talked deeply about that specific topic in our first conversation, just for folks, want to go deeper there. There's lot there.

Elena Verna (00:14:53):
I need to bring it back. This is keeps happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
I love that.

Elena Verna (00:14:55):
I need to repeat it. You need to repeat it three times right before it sticks to people. Hopefully this is the third time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I'm only saying that because people may be wanting more of what you're describing and I will point them to our first episode, which gives deep on that one topic.

Elena Verna (00:15:09):
Amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:10):
Excellent. Anything else before we move on to number two?

Elena Verna (00:15:13):
No, let's move on to number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Let's do it.

Elena Verna (00:15:16):
Number two, this is on the other side on the matured company where I see a trend over and over, and it's becoming even more prominent right now of when companies growth slows down, which inevitably happens for a lot of businesses, it happens for a variety of reasons. We're not going to go into the reasons as to why growth can be slowing down and then they hire a shiny growth head to fix the problem, to basically saying, "Our business is slowing down. We are on the decline. We're going to bring this person, or we're going to put this team together and our growth is going to accelerate." That just does not happen. If you have the overall business slowing down, your head of growth is destined to fail because the reason business is slowing down is much deeper than not having a growth team.

(00:16:03):
Growth team can optimize, growth can maybe lift it by 10, 15%. Maybe that's enough for you. Even that is on the upper end of what growth team will be able to do if there is a slow-down trajectory. But what's important is that if you have core product and core marketing issues, growth team will not be able to fix them for you. You're going to have to address the big elephant in the room as to why business is slowing down in the first place as opposed to just plopping a growth team on the issue and expecting them to do miracles while the rest of the business continues chugging on the same trajectory that caused the slowdown in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
Wow, I've never heard this point before and it's such an important one and it's very related to your first point. Growth isn't going to build a product people want, they will help you grow it

Elena Verna (00:16:53):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
If your business is slowing, your product market fit basically might be disappearing and growth isn't solving that problem.

Elena Verna (00:16:59):
Disappearing, it may be degrading, it may be being eaten by a competitor because there's somebody that is stomping on your territory. The point is growth can amplify great product market fit and growth can help you grow faster once you are already growing. But if you are slowing down and you have issues with either your go-to-market strategy or your core product strategy with your core product market fit, growth is going to be absolutely helpless to do anything. And it's honestly, it's a huge waste of money because at those size of the companies, you would make fairly large growth teams in order to tackle every single product flow and interface that is already out there and invented.

(00:17:45):
It's a huge expense. ROI on it, maybe at least one to one. What you put into it, you might get that much out of it, but it's not going to be enough to create a J curve of the reacceleration by just relying on growth team. I think it's just like this is where the name growth team plays against it because, "We're looking for growth. Do you have a growth team?" No. I don't have a better idea by the way how to name it, but this is where I think it's misunderstood that there's the silver bullet of a perfect head of growth, perfect growth team that can reverse the trajectory of the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):
Then for folks that are thinking about, "Wow, maybe I should be hiring head of growth," when should you hire head of growth? When you're an established company,

Elena Verna (00:18:33):
If you are declining in your revenue growth or whatever other metric that you're looking at, your weekly active users or whatnot, see at least that you're able to plateau it so you can stop the decline. There is already a visible trajectory that your core product and your core marketing teams are able to at least reverse the degradation of the metrics. Ideally, you would even start to see some immediate signs of life that there is potential in the business, in the pockets, and then you can put growth into it to really blow it up to the full extent. But if you are on a decline, just don't do it because there's going to be very disappointing results in the year or so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:18):
Awesome. Great one, let's move on. Number three.

Elena Verna (00:19:23):
Number three, this is my favorite, and it might be a little spicy because if there's any marketers listening out here, but doing rebrand more specifically, homepage redesign to drive growth. This is what hurts me so much and I've lived through so many of these and never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially a UK marketing site, produce good performance results. Now, there's many reasons as to why you might want to do a rebrand, why you might want to design your marketing site because you're trying to enter a new market, new category, your product has evolved and you need to do a full update. But those are almost like it's a logging indicator that something needs to change and you're changing it and then you know that you're going to have to optimize the hell out of it in order to actually bring it even to the previous performance results.

(00:20:22):
It's like a stepping stone back, but there is a much bigger room for upside that you can get to, but you are going to have to work to get to that upside. But yet so many companies, there's a story that happens all the time. I hire a new CMO, new CMO comes in, they're like, "What's inside my house here? My house is not designed to my liking. Let me repaint these walls. I want this shade of blue. Let me put the couches over here." And they start almost designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste. And oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up, our category penetration is going to go up, our education or awareness is going to go up.

(00:21:10):
And it never materializes into anything meaningful because again, if you're doing it as a step towards unlocking new global maxima, sure, I love that. Do it. Go after it. Know that you have a ton of work ahead of you in order to actually unlock that global maxima. But to ever promise a homepage redesign or marketing site redesign in order to drive more acquisition is a failed promise that is going to be led by lots of agency money spending, often a million dollars plus, lots of arguing about which shade of blue your brand color is going to be, and eight to 10 months at the minimum of development and very lackluster results afterwards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:58):
Oh man, I'm loving this list already. This is great. To your point, it may still be worth doing if you're coming into it eyes wide open, this isn't going to drive growth, but we're setting ourselves up for a future brand that's world-class and we know our current brand stinks and our homepage needs to be refreshed. If you're aware, it's not going to drive growth, it might be okay.

Elena Verna (00:22:19):
Every single time I've seen a marketing site at least rebrand, it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix. Just don't do it if you expect immediate results out of it, or at least educate the team on how long it's going to take to get to the point where you think that there's going to be upside away from your original brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):
I've experienced this not just with marketing sites, but most redesigns. Redesign of the product.

Elena Verna (00:22:53):
Product redesign. How much product and engineering work comes into just changing a logo in your product or changing colors? It's insane. With no results ever, there's no results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
And to your point, it's like, "We've spent six months redoing onboarding. Everything we've built builds on this new design and experience, we can't not launch it. Every team is working on this new world, we're just going to launch it and then we're going to claw back. We're going to figure out how to get it back." That's how it goes.

Elena Verna (00:23:26):
It's a new starting point and that starting point is going to be much lower than your current optimized experience that you have. Whether it's well optimized or not optimized, it doesn't matter. It's gone through some level of optimization versus rebrand is always a shot in the dark. It might be prettier, sure, but that doesn't mean it's going to perform well. Obviously never say never. Sometimes it might work, and if it worked for you, I am so glad. But that's an outlier and don't treat it as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:57):
And I was just going to say, I think everyone listening to this that is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this. We've really thought deeply about this and it might actually be really positive." In your experience, it sounds like you've seen it work occasionally, or is it just never?

Elena Verna (00:24:15):
The best I've ever seen is that it produced net neutral results and it produced us better ability to optimize towards something bigger. That's the best case scenario. So if you're working on it, my biggest advice is not to say you stop. Just understand that the goal here is not to drive at launch, in the seven-day readout after launch, some increased performance.

(00:24:38):
The goal here should be, we will launch, we will probably see a hit, model out and forecast for a hit, and then give yourself two to three months at the minimum, ideally more like six months, to really optimize it back to a good standing where it can potentially outperform. But you need to bake in that three to six months of work after the launch, which is what a lot of companies and teams forget to do because they just move on. Because it's like big initiative, big pop, and off we go to our next project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:08):
I love that we're only at number three. This is amazing. Let's do number four.

Elena Verna (00:25:13):
Okay. Number four is obsessing over your competition. Okay, so there's a little bit of a gotcha here. I tear down companies all the time. I have thousands of Gmail accounts that I sign up for any and every product. I go through their entire experience. I look at their monetization strategies. I look at their activation. I do it across direct competition of the company that I'm working with as well. I want to know what I'm playing against.

(00:25:45):
So knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important. Being inspired by some aspects of what your competition is doing in their experience is a wonderful place to originate an ideation or potentially try to implement into your product as well. But blatantly saying, "Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same. Why isn't our onboarding looks the same as this onboarding? This company is so successful."

(00:26:20):
That's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel. You don't even know if you're getting their actual experience or you use some tester cell or you're getting some personalized thing based on where you signed up from, who you said that you are. So you don't even know what actually the overall thing looks like most of the time and putting that into your product, it just leads to very subpar results. And there's a lot of drive, especially to have it as a shortcut. "Okay, we don't want to go through this ideation or user research. We don't want to do user interviews, but we don't want to do A/B testing. It works for them. It must work for us. Let's just go and do it." And it fails 95% of the time.

(00:27:08):
Now, there are certain pieces that I would rightly recommend. I already said inspiration. I use it for inspiration all the time. I'm like, "Okay, what's cool? What is everybody doing?" So because I want to just stay in the know on what other people are implementing and hopefully if it's in the control experience, it works and it worked better. I use web archives a ton for locked out pages too. I'm like, okay, how did it look last year? Why does their whole page look this way, or the pricing page? And I analyze that and I try to extrapolate some results.

(00:27:40):
I also think that there is a lot of patterns you start to notice as you start tearing down all of these companies. You're like, "Oh, these elements are always the same." That means all of these companies are arriving to these things and they seem to be winning elements. And you can take those elements and put them into your product, but you can never skip the ideation, the design, the user research, the customer interview, the experimentation step.

(00:28:04):
And you should always balance it with actually innovating yourself in your product. Because copying competition is like the fastest way to mediocrity because you'll never be a leader if you copied somebody else. Leader is by default is somebody that is able to separate themselves from the pack in something else. And if you are trying to just be, I don't know who is ever trying to be the mediocre middle of the pack, but maybe it's a good starting point, but never the end goal.

(00:28:37):
The only other thing that I'll say before I'll stop talking is benchmarks. Benchmarks are also very dangerous here to use because benchmarks are usually done on all of the competition, on all of the softwares out there. And the way people define numbers is so different from company to company. Even if you look as something as simple as signups. Okay, how many signups should you be on average getting? Or your conversion from prospecting visitor to a signup? Or from a signup to activated user? It's so depends on how do you define prospect visitor? Some companies define it as all traffic. Some define it as new traffic. Some of them define it on the new IP address, new persistent id. How Google analytics defines it. How Amplitude defines it.

(00:29:21):
So all of these definitions are so different. So taking also any benchmark that is derived from competition and saying, "This is where we should be," is also so dangerous because it might not even be applicable depending on how you define the metric. And one of the things that all of those benchmarking data fails is to actually look at specific definitions. And that's not to say that benchmarks are not extremely valuable data point in your decision making because it's an input that you should leverage to say what it could be possible. But to just blindly it and set it is just a sure way to fail any of your initiatives and efforts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
You're telling me that there's no shortcuts?

Elena Verna (00:30:10):
I wish there were. I mean, I've been doing this for over 15 years. If there were any shortcuts, I'd be all over them. There are patterns and there are frameworks, but there's no shortcuts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:20):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Okay, don't copy the competition. Use it for inspiration." It's a little hard to know exactly the line between those two. Is there an example that you can think of where you took really interesting inspiration from someone and it worked for a company you're working with? Or you copied someone and it's just like, "Oh, that failed. That was a bad idea."

Elena Verna (00:30:41):
I use competition to understand the general framework of how people collect some information or resolve certain steps. So, for example, a sharing model so many products like, "Hey, can you share this with somebody?" Well, you can go and spend so much time of figuring out how it should look. Or you can go to Slack, you can go to Figma, you can go to Nero, you can go to Notion. Like, okay, Google, how are they doing sharing model? You can look at all of that and say, "Okay, here's all of the common elements that all of them have. Here's the pieces that I think will apply to my product. Here's things that do not, and here's what I can derive from it."

(00:31:19):
I use it as an input into ideation, but I never use it as a destination for the result, if that makes sense. Because it's very helpful to not start from scratch. The empty start problem is real and competition is a wonderful way to not have that and to have input into it, but never to just say, "Oh, we can skip the design cycle off we go," or, "Just slap our colors on it. If it works for them, it's going to work for us." So I have extensive Nero boards with everybody's onboarding flows, with everybody's pricing pages, their sharing model, their invite colleagues models that I reference all the time.

(00:32:00):
But they've never been the exact thing that I would use for any company as opposed to say, "Hey, I think this is a great starting point for you. Here are the things that I think will work very well for your company and for your product and take these elements. The rest you need to go and do themselves, so at least that way there's a starting point."

(00:32:22):
And this is why I also started doing a lot more of my own, almost, prototypes, like skeletons of here's the elements that you should do in these flows. I have one for pricing page, I have one for homepage, but you need to put in your own [inaudible 00:32:36] into it, in order for it to actually work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):
What made me realize this back in the day was thinking at Airbnb, especially, thinking about people looking at our flow and being like, they've got it all figured out. We're just going to copy what they've done, so thoughtful and have tested everything. And knowing how that has not happened and how so much of this was guesswork and we hate so much of it. Just thinking about people trying to copy this thinking we know what we're doing. It's like, "What are you guys even thinking?"

Elena Verna (00:33:02):
Oh my God, I actually had that happen to me. At Dropbox not so long ago, somebody reached out and they're like, "Oh, I looked." It was like some page on activation flow and they're like, "Oh, I love this page. This is so cool. I love what you've done here. I'm going to go take it to my company." I'm like, "We haven't touched it in 10 years. This page is only visible for small cohort of people. Please don't do it. Please don't copy it. It performs like shit. I know it's out there, but it's not meant to be out there. Nobody thoughtfully put it out there." So that's definitely a huge failure point that you can run into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
Right, if it's like a fancy company, assume they're just so smart and diligent about every little pixel and decision.

Elena Verna (00:33:48):
If people only knew of how much craziness is happening in those big companies and how much chaos there is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
Oh man, that's a whole other podcast episode.

Elena Verna (00:33:59):
Whole other podcasts, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:00):
Okay, number five.

Elena Verna (00:34:02):
Okay, I have this one. It's a little bit Meta, but I see it happening all the time. We love to think that our problems are unique. I'm working in this company and we have this gross problem and we need to go and figure out the solution from the grounds up. Maybe this is a little bit related to the competition point, but I'm very sorry to break it to all of you, but your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that. Your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere in probably many, many places and you trying to re-engineer solution is time lost to market and has a huge opportunity cost.

(00:34:49):
So my biggest thing that I try to get people is don't think that you have unique problems. You don't. I know we love to. It'd be fun to have something unique to learn, but with so many startups, with so many people in our industry, in your industry, whichever industry that is, your problem has been solved by somebody. Or at least that there's a lot of failures on the problem that you should be learning from. And number one thing that whenever you have an initiative or whenever you have a metric that you need to go and move, to not start from scratch, ever. Do not start from scratch. It's the worst thing that you can do because you can waste so many cycles on trying to do something that probably has already been solved, which means how do you approach this as a result?

(00:35:41):
Well, you can look at competition and how they're solving the problem. That's one input, for sure. You should go find people that have solved this problem because there are people there and people love to talk about what they do. So take advantage of that human psychology and go find those people and just ask them, "How did you do it? What did you do? What happened?" Obviously, not all the time everybody's going to respond, but we have LinkedIn, we have X. Go out there, find the people that you think or ask around in your network of who you think might have similar solutions and just go talk to people. It would be incredible shortcut if you're talking about an actual hack that is a hack to get to an optimal solution.

(00:36:26):
And then the last thing that I would also say is that solving any one problem uniquely is extremely inefficient. We are evolving so fast in our market, you need to be able to patternize your solutions. Patternize, is that a word?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):
Let's make it a word.

Elena Verna (00:36:44):
Make patterns. Make patterns out of your solutions. So more you can stop looking at as a unique data point or unique problem and more as there is, I need to fit it into existing pattern or I need to figure out the framework on how to solve not only this problem but other problems. The faster you'll be able to get at least to like 60% of the solution there. And then you can do very authentic implementation of whatever you want to do. But to go from zero to 60 manually, as a one-off, we do not have time in the industry right now to do it, unless you want to be left behind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):
Bam. Powerful words. Is there an example that comes to mind of you doing this either the wrong way of just thinking this was unique and realizing I should have talked to people, or where you actually realized something was not unique?

Elena Verna (00:37:37):
I'll give you actually an example that I had when I was at Nero. At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community, and I was tasked to do it, and I've never done it before. So I was banging my head around against the wall and I'm like, "Okay, how do I do it? What software do we use? Where do we acquire users? What kind of content is going to go in there?"

(00:38:02):
So I was approaching it almost like a finding product market fit, and I will fail so much doing it. And I honestly only have a year to get to some sort of traction before this is going to get shut down because company is impatient, company is moving fast. So if this is going to be a failure point, it's either going to be taken away from me, which is fair, or we is going to close the door on it, which would be a huge failure both on my point and for company as a whole.

(00:38:29):
So I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities, and I remember talking to Caroline from Atlassian who has stood up community. I actually hired her as an advisor afterwards and she's like, "Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?" And I'm like, my mind was blown. I'm like, "I even considering all of these angles because I was just literally thinking about users only." And she's like, "Well, you shouldn't necessarily start with the user community. If you want some results out of it, go to agency or partner communities first." She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results at the end that I wouldn't even gotten to probably until six, eight months later, if I didn't talk to her.

(00:39:19):
So I think it has to come with a place of knowing that you don't know everything and humility to say, "Hey, I need help," and I might have a already fancy title. At that point, I was an interim CMO at Nero and I'm like, "I don't know how to do this." And it actually earns you a lot more credit than you think. And a lot of people are afraid to admit that they don't know how to solve a problem and that's why they start from scratch. But you need to really put your ego aside and get some help faster than trying to hit every single failure point along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:02):
And the thing that'll really hurt your ego is failing. And so the more you could do to avoid failing and being successful with this initiative by talking to people, doing research.
