## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I've always wanted to create a very tactical episode on how to do sales, especially with a focus on founder led sales.

Jen Abel (00:00:06):
A lot of early stage founders get tripped up as they're taking late stage sales advice. The founder is the product. You have studied. You have experienced something that most of the market hasn't even had a chance to maybe see or visualize yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
A billion SaaS tools emailing me constantly about their product. How do you get someone to even want to talk to you and be open to learning about what you're doing?

Jen Abel (00:00:25):
So if you can focus the messaging in a way that speaks to something that is a bit of shock value or is counterintuitive, you'll get them to continue reading. When a problem is truly being felt by the market, people will get on a call, people will respond.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
The next step I imagine is you're on the phone with them trying to convince them to actually care. What do you do there? How do you get them to engage further?

Jen Abel (00:00:45):
You need to be vulnerable. I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We have a lot to learn. Can we kind of gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side? Founder led sales is not about revenue on day one. It is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse, so that you can earn the right to sell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today my guest is Jen Abel. Jen is the co-founder of Jellyfish, where her and her team help early stage founders learn how to sell, do early customer discovery, and set up a repeatable sales motion. Prior to Jellyfish, Jen was an enterprise sales director at the Muse and a general assembly, and she's obsessed with helping founders in the zero to one stage of their journey. In our conversation, we get extremely tactical and in the weeds on how to actually do sales as a founder. We talk through each step of the sales process, and Jen shares what you should be doing and saying at every step. We go through how to find your first set of leads, how to reach out to them, what to say in your message, how to structure your first sales call, how to get through procurement, and how to get that final signature.

(00:01:55):
She shares actual words you should be using, and phrases and structures, and pitfalls that most people run into at each of these steps. I've never heard a podcast episode with this much advice that you can put into practice tomorrow, and I am very excited to hear how it goes for you.

(00:02:24):
Jen, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Jen Abel (00:02:27):
Thanks, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:28):
What I've always wanted to do is to create a very tactical episode on how to do sales, like how to actually have sales conversations, how to find leads, how to close deals. Especially with a focus on founder led sales, where founders are doing the early sales versus hiring salesperson. Which one, I know you're a huge advocate of and we'll talk about this. And two, you basically spent all your time working with founders and founding teams, helping them learn how to do sales, how to set up their go-to-market motions, how to scale teams, sales teams, how to hire sales people. So I'm very excited to have you here to create a very in the weeds, hands-on episode on how to do sales. How does that sound broadly?

Jen Abel (00:03:07):
That sounds awesome, and thank you so much for having me, Lenny. I mean, it's a true pleasure to be here with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:12):
It's my pleasure. Many people have recommended you come on this podcast. I'm excited we're doing this. Let me start with just this kind of question, our founder led sales. Maybe just briefly explain what that term means and then talk about why this is so important, why this is the way you recommend companies start doing sales?

Jen Abel (00:03:29):
Founder led sales is really that first milestone that a startup goes through on the commercial side, which is, how do I go out and get my first few customers? Some people might say zero to one, which is, how do I get my first million? Others might say, how do I go out and get my first 10 customers? It's all kind of in the same vein. And founder led sales is really, really, really important because in the very, very, very early days, when there is no brand equity, when there is no marketing engine running, when there is limited to no reference ability, the founder is the product, right? Because the product is still, could be abstract, could be an MVP or in it's really early formation. So the founder is the product. When people say, well, what does that even mean? It means that you are a subject matter expert on something highly specific.

(00:04:23):
You have studied, you have experienced something that most of the market hasn't even had a chance to maybe see or visualize yet. So you have this novel insight that you are building a business around. And it's that novel insight and the way you see the world that gets the market excited, in absence of a product. And that's actually happens even before you even show the product. So founder led sales is how do you bring the founders vision into the world and have the market, and understand what part of the market accepts it, and then what part of that vision are they accepting? So it's aligning the founders vision with the market reality.

(00:06:50):
And this is counter to what many founders hope is, I'm just going to hire a salesperson, they'll handle sales. I'll build the thing, I'll wait for them to find deals. And this is like a lot of people think this way. And founder led sales is the movement of just like, no, no, you should be doing the sales for a long time as a founder.

Jen Abel (00:07:06):
Absolutely. I mean, it is the competitive advantage. I don't think people realize how much of a competitive advantage the founder led sales motion is, for three specific reasons. One is that the founder is the visionary. No one's going to be able to speak to it like they can. No salesperson, really no non-founder. The second is that they are the highest order in the hierarchy of the startup. It's the founder. So the market is excited to talk to a founder because they usually know something that the market doesn't know. And they want to learn and maybe they want to experience something differently. So being able to speak to the person that's running the vision, speak to the person that's crafted the vision.

(00:07:50):
And then that third piece is that the founder can see something budding in a conversation that a salesperson won't be able to see. And it's those budding moments that's where all the gold lives. And I don't think a lot of founders realize that. Their day one market vision is never the same vision that takes them in a product market fit. And I say that all the time. It's these little budding moments where it's like I was able to get to that budding insight because I went deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper through these calls and these conversations, to fully refine how we want to go out and sell it. And only a founder is going to be able to see those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:26):
I love this because this connects really well with an episode I just did with the CMO of Wiz. And the founders went through this exactly. They had 10 to 15 conversations a day for weeks, and then they're like realizing people keep telling us they like it, but no one's buying, no one's excited enough to want to actually move forward. And that was only happening because the founders were on these calls.

Jen Abel (00:08:49):
Yeah, I mean, the other thing too is that it becomes a game of telephone. It's like, hey, this salesperson says that no cares about this. What do you think the first thing the founder's going to say is? It's the salesperson. So much easier to say that than, is it me? Is it my vision? So it also kind of brings the accountability closer to the pulse where decisions are made.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):
It's interesting how similar this is to product building, where there's this idea that a founder top down can tell the team what to build, and it's this very waterfall cycle. When in reality the idea of the product and feature is just like step one, and then there's actually building it, testing it, talking to customers about it, that actually turns that initial seed of an idea to the real thing that people will want.

Jen Abel (00:09:33):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:34):
Okay. So the catch 22, I don't know if that's the term here. The challenge is, okay, so great, founders should be doing sales. Most founders have never done sales. They just want to build product. They're mostly product people, design people. Sometimes there's founders that are salespeople. Rarely is that the case in my experience. So doing sales is very hard, not something that comes naturally to a lot of people. A lot of people are very afraid of it. So with that, let's get into how to actually get better at the sales process. I think a nice framework for how we can go through this is basically first let's talk about the sales cycle, the steps, the key steps of a sales cycle. And then we'll just go through each step and help people learn some tactics to get through each of those conversations.

Jen Abel (00:09:35):
Sounds great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):
Okay. Yeah. Cool. So what's the simplest way to think about the steps of a sales cycle?

Jen Abel (00:10:26):
The traditional sales stages that most CRMs are even set up as is you have your intro call. You have your second call, which sometimes could be the demo depending on the stage of market you're selling to. Then you have your third call, which is going to be more about walking through a proposal, a scope of work, maybe going deeper into the demo to contextualize it to everything you've learned. The fourth call is going to be getting their feedback and kind of co-authoring that scope of work even further. The fifth call is going to be around probably an introduction to procurement. And then selling into procurement in itself, it's its own little sales cycle, but we could talk about that in a sec. And then post-procurement, it's going to be obviously getting that signature and knowing who the actual signatory is. Sometimes it's not even the business unit, it's sometimes legal, CFO, procurement themselves. So just understanding who that is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):
Okay, great. So let's walk through each of these steps. So I love that each call has its traditional goal, demo, proposal, then co-authoring, and then procurement, and then post-procurement. I love how consistent everybody is.

Jen Abel (00:11:39):
Yeah, well, it's also, it's interesting because it's also predicated on their buying process as well. So if they're really used to buying, if they're very mature in their buying process, they actually might guide you to what the steps are. But most startups are turning non-consumers into consumers. So that's why this kind of fits well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
Got it. So there's this intra call step. So kind starting about where it begins. I think where a lot of people struggle most is getting anyone to even pay attention. You don't want to talk to them. A billion SaaS tools emailing me constantly about their product. So maybe we start there of just like how do you get someone to even want to talk to you and be open to learning about what you're doing?

Jen Abel (00:12:19):
Yeah. And this is why that founder led sales piece is so important. One is when it's coming from the founder, it's an entirely different weight. You're like, oh, interesting. This founder is reaching out to me. Okay, I'm going to seek to go a layer deeper, knowing who is sending me this note. The second piece is this is why that novel insight, that technical insight, that business model insight that you've uncovered needs to lead here. People are inspired by a new way of thinking, usually something counterintuitive, something that's really different. I really try and stay away from better, because that's really hard to define, and better means something different to everyone. So if you can focus the messaging in a way that speaks to something that has a bit of shock value, or is counterintuitive, you'll get them to continue reading. So first and foremost, I usually like to open it with, which is why is this relevant for me in my role?

(00:13:20):
Why are you reaching out to me? So first and foremost is relevancy. I think that matters even more so than personalization right now. I think it's so easy to personalize anything, and it can also come across as really stressed when you're like, hey, I noticed you were on such and such podcast, and that was when they were previously two roles behind. So I always say relevancy. If you can get to relevancy, that's the most important piece. The second most important piece is really getting to that level of differentiation or counterintuitive nature. So say something that would literally make them say what? Or that makes no sense. Maybe not that makes no sense, but what or how could that be? Or I've never thought about it that way. Or I actually don't fully understand what they're saying, but there's something there that's interesting. Get them to pause for a minute.

(00:14:13):
And the most important piece is getting this done where, if they get it on their mobile phone, which everyone is looking at their mobile phone and on email, they don't have to scroll. So usually three to four sentences max. That also, that's how a founder writes. That's how an executive writes if you're selling top down. But most importantly, leave them wanting more. Don't say everything, don't even talk about the solution. Talk about the problem that you want to solve, and why it needs to be solved or why it's not good enough today. So those are the four main components. Just to reiterate, relevancy, bring some level of counterintuitive or really different approach to the conversation, focusing in on a problem that's predicated to them, and really concise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
I love this. Is there an example you could share that helps make this even more real? Maybe an email you helped with. And by the way, this is email and LinkedIn, I imagine is where you're communicating mostly?

Jen Abel (00:15:11):
LinkedIn, email, you would be shocked to hear this, but cold calling. I never used to do this. It is one of the most... The interest rates on cold calling are a lot higher than email in many cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:26):
So it's calling, email, cold email and LinkedIn DMs, is that the three channels generally?

Jen Abel (00:15:31):
Yep, those are the three, yeah, the main ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):
Cool. Yeah. Is there an example? It doesn't have to be word for word which you've done or people done, but just how do you... Yeah.

Jen Abel (00:15:38):
Actually our first three years were built on cold email before we actually had clients, before we got word of mouth from the founders we worked with, I cold emailed the first 20 customers we had at Jellyfish. And the line I used in there was zero to one sales talent doesn't exist. That's why I want to have a conversation with you. So that was kind of that leading, wait, what? What does that even mean? And what I would do is tie that to them in some respects. If they recently raised the seed or series A, where they are in that journey. But I would lead with that and then tie it into like, hey, I noticed you're looking to target X, Y, and Z based off of what your website. I'd love to have a conversation with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:25):
And that first piece is the relevance. Here's why this is relevant to you.

Jen Abel (00:16:28):
Yeah. And then I say, our belief at Jellyfish is zero to one sales talent doesn't exist. That's why we built this model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):
Awesome. And you kept it really short. So it's relevance, counterintuitive, keep it really short. And then what was the fourth piece?

Jen Abel (00:16:42):
The fourth piece is just make sure it's concise so that you don't have to scroll on mobile phone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:47):
While we're on this topic. What's a good conversion rate of these sorts of cold outreaches?

Jen Abel (00:16:51):
Conversion rate is interesting. Because everyone's so focused on conversion rate. I get that in the beginning until you have some wins, you have to focus there. But I just want to reverse engineer it backwards a bit. Once you kind of have this, and I'll talk about it in a sec, which is win rate. Win rate is if I got Lenny on a phone call, and he went through the sales process, and I signed him up. And I spoke to 10 Lenny's and only Lenny R was the one that signed. That's one out of 10, that's a 10% win rate.

(00:17:23):
So if you have a really high win rate, let's say 30 or 40%, you actually don't need as high of a conversion rate on the outbound, because you know if you get someone in the funnel, the throughput is very healthy. If your win rate is really low, you need that conversion rate to be much, much higher, because you need more and more and more at bats. So conversion rate is a funny thing. In the beginning I get it because you don't have a lot of customers going through the pipeline yet. But there's people focus on it in a little bit of a false sense because interest rate truly is also dictated by win rate. So I just want to specify that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:03):
That's a really good point.

Jen Abel (00:18:05):
I would say if you're doing a win rate around 15 to 30% and you need to carry, oh I don't know, a million dollar quota. I would say a healthy conversion rate from outbound probably sits around, when it's mature, around five to 7%. Sometimes it could be two to 3%. Sometimes I've seen eight to 15% because it's coming from the founder, and they're solving a really heartfelt problem. So interest rate is also predicated on the problem that the founder has decided they want to solve for, and their insight on that problem.

(00:18:51):
And everyone wants to keep going back to, well, email rate is really low, email doesn't work anymore. LinkedIn, I'm not getting the connects I want. Yes, you can argue that the game has changed a little bit, but when a problem is truly being felt by the market, people will get on a call. People will respond. And if I can compare two engagements at a time that we're running, I see one where it's a 2% interested rate and then I'm seeing another one that's actually at 12% interested rate. And we're doing nothing different. The only thing that's different is the insight that the founder has on the market, which is a hard pill to swallow. And I know that's hard to hear too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:32):
And those are two different companies selling different things?

Jen Abel (00:19:34):
Two different companies selling to two different markets, but they're not fundamentally drastically different markets.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:43):
Got it. But one's basically got more product market fit essentially?

Jen Abel (00:19:46):
That's exactly right. So everyone always comes back to we have the sales problem, we have the sales problem, we have an outbound problem. And yes, there could be some technical things going on that you need to look at. Maybe you leveraged clay and you blasted a thousand people and now your domain health has been impacted. But the vast majority of the time, maybe you're just not saying anything interesting at all. Maybe the problem you're looking to solve just isn't widely felt. Maybe the perspective you have needs another level of refinement because you're just not getting those bites.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
I feel like this question you just touched on is something a lot of founders are always wondering, is this product not the thing people want? Is it my sales skills? I guess I imagine this is a very difficult question to answer, especially quickly. I guess is there anything there that's more likely because of this, it means your product isn't something anyone's want, versus you're not doing a good job selling it?

Jen Abel (00:20:41):
Remember that amazing chart you drew where it talked about the length of time it took? I think you picked the top 25 startups.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:50):
For product market fit timeline [inaudible 00:20:51].

Jen Abel (00:20:51):
Product market fit. Yeah, that amazing image that I think has been reshared more times than anything I've ever seen. It's interesting because if you look at, I was looking at this closely the other day. If you look at the top section where the time to product market fit is consolidated, and you go all the way down to the air tables and the figmas, which a long time to get to product market fit. If you think about the earlier ones, which were, it was like GitHub that had product market fit pretty quickly. The SOC 2 compliant company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
Vanta.

Jen Abel (00:21:23):
Vanta. There's this thing in my head and I haven't fully validated it but I'm going to share it with you, which is did they start with the market problem first and then build the product? Because they knew who their market was right off the bat. Versus an air table and a figma that I think started with a technical insight and then were trying to find their market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:46):
I think that's absolutely right. Vanta, the way they approached it, Christina, she was searching for a pain. She was obsessed with talking to everybody about a pain that they needed solved, and then she just built it in spreadsheets. So she started with the market very much so.

Jen Abel (00:22:00):
And I think product market fit when you start with the market first, it's accelerated. But I will say this, I think that it's also capped on the upside. Because you're starting with the market versus the air table and the figma, which started with the technical insight and has uncapped upside. But one is certainly riskier than the other. Starting with a product is a hell of a lot riskier. And this is where I come back to so many people will say, how did you get funding and not know who your market is? And it's like, because if they do find it, that's a really, really, really big win. Versus I think if you start with the market first, you could potentially get a good win but is it more capped?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:47):
Interesting.

Jen Abel (00:22:48):
I don't know, it's just a thought. I was staring at your grid for so long, I was like, there's something here. And I kept coming back to those were more like I kept breaking it down to market versus product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:01):
Yeah, I love this. I think there's definitely something there. There's also horizontal versus a very specific problem you're solving.

Jen Abel (00:23:06):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:07):
Okay, so you mentioned clay and you kind of nerd sniped me there of just what tools do you find useful? And it makes me think about finding leads, which is kind of going backwards through the sales process, but it might be okay, so maybe let's spend time there. Just like what do you recommend to founders to find the good leads? Glengarry Glen Ross good leads.

Jen Abel (00:23:28):
So I say before you buy any tool, don't even think about tools. I feel like people turn everything into this complicated mess with all of the tools that they start integrating. And then they're engineers, I get it. So now they start to engineer these sales tools together and then they blast their market, and now they have 5,000 notes out in one day and their domain takes a hit. So I think before you even overthink about the tools right now, can you manually find 30 people that you want to spend 15 to 20 minutes writing a rock solid note to? Are there 30 people that you are deeply excited to learn from, that you are willing to invest 15 to 20 minutes to write a really thoughtful note? Let's just start there. So some questions. One, are they even discoverable? How hard is it to find 30 people?

(00:24:21):
What have you noticed across those 30 people? Are there any interesting insights? Maybe it's the size of the team they work on, maybe it's the industry they're in, maybe it's the length of time they've been in their role, maybe it's their previous roles in their career. Are there some commonalities? There's always some level of a commonality usually in most cases. Okay, so now you're starting to collect some parameters. Just by doing this exercise, you're starting to collect some parameters around who you want to learn from and sell to. Now if you send out those 30 notes and you wrote them specifically, and you spend good quality of time on it. And you've hit them on email, you've hit them on LinkedIn, maybe even tried to call them, maybe you've sent them a Twitter DM, pulled out all the stops. How many people respond? 1, 5, 0?

(00:25:15):
If it's zero, it begs the question, do you now want to do another 30 in a very similar fashion? Do you want to change the messaging a little bit? Now it forces these natural experiments. Or do you want to maybe go after a different role? So it forces you to answer these questions in a very manual way before you even think about integrating and spending time on tools. And then you get to a point where it's like, okay, now I'm starting to get some learnings and now I've realized, okay, it's this group of people, I've spoken to maybe two or three, now I want to go out and actually build a campaign to now talk to the next 10 to 15 people in that group. Truncate this as much as you can because I think people focus so much on volume in the beginning.

(00:26:06):
Even if you're selling down market, mid market, enterprise, volume comes once you've identified it and know the parameters. Parameters then allow you to do really strong enrichment with a clay. You now know the types of questions to give it. If you're not asking it the right questions, these enrichment tools, these sales tools will yield nothing. So it all comes back to even before you start your sales call, you need to make sure you're asking the right questions with am I even engaging, or do the people that I want to learn from or sell to, am I even messaging them in the right way? Are they even the right person? And the only way you can do that is by actually truncating these little experiments.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:49):
I love how tactical that is. And what I love is even one of your nuances you mentioned is can you even find them? This gives you a signal of how are... You're going to have to have hundreds of these, thousands of these eventually. If 30 is hard or impossible, you're in trouble already.

Jen Abel (00:27:06):
Totally. And it was funny, I was talking to someone today that said they had a target segment of high net worth individuals that they wanted to go out and serve. I'm like, how do you find those people? I guess when you get to a certain level, your net worth may be public. I don't know. That stuff's very hard to have certain parameters that are undiscoverable. And then if they're undiscoverable and it requires you getting on a call to understand if they are a fit, that does impact conversion rates. Not necessarily in a bad way, but now you need to kind of bring that back into the math equation, which is like, okay, if I speak to 10 people, I know two out of these 10 will be qualified. But I don't know which of those two out of 10. Well, that means you probably need more of those numbers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):
So to quickly recap a few of the key things that I've written down as we're talking. So if you're just trying to figure out who to reach out to, make a list of 30 potential prospects that you think are good fits, that would be excited about what you're building. Spend 15 to 30 minutes writing them each an email. Do these emails have to be really short the way you described previously?

Jen Abel (00:28:12):
I would say the shorter the better, but would you respond to that? If you got this email, would you respond it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:17):
Got it.

Jen Abel (00:28:17):
One of a great little tactical test is on Gmail, you can highlight the message and then have it replay it back to you from an audio perspective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):
Oh wow.

Jen Abel (00:28:28):
You'd be shocked how many notes I've changed when it replays it back and I'm like, oh, that sounds really passive-aggressive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:34):
Interesting. And so you also shared the structure for how to reach out to folks. So let me just share that again. And that applies to this initial email too, but it sounds like as you automate, you want to make it more precise and focused and not... Basically they're not as customized as you start reaching out to more folks.

Jen Abel (00:28:53):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:54):
So start with something, here's why this is relevant to you. You're looking for salespeople in this market. Here's something that's unexpected or surprised, like zero to one salespeople don't exist. Keep it short and then I always forget the last one.

Jen Abel (00:29:14):
Focus on the problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:16):
Focus on the problem.

Jen Abel (00:29:17):
You don't even need to talk about the solution. That's the big takeaway, which is if you get any sales email, you get what's the primary focus of that email? It's usually like here's what we do. But I bet if someone reached out to you with a novel insight and said, I'm really passionate about solving this problem, if it's something you're focused on, you'd probably reply.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:39):
If it's a big problem. If it's like, oh yeah, you're so right, I need this.

Jen Abel (00:29:42):
The beauty with the American market, and I say this because we do a little bit of work with international startups too, is if something doesn't feel right, people love to complain about it. And it's like use that to your advantage. Get that intel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:54):
A note that I just looked at, that I wrote down, that I think is very important is avoid using "this is better" as your pitch.

Jen Abel (00:30:01):
Yeah, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:02):
Different. Here's something shocking about what we're doing. Here's something that'll surprise you.

Jen Abel (00:30:07):
Yeah, or counterintuitive. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:08):
Counterintuitive.

Jen Abel (00:30:09):
Yeah, it's interesting. I spoke to a good friend that leads procurement at a massive organization. And he said to me, he goes, "One of the worst things someone can say to me is we're better than X product. Then I ask them to define that. And then I ask them, okay, how do we measure that? And then I say, okay, should we give this company another year to give them this feedback before we make this huge transition and disrupt momentum?" Yeah, better is a dangerous place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:40):
I invest in a bunch of startups and I find it's impossible to get anyone to care if things are good enough with what they got today. I'm happy not using the best possible product if my life is okay. And I have so many other things I got to do, I'll just deal with this good enough solution for now.

Jen Abel (00:30:57):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):
Okay, amazing. So we talked about how to figure out who to go after, how to pitch them to get them to want to talk. The next step I imagine is you're on the phone with them trying to convince them to actually care. What do you do there? How do you get them to engage further?

Jen Abel (00:31:15):
One is you need to be vulnerable. You're an early stage startup, okay. The market, we're at a point now where the market is smart. I always assume that the buyer I'm speaking to is highly educated and knows way more than I do. So just have that perception because what I've learned is a lot of the market will play dumb, and you can get yourself caught pretty quickly. So when you speak to them, I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We are deeply passionate about solving this specific problem. We have a lot to learn. Here's how we are thinking about it from a problem priority perspective. Can we gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side? And then let them open up. Now you have them one, talking about the problem. Now you're getting the intel about their perception of the problem, and is it even a problem? When you say you're early stage and there's still a lot to be done, it is easier to be honest.

(00:32:20):
If you tell them you have a fully baked, ready to go product, they're not going to give you honest feedback. It's very hard to say to a founder and look them in the eyes and say, hey, we built this product, can I show you what it is? You're just going to get someone that's going to say, oh, this is great, this is wonderful. But when you're vulnerable and when you tell them it's not fully built yet, even if it is, you will get more raw and honest feedback. Because it is easier to tell someone, hey, before you make this mistake, I actually don't care about that. If you've already built it, they're not going to give you that feedback. So the further you suggest you are, you're actually going to hamstring a lot of the intel, hamstring yourself on gaining a lot of the intel. So that's one counterintuitive thing that I think a lot of founders don't realize.

(00:34:14):
So I had April Dunford on the podcast a while ago. I don't know if-

Jen Abel (00:34:17):
She's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:18):
Amazing. And her last book, it actually has the opposite advice, but I think I know why, which is she focuses on later stage companies and her advice is the buyer. She has this really interesting insight that it's harder to buy software now than to sell it, because there's so much to consider and your job is on the line if you make a mistake. It's easier just to be like, forget it, I'm just going to go with what we have today. I don't want to put my ass on the line for buying this new thing that someone's trying. And so her advice is you actually have to educate the buyer on the market and here's what's happening. Here's where things are going, and here's why I think this is the future. But I think again, I think that's focusing on later stage stuff.

Jen Abel (00:34:55):
A hundred percent. And you raised such a good point, Lenny, which is late stage sales and early stage sales are very, very different. And I think that's where a lot of early stage founders get tripped up as they're taking late stage sales advice, usually coming from an investor. Or they've maybe hired a salesperson that's focused on more mature sales. But I think she's spot on. Buying is just as hard, if not harder, than selling right now. Because who wants to make a mistake and also who wants to go through switching costs? Oh, it's so painful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:30):
Yeah. I think the other really important point here that you're making is that part of this initial sales experience of founder led sales is not sell as much as you can. It's to learn what people want. And so I love that you're sharing here's how to get the best possible feedback, not necessarily close the most deals.

Jen Abel (00:35:47):
Totally. And founder led sales is not about revenue on day one. It is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse, so that you can earn the right to sell. There's this concept that I talk about, which is you're going out to run sales to collect the research, which is what founder led sales is. And then you have sales for revenue, which is that post founder led sales stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):
And your milestone that you suggested of how far to take founder led sales, you said around a million ARR, right?

Jen Abel (00:36:20):
Yeah. I think it's about, some people say 500, some people say a million. I think if you get to 500K really, really fast, then I think absolutely you can move out of it. If you get to 500K really, really, really slow, you might not want to get out of it right away. You haven't reached that velocity point yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:41):
Awesome. I have a post that we'll link to that has actually numbers and when all these big startups move from founder led sales. It's in that same series about product market fit. There's two stories this makes me think of I'll share real quick. One is Sprig. They shared a story of first round capital at their first round and their partner there is just like, we will not let you hire a salesperson until you hit a million ARR. We're going to help you. We're going to have salespeople helping you through it, but we're not going to let you hire someone. And he was really happy about that. The other is Zip, which just raised a $2.3 billion valuation, a procurement company that I was lucky to be an investor in. And their first founder led sales motion was they just reached out on LinkedIn to heads of procurement, and just leaned into what you're saving more, which is we just want your advice on this product that we're building. Just tell us what problems you have. It was very advice oriented versus we want to sell you this thing.

Jen Abel (00:37:33):
Yeah, no, absolutely. I have this theory that maybe you shouldn't hire any salespeople until series A, right? Because seed is all about experimentation and proving out that experiment, and then obviously series A is about exploiting that learning. But I see so many people, I mean hiring for early stage sales is the odds are actually more against you than trying to get your next round of funding. Because it's truly, truly such a counterintuitive stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:08):
Interesting. Okay, so I kind of took us on a whole tangent. You were sharing advice on how to get someone excited. So the first is when you're engaging, you're talking to the prospect and company ABC. Your advice is be very honest and vulnerable about your stage. Tell them you're early stage. You're building this thing. You're deeply passionate about this problem. Here's what we're trying to do, here's our priority problem perspective, and where we're focusing, and kind of get their feedback on your approach. Cool. You were going to go to the next tip and I took us off course.

Jen Abel (00:38:44):
Testing the questions to ask. Where is that aha unlock for you? But more importantly, where's that aha moment unlocked for them? Because when they start getting their gears churning in their head about, and this is the beauty about not having a product and not showing them anything, they're visualizing in their head now. This is a really powerful thing, which is like, so tell me how this looks in your head? How are you seeing this? And they're like, I don't know if I can see it. And I'm like, great, we'll show you that. Great insight to know by the way. Or so I think this is how, I guess this is how it would work. Walk me through what's living in your head right now. You pick up on so much and then all of a sudden they're like, wait a second, we've tried solving for this and it's still not solved for. Or you know what? We hired someone last year to manage this. Great understanding. Is it being measured? Is it being managed and have they tried to solve for it? The leading indicators that you're onto something here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:44):
I love this thread because this is what everyone's always like, how do I know if I product market fit? There's these signals that you're talking about of signs that there's something here. Like a big enough pain point where they're excited to basically they want to pay for it, they will pay to solve a problem. So maybe just again, say the things you notice that are signs like, okay, you have something here.

Jen Abel (00:40:03):
So I think the first is it has to be a growing and widening problem. No one's going to spend time fixing a pretty fixed problem, because it's not necessarily really a priority anymore. It's maybe a pain in the butt, but it's not a priority if it's not growing or widening. So gate check one is like, what is the implication? Are you measuring? Are you managing this problem today? Yes or no? If they don't know, great to know. If they said no, okay, move on to the next. That's pretty powerful. No, we're not measuring or managing this. Okay, there's probably not much there. If it is being measured or managed, then the next question you want to get into is how have you tried to solve for it? Is it through that head count that you just hired? Is it through another tool? Is it just still an open gap because nothing exists yet to solve it? Just understand their maturity around how they've tried to plug it. These are all that make the secret moments in intel to close that gap.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):
That's awesome. And essentially it's showing you that there's a pain here that they're paying attention to and are trying to solve.

Jen Abel (00:41:14):
And what you're psychologically doing is now you're flipping them into a buyer where they're like, wait a second, hold on. I need to bring on so-and-so on the next call, they also think that this is not good enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):
That's funny because that's exactly what Wiz noticed, is they moved from people being like, oh, this is cool. I like it, I like it. To, okay, I'm going to pull in this person. I'm going to pull in this person to talk about it and make sure we're... And they were pulling in other people exactly as you described it, because they wanted to move forward on this thing.

Jen Abel (00:41:44):
Absolutely. And that's when you know there's some momentum behind it, which is when they're bringing in other colleagues. Whether it be the potential users, if you're reaching out to the executive, or the users like, hey, I actually want to bring my boss on to the next call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:57):
Good sign. Cool. Anything else along these lines of how to get someone excited slash understand if there's going to be pull there?

Jen Abel (00:42:04):
I guess the one thing is please, please, please do not ask questions like what keeps you up at night? If you had a magic wand, what are your pain points today? I can guarantee you that answer changes every single day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:19):
That's super interesting. Is there any tip for how to end one of these calls, as someone that's never done sales is like-

Jen Abel (00:42:23):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:24):
Okay.

Jen Abel (00:42:25):
Get the second call booked on the first call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:28):
Love it.

Jen Abel (00:42:28):
Pull up calendars. Look at calendars. Who else should be invited? It's just a natural evolution to ending the call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:35):
Great. So that's in 30 minutes though, right?

Jen Abel (00:42:38):
And if they say, ah, I'll email you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:42):
I could say.

Jen Abel (00:42:44):
That's also kind of a leading indicator. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):
So do you recommend not getting off the call, trying to avoid that, or is it just-

Jen Abel (00:42:50):
If they won't give you time on the calendar, you could say, listen, great. Feel free to email me. Maybe they're just being honest and they don't have their calendar available, but nine times out of 10, it's usually I don't have the heart to tell you I'm not interested.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to tell people you're not interested. Very cool. Okay. This is amazing. Okay, so the next step, if I remember correctly, is kind of co-authoring and co...

Jen Abel (00:43:13):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:14):
Okay, cool. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:43:16):
In the early, early days, one of the biggest ways you can get folks excited is it feels like it's going to be built specifically for them. The power of specificity, the power of being extremely focused. With that, you can literally turn a customer into a guide by asking them to co-author the scope. The scope of work. The co-authorship piece is important for two reasons. It helps you understand where they're on their biomaturity. Let me explain. If they do not have an existing process or strategy to solve X problem, they can't buy a technology yet, which means you need to sell them. And this is why I go back to you need to sell them some form of a service, right? Why? You want to be the one in there educating. You also want to get the logo. You also want to show the revenue. While it's not recurring revenue, it still shows intent.

(00:44:13):
And I think that that's really important. Every founder I speak to is like, well, my investor really doesn't want service-based revenue. That's fine. But then you can also tell your investor, great, should I wait 18 months to when they're ready to buy a solution, and be the one that's not the one selling them because someone else educated them? These are all of the implications of waiting. So yes, is service-based revenue great? No, we all know why it's not great. But it's great in the sense that it shows intent. It's great in the sense that you can call them a customer. It's great in the sense that now you can use their logo. And it's great in the sense because you are getting paid to educate them. You are getting paid to help them design their process. This is where all the power lives. And this is why so many AI startups a year and two years ago were going in on services contracts, because they wanted to set the mindset with the buyer around what this would look like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):
Is there anything you recommend to time box contain the services piece? Because I know a lot of companies-

Jen Abel (00:45:12):
Yes, such a great point, Lenny. You absolutely need to time box this. I would time box it as 90 days and then what you can say in the next 90 days, we'll scope where we are and what you need. Scoping out more than 90 days, listen, so much is going to change. You might also not want to do it anymore, so you don't want to lock yourself up. So I would look at 90 day increments. A specific example. We had a founder that my colleague was working with, and they were selling a very specific technology to a non-traditional... Sorry, a very traditional industry. I don't want to be two bleeding with what it is, but a very traditional industry that's not used to working with startups, or necessarily plugging in a new technology right away. And they were very honest. They said, listen, we haven't changed vendors or partners in over five or six years.

(00:46:04):
I actually don't even know how we would do that today. Could you come in and explain to us, understanding where our workflow is and how we would integrate this, before we even consider the technology? Which we did. We got paid a nominal amount, but we're now a customer and now we get to set the stage for how they think about this. And then they won the technology contract. But everyone is so focused on selling the technology really, really, really quickly. That works in markets that know how to buy that technology, have a process in place, have a strategy in place, have an implementation team in place.

(00:46:40):
If it's a new technology like AI right now, they need a strategy and process like who's the human in the loop? Is it them or is it you? How do we measure success? What does success look like? What risks should we be aware of? Our legal team's not even aware of all these risks. You want to be careful because legal can immediately, and procurement, can shut these things down if it seems too novel, where it's foreign versus they're so used to buying services, especially at market. It's their largest budget line item.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:10):
So it's interesting because most founders are very afraid of moving into services. I hadn't heard this advice before.

Jen Abel (00:47:15):
Probably going to get slapped for saying all this stuff, by the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:17):
Well, so along those lines, what percentage of companies that you've worked with or see do that or have to do that step?

Jen Abel (00:47:25):
This is going to be a shocking step. So I would 40 to 50% have to sell some form of service before they can sell a technology.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
Wow. Of B2B SaaS company?

Jen Abel (00:47:36):
A B2B SaaS. And this, again, this is specifically more top-down sales. But yeah, because the user and the buyer are different, which means there's user value, there's buyer value, there's all different players, there's procurement you have to go through. But yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:50):
And just to make it even clearer, what's an example of a service that you've seen company offer in a step?

Jen Abel (00:47:55):
So I've seen, hey, can you come in and actually help me pitch this, design a custom pitch to my boss as to why we should do this today? And we literally got paid to build a sales pitch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
So it's not necessarily providing a service. It could be just helping them sell this.

Jen Abel (00:48:15):
Yeah. It could be helping them sell in a way that makes you... You need to get a lot more context on their business. It can also be, hey, we haven't actually thought about a process for how we can actually deploy something like this. We're currently using this technology, which we want to change from. You've kind of hit this at the right time. How would we implement or how is it best to integrate with this tool? Can we get both of you guys in a room to map this out?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):
Got it. So it's like consultants almost, like coming in to help you solve this problem.

Jen Abel (00:48:47):
It's a great point. It's consulting them towards the acquisition of the product. It's not consulting as one-off consulting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:53):
Got it. And they know that obviously you're biased, but they also want the problem solved. And they're like, great, you're going to help us solve this problem, because it's on my plate and I need your help convincing leadership that this is-

Jen Abel (00:49:04):
And I need to craft the storyline as to why we need to do it anyway, so I will pay you to do it, but here's the format it needs to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):
Fascinating. Wow. Okay. Anything else along those lines?

Jen Abel (00:49:15):
And then of course, if you're in a position to actually sell the technology, because the market is able to acquire and adopt it and not have to create a new strategy or process, then obviously sell the technology. You don't need to be selling services.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
I want to come back real quick. The previous call, I wrote this note down as you were talking. You recommended not doing a demo and just talking about it broadly.

Jen Abel (00:49:34):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:34):
Is that your advice there?

Jen Abel (00:49:36):
On the first call. Yeah. On the first call, my fundamental belief is that the demo is a bit of the only carry you control in the sales process, right? Once they see it, it's kind of like pitching an investor. Once they take a look under the hood, that dreaminess in their eyes, they're like, oh, I saw it. So leave them wanting more. And the demo is that, leave them wanting more. Even when you do a demo, don't demo everything. Leave it for a second call. Let them invest a lot of time in you. Again, if it's qualified. Preface that, if it's qualified. But everyone races through the sales process like let's do a demo call as quickly as humanly possible.

(00:50:20):
Yes, that is important down market. That is important if you're selling a $3,000 tool, you absolutely want to be demoing as fast as humanly possible because it's a high-volume game. Upmarket, when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, you want to slow that down as fast as possible. Because you want to, one, make sure all of the right people are in the room. As soon as there's one lead on this, and if it requires other people involved, it doesn't feel like anyone else's baby. So you want it to make it feel like the group's baby versus this one individual's baby because it's very quick. Someone can easily say, I'd rather use this tool. And then there's this stalemate of nothing happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:55):
Just to maybe reiterate, so far we've talked about figure out who to talk to, pitching them on talking to you, then having that first conversation. Maybe there's another conversation in there to get them excited. And then there's just getting them past the finish line, keeping everyone aligned. Is that roughly the next step or how should we think about this?

Jen Abel (00:51:14):
Yeah, so if you are selling upmarket and you now need to go to procurement, who is the group involved in the bot. They're the professional buyers. Procurement is a very interesting function. They are very smart, very, very smart. They do this for a living. They are professional buyers. So there's a couple things that you need to be aware of. You need to sell them as well. You need to really make this sound... Don't over complicate it. Don't add in jargon. Make it feel like, okay, I can wrap my head around this. The second piece is it's got to feel different from anything else out there. Because the professional buyer, it's much easier to say, wait a second, we have these 17 other preferred vendors that do similar ish work. Why don't you just go use one of them? Because, oh, by the time this gets through procurement, it could be another three to four months.

(00:52:05):
I've seen deals die on the vine because procurement actually suggested they go use another vendor in the system, that this buyer wasn't even aware of, because they didn't differentiate. It didn't feel different. It just felt slightly better. That's how it was positioned. The third piece is when you get to procurement, you're going to have to do all the work. Make their job easy. You are probably a very small piece into the very large deals that a lot of these people buy. So you can get easily sidelined just because you're just a small buy. So do the work for them. Literally say, I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Give me the forms that you need to fill out. I'll fill them out for you, and you can do it yourself. You can edit them. Do the lift for them. If you don't, it's so easy for it to just go there and die.

(00:52:55):
Another piece that's important with procurement is explaining exactly what you do and don't do. Because if you say you do a bunch of things and they can't really place you, they're going to send you to the kitchen sink of contracting an MSA, which is going to ask you for $5 million in an insurance policy and all sorts of other things. And the ability to look at your book at any point in time. And the reason they did that is because they can't classify you. So the easiest thing to do is classify you as high risk. So make it easy for them, make it simplified. You can also truncate your contracts, meaning let's say IT is maybe, and you want to ask this, how long does it take to get through IT due diligence? They might say, oh, it's a 90-day backup, it's a 60-day backup, it's a 30-day backup.

(00:53:43):
There's no backup. If there's a backup, you also don't want it to die and you want it to give an incentive. So this is when you want to truncate contracts to a technology contract and a service contract. Service contract allows you to onboard them, get them prepped, come in and educate all of the users about what they're about to go through. So that then there's an incentive to get that technology piece through. There's all these little things to think about, and I think everyone... Getting to procurement is also creative. And knowing who you're dealing with and how to make their job as easy as humanly possible. Because what you said and what April said is spot on, which is buying is just as hard as selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:23):
As I'm hearing you describe this, I feel like we might be discouraging people from selling because this feels very not fun. All these steps, all these procurement work, anything you can say to get people to feel like, okay, this is worth it?

Jen Abel (00:54:35):
Yes, I can get people very excited by this. Once you are in, you are in. Once you are in, you are now a preferred vendor. You now have the ability to cross over into other business units. You are now the reason that, hey, if your competitor comes in, well, you got there first. So what do you think procurement's going to say? This is why it's so important to get into the enterprise as fast as humanly possible. While it's a headache to get through, if you project manage it, you'll be good. If you make an accountability, just like if you were to go through fundraising. If you are a part of a team that had to raise money, it's no different. There's always some level of due diligence. There's always you doing more of the work than them. That's just enterprise sales. But if you prove value, your hundred thousand dollars deal could be $500,000 next year. Your $500,000 deal could be a million dollars the following year.

(00:55:36):
This is where stuff begins to compound, and this is where your growth journey really gets accelerated. So the beauty with enterprise is once you're in, you're in. You beat out your competitor for a short period of time. There is a little bit of a moat there, but it's not forever. You all have intel that no one else will have. Meaning you're a part of the conversations, you have the badge, you can join the meetings, you can ask for introductions. They'll do it. It doesn't feel like sales anymore. You're now a partner. This is why it's so powerful to get into the enterprise because there's so many compounding effects. If you put the effort in on the sales side, the return is insane.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):
That was awesome. Nailed it. I'm excited. Just for folks that are listening, just to calibrate what size of company you're talking about selling to here, what's the size of the advice you've been sharing so far? Roughly?

Jen Abel (00:56:33):
So I've been talking a lot about enterprise sales, which is I would say anywhere north of 500 to a thousand employees. Just mental model. I'm talking about enterprise sales specifically because there's so much nuance involved in it, because the user and the buyer are very different, right? As you go down market, let's talk about small business for a second. The user and the buyer are the same person. There's no procurement. If they like what you've built, it's pretty straightforward process. In the mid-market, mid-market is a funky place because you either are anchoring towards the lower end of mid-market, which is more upper end of small business, or you're anchoring towards lower end enterprise. Those are two very different divides. So mid-market, just if you're talking about lower end enterprise, again, this is all relative. If you're talking about lower end small business, again, your user and the buyer probably are the same person, which makes sales a lot more streamlined.

(00:57:31):
But churn. Small business, challenge with small business is the churn. If they get pissed off, if they don't feel like it's good enough, they are gone faster than you don't even realize. And they might even tell you. They'll just cancel. And we always see this on Twitter. They'll call American Express and say, cancel these charges. I don't want to talk to these people anymore. They're just more irrational because sometimes maybe it's their money if they're a small business. So small business in mid-market, while sales is a bit faster, you really got to be on the product market fit side, worried about churn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):
And they also go out of business at a higher rate.

Jen Abel (00:58:07):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):
And so you have that kind of churn.

Jen Abel (00:58:12):
A churn piece too. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:14):
Amazing. Okay. What comes next? So we're kind of in procurement at this point.

Jen Abel (00:58:19):
Okay, so now we're at signature, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:21):
Okay.

Jen Abel (00:58:21):
Okay. So as you enter procurement, okay, you want to know before you get to the next stage, who is signing this deal? Here are some examples of signers I've seen. Chief financial officer, chief legal officer, the business unit head themselves, the head of procurement. You want to know who that person is so that you can literally say to the head of procurement, hey, listen, I want to make sure this person has everything they need when they review this, to know what they're signing. Who is it and how can I give you a few bullets to share that you can maybe respond to, that we get tight so that they know exactly what they're looking at?

(00:58:59):
This was two or three years ago, I was involved in getting a deal over procurement that was just truly, it was a pharmaceutical company and it was very, very long process. And we got to the finish line and the CFO was the signature. And this is when I made the mistake. CFO responds back to the procurement lead who sent it to the business unit, who sent it to me and was like, what am I signing? I don't actually understand what these people are doing and why are we doing this?

(00:59:32):
So then she quickly said to me, hey, listen, we need to defend this. Can you put together some bullets? And I'm like, well, what kind of bullets do I need? What does this person care about? And again, it created so much anxiety and now I'm back in the bottom of the queue. Probably he or she's looking at the things that come in in an order of priority. So now I've elongated this by another month simply because I didn't plan. So this is just to say I'm learning from my own mistake of know who the signature is, because if they don't know what they're looking at, they're going to kick it out and you're going to lose your queue spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):
So many ways to fail. And this was you selling Jellyfish or this was you working with a company?

Jen Abel (01:00:11):
This was me helping [inaudible 01:00:15].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):
Oh man. Okay. Anything else in that step that might be helpful to folks?

Jen Abel (01:00:19):
Yes. One thing to caveat is you do not get paid until you are approved by finance, and procurement has a signature on the contract. Meaning don't start any work. Or if you do start work, know that there is no payment. The business unit can't just pay you. It's paid through a purchase order, which is paid through by finance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
So don't rely on that money unless it's finally, unless the signature's on the paper. Quick tangent, thoughts on discounting at any parts of the journey?

Jen Abel (01:00:54):
If there is a reason as to why. So discounting just to get the deal over the line, you're negotiating with yourself. Unless they ask for it and then ask them to defend it. Certain segments, like small business, you should leave a little bit of room for buffer because sometimes that's their own money. It's like their own small business. Mid-market and enterprise, there's got to be a reason why and ask them. Be like, hey, so if I give you a 30% discount, can I remove 30% of the value? You can kind of play it a little bit like that. I don't recommend it, but that's kind of what they're saying. But discounting is great if they're doing something for you far and beyond. For example, if they're a design partner, if they're going to be a reference for two years, if they're going to give you something far beyond just using the technology, then yeah, I think a discount is a good reason to give back to somebody that's giving to you, but not as a strategy to get a deal done.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:57):
Okay. Is there anything beyond this step of getting the signature? Are we done?

Jen Abel (01:02:01):
Yeah. I hope you celebrate because-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):
Okay, great. You got a signature from this whole process.

Jen Abel (01:02:08):
Yeah. Hopefully I'm not making this sound too daunting. I'm just really trying to lay out all the mistakes I've made.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):
Yeah, no, this is exactly what people need. This is amazing. And your pep talk was really helpful too. Along the way. What's the general timeline for sales process like this in your experience, with these 500 plus ice companies?

Jen Abel (01:02:26):
So there's three things that dictate sales cycle. One is how well are you project managing it? For example, I'll say, let's have our second or third call in two weeks. Two weeks? Do a week. Why are you elongating this? Keep your calls as tight as possible because that shortens your sales cycle. The second is just how complex the organization is. If you're dealing with a highly regulated industry, just know it's going to take a bit longer, sometimes 20 to 30% longer. So a highly regulated industry, nine to 12 months on conservative, on the conservative side. Again, it's tricky because is there a budget line item dictated towards it yet, or are you creating budget? How painful is the problem? And how senior have you gone? If you're talking to the SVP or chief of whatever, they're pretty good at about being able to navigate the traps.

(01:03:28):
If you're dealing with a director or mid-level person, they maybe have not purchased something before and just make some internal mistakes. I always say it can range anywhere. I've seen enterprise deals close in 90 days, believe it or not. Rare, but I've seen it. I've also seen enterprise deals typically take anywhere between six and 12 months. Really important but. Enterprises know that the process and the length to get the deal done is what costs more than the technology itself. Meaning the effort it takes to get through their system. That's why they're willing to spend so much. Sometimes that's actually more expensive than the technology itself. So don't negotiate with yourself, understand the value you're delivering, but don't be crazy. I've seen people try and go in with a million dollar deal as a seed stage startup. Oh, interesting thing. So interesting tactic. I've seen contracts in the enterprise that state that the deal cannot exceed more than 20% of the existing revenue.

(01:04:39):
So there are these things just to be aware of. In most cases, you can ask them be like, is that a hard line? Is that hard, hard line? Or how negotiable is that? Sometimes it's negotiable. Sometimes it's like, no, this is a hard rule. But then it seems silly because you take a hundred thousand dollar deal and bring it down to 20,000. It's just be careful that you're stripping some of the value out. But I kid you not. I've seen an enterprise deal go from, it lands at 60 and it turns into 280,000 in four months. So again, I want to encourage, yes, this is a lot of work, but the payoff is exponential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):
What's a good ACV to start with if you're trying to sell to enterprise, to make it all worth it for your startup?

Jen Abel (01:05:25):
I would say anywhere between 50 to 200K depending on the business unit you're selling to. That's kind of like sweet spot. They're used to something in that realm.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:35):
And this is a startup selling [inaudible 01:05:38].

Jen Abel (01:05:37):
Early stage startup, like founder led, early stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Initial contract. Wow.

Jen Abel (01:05:43):
Yep. Initial contract. I would say, okay, probably caters more towards like 50 to 100K. But I've seen people sell to... Again, it's how big is the problem? Who are you selling it to? Is it the SVP that you started with and they've got a large budget, and it's a pretty healthy business unit? Or are you selling to a director?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:05):
If you're not able to sell your product at that price? What's your advice to teams?

Jen Abel (01:06:10):
If you are a startup, I always ask the founder, did you build this for the enterprise and is that the model you want to play? Or did you build this for small business? Small business is a marketing game. Marketing intensive activity, right? It's high velocity, high volume, lots of dials. It's a very different game than enterprise. So which game do you want to play? Let's just start there. Which game is more attractive to the founder. Or who is more exciting to serve? What's the storyline you want to tell investors? That plays a lot of it into it too. And do you have an enterprise product? Are you solving an enterprise problem or do you think you're solving an enterprise problem but you're not sure yet?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:53):
And your point is also mid-market is it's rarely to be successful.

Jen Abel (01:06:57):
It's hard to start there because you're straddling two very different go-to-markets, right? One that's of high value, one that's of high volume. And also mid-market companies, this is where a lot of people don't... If it requires heavy integration, they don't have those resources. That's usually outsourced to an Accenture or some of these consulting firms, and now you're having to rely on third parties to be involved. It gets messy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):
This is fascinating. I have a list of questions from the audience that you pulled from Twitter. You asked on Twitter what questions to ask you as you're coming on here. So there's one that's very related to this, which is someone said, if you're still very early in pre-product market fit, but get initial validation from both small to medium businesses and enterprise, how do you decide which one to focus on? Is there a counter argument against starting or SMB going up market over time like most companies do?

Jen Abel (01:07:51):
I've seen companies successfully do in both of those motions. Truthfully. We know all of those. We know people that started small business and worked their way up into enterprise and were successful. We've seen people be really successful by starting at the enterprise, like a Wiz. That's more of an internal question, which is like, who did you build this for? Where's the problem most felt and which go-to-market game do you want to play?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):
And I think that latter part is so important. It sounds like why should it be what I want? It's like what's going to make a big business? But I think people forget, this is going to be your life for 10 years. Do you want to be selling to enterprises and building all the enterprise features? Would you prefer to build for small companies? Pros and cons to both but it's important to think about the life you're creating for yourself and your team.

Jen Abel (01:08:36):
A hundred percent. And I built my career in enterprise sales, upper-end mid-market enterprise sales, and yeah, that's just the game I know the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:46):
Yeah, that's also an important part of it. Just to double down on that is like what do you have experience doing? Not like...

Jen Abel (01:08:52):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:53):
Yeah. Where's the opportunity? Okay. Another question that I love is, and we touched on this initially, but I think it's good to come back to this. Someone said, customers are fascinated with what we're offering from the initial calls, but responsive momentum is too slow from their end. Would be great to know how to fix this.

Jen Abel (01:09:10):
Yeah, it's tough because unless you're in the weeds to understand why. I'll give you a few examples that it could be. Did you speak to a buyer who now is trying to sell this up to their boss, and it's just getting sidelined and they don't know the executive value? They've just been selling the buyer value the whole time. That's one reason things can slow down. Another reason things can slow down is you haven't really framed the problem well and they don't understand the full implications of why they need to solve it. So it's kind of just sitting there a little bit. The third is they've just been really nice and it's not going to go anywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:49):
I guess that that's usually the latter. Was that true or it's kind of all over the place?

Jen Abel (01:09:54):
It's so hard to give a founder hard feedback. Because they've just dedicated their life to this thing. Who wants to be the bearer of bad news? And sometimes you just need to let the actions speak louder than words.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:11):
We've talked about all these steps. I'm curious, when you come to a founder or your team, where do you find the most on lock often? Which of the steps of the sales process do you find the biggest opportunity to improve conversion in sales?

Jen Abel (01:10:25):
It's qualification. Qualification because if you spend your time on the wrong leads, that equates to a zero. So if you don't get that first level right, let me put it this way, everyone that I know says they have a bottom of funnel problem. It's never a bottom of funnel problem. It's a top of funnel problem. I've actually never seen a bottom of funnel sales problem. It's always qualification, which is a symptom of not reaching out to the right person, not having the right messaging, not solving the right problem, or not being different enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
I love this. So basically the biggest pitfall people fall into, in your experience, is they're just talking to the wrong people, wasting their time?

Jen Abel (01:11:15):
Yeah. Talking to the wrong people or using the wrong message or...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Pitching them something they can't actually deliver.

Jen Abel (01:11:23):
Yeah. Here's the other thing too. Sales is supposed to feel fun for the buyer. They should be like, this feels fun. This person's invigorating. They're going to change my world. They're going to make me see things differently. They're going to get me promoted. They're going to help me increase my influence internally. And so many salespeople are so boring. How many times have you got off a call and you're like, I can't wait to get off this call? And founders too, just like all of a sudden their passion, they go like stone cold face. And it's like bring the passion. Bring the energy. That is felt by the market. Remember, some of these people are in boring jobs. Give them an outlet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:01):
So along those lines, I think a lot of people are just not... Like me included. I feel weird doing sales. It's a weird experience trying to convince someone to buy something. Is there any advice you could share to get someone over that hump?

Jen Abel (01:12:13):
If you have built something that you believe in. Very hard to sell something you don't believe in. I think everyone agrees that. If you've built something you believe in and they have a problem, that's a beautiful thing. Truthfully, that's what makes the world go around, is I have a solution to your problem. Now you just need make sure that the problem, you just need to be honest, that the problem they have, your solution truly can solve for. And you're not short selling just to get a logo and a deal over the line, and see them churn in six months or nine months or three months. That what you are selling is truly going to solve their problem. And be honest about it. I can't tell you enough when I tell someone, listen, I don't think I'm the right fit for you. They try and sell you on them.

(01:12:58):
They're like, well, wait a second. Hold on. What if we did this, this, and this? And it's like, no, no, no. Here's what we're great at. And then they can say, well, I also need that too. And all of a sudden, this level of trust comes out. And trust is the number one currency in sales. If you are a trusted salesperson, people will recommend you all day and every day. If you're a trusted founder, your market will continually send you leads and word of mouth. So don't try and sell something just to prove to investors you sold something, because it'll be quickly seen on the other side when they churn.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):
Amazing. Okay, Jen, so I'm going to cut the lightning round. I know you also have to run and do real work. So let me give you a chance just to talk about what you do, how you help companies in case folks can find value in working with you.

Jen Abel (01:13:44):
Deeply passionate about sales, as I'm sure you can tell. We specifically help founders through this pain. Navigating enterprise sales, mid-market sales, and really trying to crack that first million of ARR. Or sometimes even that first 500K of ARR if they move fast enough. And it is really hard. It's counterintuitive to what most people think, but it can be really, really fun when we show you the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):
And you described to me how it works, and I think it's important to clarify this. You basically embed with the team and help them do this.

Jen Abel (01:14:19):
Yes. So I fundamentally do not believe in outsourcing the heartbeat of the organization, which is sales. So what we do is we embed alongside the founder and drive a lot of the execution, but make sure that they are the tip of the spear engaging directly with their market, and learning directly from the market's mouth, not playing this game of telephone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):
Amazing. And I mentioned this when we were chatting, but I think of it again, is when I was interviewing all these companies about how they started selling early on. One of the interesting threads that I heard again and again, is how many of them hired a coach or a consultant as a founder to help them learn to do sales. And that's essentially what you do. And I didn't even know a service like this existed, so this is super cool. It'll point people to what you do. I also have to ask you, the question I ask everyone at the end is just, how can listeners be useful to you?

Jen Abel (01:15:08):
Help each other out. I think so many people have helped me in my career, and in this journey, that the pay it forward model that exists in the technology space is so beautiful. So just don't let that die.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Beautiful. Well, Jen, thank you so much for being here.

Jen Abel (01:15:32):
Lenny, this was awesome. Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:34):

# $1M to $10M: The enterprise sales playbook with Jen Abel

## Transcript

Jen Abel (00:00:00):
You need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity. The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
Most founders would rather get 10, 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal.

Jen Abel (00:00:17):
In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you. If they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
It might be giving you a false sense of success and product market fit.

Jen Abel (00:00:34):
As soon as you become a comparison, as soon as you become one of three that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost. It's all about differentiation. Here's what you will be able to do tomorrow because of how we're going to serve you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
Something else that you talk about is that enterprise sales is very creative.

Jen Abel (00:00:52):
It's more of an art. It's all about deal crafting. It is a relationship you're building with someone. If they know they can call on you, people will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, "It's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible?" And she's like, "It's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it." These are how enterprise deals gets done. It's relationships.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
What's kind of like the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling?

Jen Abel (00:01:18):
I don't use a tool. The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is trick or treating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guest is Jen Abel, co-founder of JJELLYFISH where she and her team help early stage founders learn how to sell and now GM of Enterprise at State Affairs.

Jen Abel (00:04:45):
Lenny, it's starting to feel familiar and I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
I should have said welcome back to the podcast. So I actually shared on Twitter that you're coming back and I had so many people ask so many questions. Clearly, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of need for learning how to get better at the stuff, we're going to talk about sales, enterprise sales to frame the discussion, our first chat, which we're going to point people to if they want to start there, we focused on founder-led sales, which is essentially the beginning phases of a startup, kind of going from zero to about 100 million ARR.

(00:05:17):
This discussion is on the next phase, which is going from about a million ARR to about 10 million ARR in enterprise sales, not like PLG or anything like that. You have a bunch of really strong and counter intuitive opinions and piece of advice on how to be successful at this. So I'm just going to go through a bunch of these things. We'll see where it goes. Before we get into the first one, is there anything broadly, I don't know, is there anything broadly you want to share? Anything you want to say before we dive in?

Jen Abel (00:05:41):
No, let's dive right in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:42):
Okay. Okay, so the first thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about before is this point that you often make that the mid-market does not exist. People often hear about enterprise companies. There's obviously SMBs and startups. There's also people just, "Oh, I'm going to go after the mid-market." Somewhere between. You don't think that's real? Talk about your experience there, what people should know.

Jen Abel (00:06:03):
It's fascinating because if you ask someone to describe the mid-market, actually, if you ask someone to describe the enterprise, every single person has a different answer. It's either based off of revenue, it's either based off of market cap, it's based off of employee size, and I think a lot of people can get lost because selling to a hundred person organization is a radically different game than selling to a thousand person organization and there's no hybrid approach.

(00:06:35):
So the best way to think about it is you have small business which typically can be really powered by marketing, and then you have enterprise, which is typically going to be sales led. If you bucket them into these two very specific silos, it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're playing. Now, when we talk about mid-market, I usually will say, "Are we talking about the upper end of small business or are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?"

(00:07:04):
And most people are usually saying the lower end of enterprise. And I say, "Great, know you're playing the enterprise game. Know the type of people you need to hire, the type of ACV they need because it makes it a lot easier than trying to have this middle ground that catches everything that doesn't distinctly define SMB and enterprise." So I say the mid-market doesn't exist because what is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB, and if you bleed those two games you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different. So that's kind of my theory on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
You have this chart that you shared with me that will link people to where you kind of show the number of companies within each of these segments and there's basically nobody in this kind of middle segment, talk about that a bit.

Jen Abel (00:07:46):
That's right, and just like the power laws, if you look at the Fortune 1,000 and then the lower end enterprise from there, it trails off so fast. Power laws totally exist in these large corporations and we can't be treating everyone the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):
This begs the question, where do you suggest companies start? There's obviously startups classically are just like innovators, move fast, can make quick decisions, enterprises have all the money. Usually the advice I hear is just don't go after the fancy companies to start because they take a long time. You don't want to screw it up. What's your advice on where to start for most companies?

Jen Abel (00:08:30):
The exact opposite. Early adopters are those logos because they have to continue to stay at the number one spot. So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay in the ... Staying in the number one spot is the hardest part. So those number one logos are like if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha, just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted, that's where I get the pat on the back because we are the world's leader in our industry and we cannot be disrupted there.

(00:09:05):
So there's this running joke where not a running joke, there's this running statement where a lot of VCs will say, "Don't go after tier one logos, go learn down market." Or, "o learn from logos that don't necessarily carry a lot of weight." The ones that carry all the weight are the ones that are willing to take a shot and want to help, right? Because they also want to be, they also want to be able to dictate the roadmap.

(00:09:30):
Now it's the founder's job to decide what can be done and what shouldn't be done, but their voice takes you a $100,000 deal into a million dollar deal in a very short period of time. It will literally guide you there. So when someone says, "Hey, go after startups, such as short sales cycle." Yeah, that makes sense. I totally get that. It's very easy to define the decision maker.

(00:09:54):
It's very easy, you don't have to go through procurement, but in the age of AI where it's all about sucking the oxygen out of the room and winning the deal and getting your foot in the door as quickly as humanly possible before someone else tries to take that, you want to get to the enterprise as fast as humanly possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Just so folks understand what we're talking about here, when you say tier one, what's a good way to think about what tier one is?

Jen Abel (00:10:16):
Tier one is like your Walmarts, your McDonald's, your NVIDIAs, your Tesla, your ExxonMobil, your UnitedHealthcare, the logos that are the leader in their space, their job is to stay in the number one spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:35):
Wow. Your advice is because this is very counterintuitive. This is exactly what you're here not to do. Your advice is go after the Chevrons and the Mobils and the Walmarts as a startup.

Jen Abel (00:10:46):
Because if you can get them, that's all the proof you need.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
How do you approach finding someone? Let's just get tactical there. Just like say you're going after Walmart. I know this is not a five-second answer, but just how would someone approach finding someone at Walmart to sell to?

Jen Abel (00:11:01):
First of all, make sure the founder is involved, right? Everyone loves talking to a founder, so we'll start with let's get the founder involved as fast as human possible. The second is you need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. There's a very big difference between problem selling and gap selling. Problem selling is highly specific, more technical than not, and it's the way that every salesperson is going to go about it, find the problem and anchor to it.

(00:11:33):
When you're selling to a leader, you need to be vision casting and you need to be selling an opportunity which is they are here, here's where we can take you. You know that image where it's like Mario or Mario, and then there's the mushroom and then there's Mario on blast, and everyone is like, "Don't sell the mushroom, sell Mario on blast." Well, that's exactly what it's saying.

(00:11:57):
It's about selling the opportunity. That's what gets the tier one logos excited and that is the best thing for a founder to sell, selling the vision versus the problem, and also it's what gets them to want to take a swing. Who wants to take a swing because you can do some small problem? They're not going to go to bath for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):
What's an example of a vision cast in a company you've worked with just to make this real? What does it look like when you've done a great job?

Jen Abel (00:12:23):
We have an ability to deliver alpha, meaning, we have information, we have data, we have a way of working that no one else can do or is going to unlock a new way of thinking for you or an ability to deliver to a customer or an ability to solve a problem. Right now, you have an ability to access this level of information. I have an opportunity through our resources or through this gated data, we have access to get you much further upstream so that you can get information faster sooner. It's kind of like the high-frequency trading that one second, that one second. They didn't do much. They didn't sell, "Oh, we're doing fiber cable connectivity. We're giving you one second of alpha before everyone else." It's more of that ability and that's not problem-selling, that's opportunity selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:14):
I like this phrasing of just giving them alpha, that's such a simple way to imagine what this should feel like. We'll link to that image you're talking about with the Mario and-

Jen Abel (00:13:22):
You know that image?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
Yeah, the person that made that image originally is Kathy Sierra, if you remember her, do you remember? So there's this person, Kathy Sierra, she's from back in the day. This was a big, I don't know, lesson she taught is you want to not sell your people on a feature or a product. You want to sell them on them becoming a superhero.

Jen Abel (00:13:42):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):
They are now a superhero because of the thing you've built for them. And so the vision here is here's how you become a superhero. Here's how this alpha will help you become more successful.

Jen Abel (00:13:50):
And that's why founders are so good at selling because they naturally go to vision selling and vision casting versus a typical trained salesperson is find the problem, ask these questions and it just kills the vibe. It just feels like you're talking to a salesperson, right?

(00:14:08):
It's like, "What's your script? And it's like that's not vision selling, that's like playbook selling." And in the age of AI where a lot of it is Alpha, it's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data, and look at how the market is reacting to it. It's all opportunity and it's all about the alpha.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:30):
So just to make this more concrete for people, Sam, like sales person at Cursor, what would be an example of vision casting? The obvious idea there is your team will be more productive, you'll get more done faster than everybody else. Is that a big enough vision to cast?

Jen Abel (00:14:47):
I think it may be more of you'll be able to actually hire the 10X engineers that you don't necessarily have access to because they want to be able to use this type of tool. It's about letting them get differentiated talent or that's probably more of what I would anchor to of this is the 10X engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10X engineers?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:16):
They won't even join your company if you're not using Cursor.

Jen Abel (00:15:18):
Yeah, yeah. Think about it. So many people are so specific about what they're able to, I think especially technical folks, I'm not a technical person, but I would imagine that they're not going to go to, they don't like to go to these corporations because they're forced to use some incumbent tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
Going back to going after these larger companies, I asked your colleague, Justin, what he sees you do that most impacts the success that teams have with their sales process. And there's a bunch of I'm going to touch on, but one is most founders are insecure about asking for large ACVs for charging, or the way he put it is most founders would rather get 10 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal. Talk about your advice there and what you see.

Jen Abel (00:16:04):
There are in the very early days is people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you because that's like a qualification criteria, which is like if they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you being like, "No, I don't believe it's worth this. I don't believe it's worth that." They're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

(00:16:32):
So when I say I'd rather get $100,000 deal than $10,000 deals, I'd rather have one rock star client that's going to help me figure out the next stage of where this is going than 10 or maybe five that are a good fit, five that are not, and I still have to serve those five that are not a good fit, and that's going to distract me. So this is why I love enterprise sales is they're not going to do the hard work of bringing you in if it's not critical or if it's not, when I say critical, it's going to impact them in a way that they're going to make it successful, that's what I love about enterprise sales.

(00:17:14):
They have the resources to ensure that it gets implemented because most in today's day and age, if people are not using the tool, you just get rid of the tool. So they're going to want to make sure whatever they bring in, what they go to bat for, remember, they go to bat once every two years, maybe once every three years. You've got to make it feel incredible. You've got to make it feel like they're going to be a superhero going back to it.

(00:17:42):
Otherwise, what's the point? Because the way enterprises are structured is it is designed today to make it hard to buy because they want to make sure whatever you're bringing in, you really, really want it gets rid of the mediocre. I think this would be good and it gets to this is going to change the way we work. It's going to impact our ability to capture some form of alpha, however you want to define that for them and it's sticky because of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:16):
So your advice here broadly is don't pay attention to the smaller 10K-ish kind of opportunities for a bunch of reasons. One is it might be giving you a false sense of success in product market fit. Two, those companies are maybe not as innovative and won't lead you in the right direction. Three are probably discounts just like your product than your pricing just gets thrown off.

Jen Abel (00:18:38):
Yep, and also you don't really get taken seriously for 10K. You get way more taken seriously for a 100Ks, it's much harder to get a 100K deal done and an executive use needs to be involved. I'd much rather have an executive sign-off on something and spend two more months getting the deal done because you know that they are bought in, you can now ensure what kind of value do they want to unlock and maybe you have an opportunity to turn them into a user, which to me, in today's day and age, with our generation being the ones that are now the executives at these corporations, this is native to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:15):
Who is this true for? Is the advice here basically, if you're trying to build a successful B2B company, everybody should be aiming towards these a 100K sort of deals? Is there a world where you can be successful with 10Ks for a long time?

Jen Abel (00:19:30):
If you have a super high win rate in a massive market, because all you have to do is reverse engineer the math. If you need to generate a hundred million dollars in revenue, how many 10K deals do you need? And the expansion on a 10K deal is in parallel to that. Where can you go? 10 to 15? That's a 50% growth, much easier to go to a 100K to 500K because they want more bodies or they want more value out of you.

(00:19:58):
For an enterprise, they'd love to get more out of an existing customer. You're already trusted. So it's also about the type of company you are. If you're venture-backed, you can't be selling $10,000 deals to the enterprise, you'll get killed, or you've already lost the game because you're playing a small business game in the wrong sector.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:17):
Have you seen startups you've worked with succeed in that 10K, 20K bucket or is it really, really rare?

Jen Abel (00:20:23):
If they're going after the enterprise?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Yeah.

Jen Abel (00:20:25):
Yes, if it's the first three months and then after three months, it turns into a 50K and then a 100K and it ramps up quickly. Sure, that makes sense. You got your foot in the door and you can expand it exponentially in a healthy manner. I think that that's fine. $10,000 a year, then going to 12, then going to 15, the math will break.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
This is great. I feel like most founders to this are like, "No, no, we're kind of in that exception we'll be all right. 10K, we'll do 20K. That's crazy to consider 100K."

Jen Abel (00:20:52):
Yeah, the math will break. And also, a really good salesperson, you're commissioned on a 10K deal, they're not going to get a great salesperson. They're going to want to be anchored to how can I sell a $250,000 deal? How can I sell a half a million dollar deal? That's the type of person you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
And a big part of this is this is a good lens to force you to build the product that you can sell for 100K, 500K.

Jen Abel (00:21:19):
Yeah, absolutely. And again, this is about playing that enterprise game. If you're trying to sell, if you're a small business, if you're in the small business place and an enterprise company comes to you and is like, "I like this." Ensure that you structure it for an enterprise. Don't play the small business team with an enterprise company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:38):
Talk more about that. What does that mean?

Jen Abel (00:21:40):
Let's say you're PLG, and a big company like Walmart comes to and is like, "Hey, can we get access for three of our users?" And they're like, "This is so exciting." And then they sell them the small business pricing for three users to Walmart. Very, very hard now to go from those three users that you just priced them at in a small business way, turn that into 100K because now it's documented what they're actually paying for this.

(00:22:08):
So you're stuck. You've kind of anchored yourself to this price. Not to mention how are you going to unlock the executive high level value so that you can get that senior executive to buy in and stamp this as well. Otherwise, it's just going to be throwing it on the credit card. But again, you've just ruined your enterprise game because you're anchoring to a small business price.

(00:22:34):
So this is why when you bleed these two games, it's very, very, very dangerous because these are really smart companies. They're going to say, "Well, wait a second, I just paid $9,000 last year and now you want to charge me $90,000. Well, what's the step change in value? What's the 10X value I'm now getting?" That's super hard to prove.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:54):
So the tip here is your initial price will really screw you if you get it wrong. And so obviously we're not going to give people the answer on their pricing strategy fully, but just is the advice just charged more or what would you recommend?

Jen Abel (00:23:08):
It is enterprise companies are very used to a land, when I say the first initial contract, somewhat between 75K and 150K, very used to that. In fact, that's probably where you want to start because you also want to understand where can you grow from this. Start contained, don't say 150K and sell the farm. Say, "It's 150K, here's who gets access, here's the value we're going to deliver and here's where we're going over time." You also want them to know, "Here's what we plan to do roughly in year two, year three."

(00:23:42):
I know it's hard to look that far out, but plant the seed with them in terms of where this is going. If you come in at $10,000, even if they want to bring you in and want to spend 100K with you, they have to be able to defend that and now they see a $10,000, it can get really messy, especially because a lot of them are using AI now to understand contracts. So they're going to quickly say, "Oh wait, you spent a thousand dollars with Lenny and now Lenny is asking you for a 100K. Great. Just help me understand why or defend it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:15):
I could totally see ChatGPT being like, "This is interesting."

Jen Abel (00:24:19):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:19):
It used to be 1K, now it's a 100K. What might be going on here?

Jen Abel (00:24:22):
Totally. The people don't realize how, again, know the game you're playing and don't be sloppy about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
So your advice here is really interesting. There's the land to expand. Expand is very important, but the landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point.

Jen Abel (00:24:45):
1,000%. That's exactly right. You said it better than I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:48):
And so you may see in theory if you land a 10K go to 100K, that's an amazing NRR, everyone's going to be really impressed. But you're saying people won't buy into that. It's going to feel absurd and wrong.

Jen Abel (00:25:00):
Unless it's defendable. All it needs to be is defendable. But who can really defend? That's very hard to defend a 10X. 10X jump, they're going to want to see 15X value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:11):
Let's talk about design partners.

Jen Abel (00:25:12):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
This is something most founders try to do. They find a few folks to work with, to help them build the thing. What's your advice on when to start finding design partners? How to find design partners, what a good relationship looks like?

Jen Abel (00:25:24):
Design partners are incredible. They're the hardest logos to upsell, meaning go from design partner to full rollout customer. So don't expect these people to be your million dollar pipeline. Expect these people to be the guide, to help you understand, maybe design partners could be a technology company in the Fortune 1,000.

(00:25:50):
So they're used to experimenting. They're used to technology, they're used to, they were once a startup, so they get it. Those make really good design partners. Most of the design partners that I've closed are usually technology based. They get it and they also are excited about advancing the org and also giving the team an ability to have that startup feel.

(00:26:12):
So if you're a large massive corporation like Stripe. Stripe doesn't get that startup vibe as much like that 50 person startup vibe, but this can be a gift to give them that lens and give them that voice and give them that excitement that they don't get as a larger company. But those are great types of logos to be early design partners because one, they want to make sure they continue to stay on the cutting edge, but two is they are, to try and build something without that guidance is really, really, really hard because they're not using it.

(00:26:54):
So you need that user feedback and you also need to tie that to the executive value. It's actually a lot, it's very hard to do, but if you can come out of it and upsell a design partner to a full rollout customer, such a huge win for the market for you, for your team, and also for your investors because it's the hardest customer to actually truly convert.

(00:27:23):
They've been it when it was messy, they usually got a low price point. But if you again frame it, say, "Listen, I would love for you to be a design partner. I want a little skin in the game to get you to point it. Here's where we want to go and you'll get a discount because you were in the beginning, but I'm setting the framing. Here's where we want to go with pricing. Here's where we are today. You'll always have 30% concession in perpetuity because you are there with us on day one."

(00:27:49):
So again, it's not about asking for $10,000 and then not expecting that design partner to upsell and keep it flat because there's no growth there. It's a flat. It's about getting that early design partner, set the framing, own the framing and let them know where you're going. Again, a $100,000 to these large logos if they want it, it's very easy for them to get it in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:11):
There's this really interesting underlying piece of advice of finding a company that pulls you in the direction that leads to success. A company that's kind of a visionary. There's the obvious companies that everyone is always trying to get these days, OpenAI and Anthropic and Stripe I think is one. And any advice for just picking the right early? What are signs that this is a company that will point you in the right direction?

Jen Abel (00:28:34):
I think they have to be part of a logo that is deemed startup-friendly or in that world, and then I think it's the person, is this person excited to give feedback? Does this person buy in to where we're going? Do they see this world differently like us? Are they in lockstep with the founder vision?

(00:28:58):
Are they excited to use a tool that's janky? Because it is janky in the beginning, but they know that where this can go can be incredible. So I think it's really about the person and making sure that they're aligned for what they're getting into, and I think a lot of salespeople oversell it. I think that's a common thing that happens and that leads to churn, that leads to frustration, that leads to sometimes just canceling the contract.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
They oversell the initial kind of design partners phase over the product.

Jen Abel (00:29:33):
They sell everything. Yeah, design partner, even full rollout, and it's so, so important to tell them, "Here's where we are today. Here's what we cannot do." Which is just as important. It builds trust. "Here's what we will allow you to do in the next six months. Do you want to be on this journey with us? And it's really ugly right now." Right? "Barely anything exists, but we would love your voice to be a part of it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:55):
One of the biggest fears I think founders have is having a company pull, basically build just for their use case and then it ends up not being used by a lot of people. And so how far do you go fixing their specific problems? Any advice on just how far to go with one company?

Jen Abel (00:30:10):
That is the founder's job. The founder's job is to have a clear vision and do not let anything delineate from that. It's important to take feedback in terms of what is the market's reality, but it is the founder, and this is why being a founder is so hard. It is the founder's job to interpret that because a lot of feedback you get is this is the old way, they're responding this way because it's the old way of working.

(00:30:37):
They want you to build this because that's how they're traditionally expecting to do that. It is not, "Here's where we're going, this is why we're not doing that. I hear you, but here's why we're not going to do that because we're going to completely change the way you do this." That is the founder's job.

(00:30:53):
And I think we did a bunch of design partnerships late last year and there was a lot of feedback given, a lot of feedback given, but the founder had such clarity with where he wanted to go that he was like 80% noise, 20% had I not asked this question, I wouldn't have gotten that gold in terms of where they are today. And it's that 80/20 rule where 80% of what they're going to tell you is probably going to be not related to where you want to go or based off of the old way, but that 20% of, "Oh, I did not think about it that way." That drives everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
Have you seen a design partner pull a company in the wrong direction? Just screw their path? Have you seen that or is that pretty rare?

Jen Abel (00:31:42):
No, I don't think it's that rare. We hear people complain about it all the time, but I think it's more of an excuse.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):
Coming back to this question of going after the enterprise versus SMBs. And again, early advice you gave is there's no, don't go in between. Either pick SMB small company, which I know you said there's a million ways to differentiate what this means, but I guess I think of employee numbers under some number over a thousand is maybe enterprise. Is that a good way to think about it just like-

Jen Abel (00:32:13):
Yeah, it depends. Are you selling per seats or are you selling based off of usage or are you selling off of, I think it also depends on the pricing model a little bit. I look at headcount too because it's just such an easy way to think about it because you can also gauge usage off that and a bunch of other things, but sometimes the small companies, I think we're going to see a lot more larger companies become smaller because of AI, not significantly smaller, but also high margins allow them to experiment more too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
That's such an interesting point you're making there that the way we designate enterprise versus SMB like may shift because number of employees may go down with AI.

Jen Abel (00:32:57):
Yeah. Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:59):
So interesting. So where I was going to go with this question is when people are deciding, I'm going to go enterprise versus I'm going to sell to startups, like YC companies are the typical example they sell to their own YC batches and you just broad advice of picking, "Okay, we go enterprise versus no, let's actually go startup."

Jen Abel (00:33:18):
I think it's about, and I read this somewhere and I wholeheartedly agree with it because I've seen it live. I think it's about what game does the founder best understand? Are they an incredible marketer and have some competitive edge for how they can win a massive audience?

(00:33:34):
I would say go SMB and marketing led or are they a bit more really understand how large corporations work and really excited to deliver on $100,000 plus type of opportunities or the value that they are building for is way more relatable to an enterprise versus a small business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
That is really interesting. I've never heard of it described that way. I think about linear, which started very startup-ey and my take is they did that because changing the way you work is really hard and their bet was like, "Let's start with companies and grow with them and over time that becomes the default." Any reaction to that?

Jen Abel (00:34:16):
I think that it sounds like that that's a great way to work because that's a technical tool, so that you need the right, also need to have the right infrastructure to sell. I think Slack, look, Slack and Microsoft Teams are still battling it out at the enterprise. I think it's also how you plug in and how you integrate and do they even have the right systems to support you? The thing with open AI is they didn't have to connect to anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:45):
Say more about that.

Jen Abel (00:34:46):
So the value, people were bringing their own use cases to it and it's not like they, well they can ingest and they built that, it's a brand new thing and they started I think, this is someone told me this, so this could be hearsay, but I believe that they were already speaking to CTOs even well before they released to help them explain where this is all going and get their buy-in.

(00:35:17):
And it's much easier to get into the enterprise when you're like, "We won't even touch your data, won't even touch your data. Just use it to solve problems and then we can build trust and then start to integrate and connect the pipes." But part of the challenges with selling in the enterprise, they're like, "All right, well let's connect all your data in the ..." "Whoa, that's extremely risky."

(00:35:41):
So you have to start small and low risk, which is like, "Hey, what is the subset of consumers that churned? Let's figure out how we could have made them happier, whatever it be." So that data is lower risk. So again, it's also understanding your market and understanding what their ability to experiment is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:03):
It's interesting this distinction between OpenAI right now, and Anthropic, I don't know if you've been seeing their growth, it feels like OpenAI is very consumer first and Anthropic is more and more winning on B2B. I saw this chart recently where they're overtaking OpenAI now on B2B. I don't know, any reaction there of just these two different approaches?

Jen Abel (00:36:23):
I don't because most enterprises I'm talking to mentioned Gemini.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:27):
Oh, interesting.

Jen Abel (00:36:30):
Or Microsoft Copilot. So I don't hear much about Anthropic to be honest. So that might be more of a small business startup-ey, I don't know or it's a different part of the organization that's using it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:45):
Yeah, that's a whole discussion or bundling right there of Slack and teams and then just Gemini just kind of coming in automatically. People don't have to adopt anything new.

Jen Abel (00:36:54):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:55):
There's something else that you talk about that I love that I don't think people talk much about, which is that enterprise sales is very creative.

Jen Abel (00:37:03):
Oh yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:37:06):
So I personally believe that small business sales is really a, I used to think it was more science than art. It was more figuring out what didn't work, running experiments, testing and validating, which I do believe, that's to get to foundations, where do we play? What do we want to do? Like that early, early, early zero to one.

(00:37:33):
From one to 10, I think it's more of an art, which is how do I take my learning and how do I package it up where I own the framing, I can speak to very specific alpha, I can vision cast and where I better understand the problem over time better than the market does. And it's all about deal crafting.

(00:38:00):
They just need to feel like the value they're getting out of it is way more than the cost. And it's sometimes about giving away things that don't really cost much to you, but are super expensive for them. For example, "Hey, we're selling X tool. We can build out Y specifically for you over the next year and integrate it because I know that you would've spent X number of dollars on engineering resources or you wouldn't have gotten in engineering head internally to do this, but we're just leave it to you. You got to give us a year to build it out."

(00:38:37):
Again, you're not letting them sidetrack you too much, you're kind of containing it. "We'll do that for you at no additional cost." That's huge value. Right? Or, "Hey, we're going to run an event and we want you at the forefront of it. We want you to be a speaker." Huge value. So it's like all of these additional things that add value beyond just the product but are all part of the product and the vision. Everyone keeps thinking the product is just what goes into their hand.

(00:39:07):
The product is pricing. The product is the opportunity, the framing and not letting them compare you to something else. And I know we talked that on our first call, which is as soon as you become a comparison, as soon as you become one of three that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost. It's all about differentiation and it's all about here's what you will be able to do tomorrow because of how we're going to serve you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):
So along those lines, it reminds me in our first chat you actually made this point that I've never heard anyone else make, which is that services are a really good way to start getting into the companies that were most founders here. Like, "No, don't do manual stuff for the company. Build a product that you can scale." Your advice is the opposite. Actually start with self-services. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:39:59):
Enterprise is the number one thing they buy services, they know how to do it's super easy, they do it all of the time. It's like the most consistent thing they do. It's their largest budget item, external resources, consultants, whatever.

(00:40:13):
If they have a very immature way of understanding the problem or they've never purchased technology to solve it to some extent, either one, you are doing something that's never been done before, which is rare in today's day and age, or they might just be laggards on the journey. So you have to decide is this someone you really want to be working with? And if so, selling them as service, even though the technology is powering it on the backend is the fastest way to get your foot in the door.

(00:40:50):
It's what they know how to buy. Now, the idea is to once you sell that surface, once you get that foot in the door, then it's to guide them towards the product. "Hey, you're spending so much here, why don't we get you to come in and leverage the tool that's been powering this the whole time and move this more into technology serving you versus the human."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:12):
Wow. I think this will blow a lot of people's minds.

Jen Abel (00:41:15):
Palantir, this Forward Deployed Engineer, that's exactly what they're doing. There's a lot of companies out, I'm sure OpenAI, and this is what someone told me they were in and talking to CTOs and helping them better understand how AI and their organization can better work together. And it was them coaching them, educating them, whether they did it for free or not, I don't know, but they got their foot in the door, they started to build trust and then it gets adopted.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:40):
This is the epitome of doing things that don't scale that advice we always hear this is like, "Okay, this is what that looks like. We will solve this problem for you. We are using software to do it." And then over time, "Oh, you could just do this yourself. It'll cost you less. You can scale this."

Jen Abel (00:41:54):
Yep, that's right. And they don't even need to know at first that software's doing it. That could be the magic part, which is like, "Guys, we literally, we are literally doing this with our technology."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:05):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows.

(00:42:20):

Coda.io/lenny.

(00:43:22):
There's a lot of talk these days about this idea forward deployed something volunteer was really famous for, just essentially an engineer sitting in your office solving problems with you basically as an employee. And then through that, they learn what software to build. Is that something you're seeing too?

Jen Abel (00:43:38):
Oh yeah, I think that a lot of companies, sorry, a lot of folks that serve the enterprise, they have a butt in a seat in their office. You look at these large consultancies like McKinsey, they're not in their headquarters, they're in their client's office all the time. And the other interesting thing and proof of this is how many people go to a Deloitte or Accenture and expect them to be a channel partner?

(00:44:02):
This is exactly what this is all about, which is they sell this service, they come in and then they introduce, "Hey, look at what this startup is doing over here. You might want to give them a shot. The problem with channel partnerships and why I don't believe in them is there are a hundred of you on this list and you're expecting them to sell it on your behalf."

(00:44:21):
Biggest no-no, they're not vision casters, they're not visionaries, they're consultants, but it goes all towards go. I remember startups saying, "Oh, I'm going to go win over Accenture and then have them disseminate me into their clients." And I'm like, as if that's a workable strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:41):
Okay. You know what might be helpful is, let me try to summarize some of the best pieces of advice you've shared so far. And this is specifically for folks trying to go from about a million ARR to about 10 million ARR. And then I want to ask you just what's most different about these two stages, but let me share this first. So advice one is go for tier one logos earlier than you think you should because they're early adopters, they can move fast, they can pull you in the right direction.

Jen Abel (00:45:09):
And they excite investors too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:11):
Yeah, for sure. And other leads are.

Jen Abel (00:45:14):
Yeah, and other talent, future employees. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:20):
So the counterintuitive insight here is you think they will move slow and be too busy, but they are actually the early adopters.

Jen Abel (00:45:27):
That's right. They have to maintain that number one spot. And also, all of the people that are in the number two, number three, number four spot, all want to do what number one is doing. So it's also pure referenceability too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:40):
And the point about them being the early adopters, the people that join the Stripes in OpenAIs and Anthropics are like they individually love technology and love the latest stuff. So as a human they're like, "Oh, this is cool."

Jen Abel (00:45:52):
That's exactly right. I'm just agreeing with myself, that's kind of funny. But yeah,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):
That's a good sign. So two is ideally try to price closer to about a 100K, like 75 to 150-ishK is what you said. Most enterprises are used to buying. So instead of starting or even sticking with 10K, 20K for too long, you need to make yourself go towards 75 to 150K.

Jen Abel (00:46:18):
That's right, yep. And if you were to sell a service, I know we're talking about selling services first, throw weight that over time, so maybe it's 10K a month. So they start to get used to what that pricing looks like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:28):
So this is a way to make it feel, this is like how you get to 75 to 150K is there's a service attached to it. It's not just, here's my SaaS product, we will solve this problem for you, or a person will be sitting there doing this for you.

Jen Abel (00:46:41):
Or no, it's the technology too. You can add the services. I always, well let me take that back. Whether the services is bundled into it or not, some people will unbundle it, other people will say the services is a part of it. But yeah, it nets out to 75 to 150K. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:57):
Okay. And you said that it's okay to start lower on ACVs and deals, but you need to push fast towards a 100K over a few months.

Jen Abel (00:47:05):
Yep, that's right. If you can get into an enterprise for 10K in a month, which is not doable, but if you could, and you could go from 10 K to 50 K in four months through an expansion strategy all game, that makes sense, but it's really rare and very hard to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):
And so there's two different paths there. One is land cheap and grow quickly. The other is move your ACV average up quickly. Seems like both, the latter is probably the more common strategy is just keep increasing prices.

Jen Abel (00:47:35):
Yeah, because the former you can get tripped up because they could say, "Okay, now give me an economical price for doing this for a hundred people." And then it all kind of evens out because now you're at the 100K deal anyway, but it's much, there's more room for error, which is why I say go in and try to land 100K.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:53):
By the way, in our first chat, we talked a lot about the procurement process, which is what trips a lot of people up and is really painful. And I vividly remember that conversation still. So if people are having issues getting through the sales process and procurement, a lot of good advice there.

Jen Abel (00:48:09):
And getting stuck in procurement is usually because you're not speaking to a senior enough person and they don't know how to navigate it, which is why I'm like that executive needs to be involved because as soon as the executive picks up a phone and tries to get a hold of their buying group, things move.

(00:48:27):
When people say, "Oh, I'm stuck in procurement." I'm like, "Oh, that could just be a qualification error and you never get out of it because you sold to someone too junior." So that's why the 100K is such a safe zone because even for 10K, you might have to go through procurement. So this is the surest way to make sure that you don't ... Listen, I've seen 10K take nine months to close.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):
No bueno.

Jen Abel (00:48:53):
Yeah, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):
Okay. Next piece of advice is this idea of vision casting instead of problem solving. So the advice here is instead of here's your problem, here's how our product solves it is here's how you will achieve alpha in the market by adopting the software. We talked about the example of cursor where if you adopt cursor, you're going to draw the 10X engineers that are joining other companies right now. This will give you a big advantage.

Jen Abel (00:49:16):
That's right. And yeah, it's pain versus opportunity, especially in the age of AI, and I know that we're moving into the next dimension. It's all about solving for a gap. It's seldom about solving for a very, very specific problem because people are trying to figure out what's our AI strategy? Where are we going to go with this? What is the world going to look like? I want to be a part of that new world. So it's a great time to be doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:42):
And then there's a bunch of advice you shared about design partners, of just how to select them. Your advice is definitely have design partners because they will help you build the right thing. But as a founder, you need to have a clear vision and sense of where you want to go and not just build everything they're asking you to build.

Jen Abel (00:50:00):
That's right, because important to say no. And that's all part of the framing, which is like here's, we want a little skin in the game. You set the price, but here's what we're marching towards in the next six to 12 months. Are we aligned there? If we deliver on what we say we're going to deliver, are we aligned there and do that kind of handshake?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):
Is there anything else that I missed that you think is really important for this stage?

Jen Abel (00:50:29):
So one to 10 is no longer the founder. Maybe the founder comes in very strategic points, but you need a really good enterprise salespeople. Taking someone from small business and expecting them to do enterprise sales, big no-no, it's a different game, right? Vibe like a different game.

(00:50:47):
You need to understand how corporations buy. You need to understand how executives think. You need to better understand simply just what the enterprise business model is all about and their ability to take on risk. People will bring in super junior enterprise sales reps and I'm like, "You're looking to sell to an executive and you have this person that's five years out of school with no corporate experience doing it, again, unless they have some extremely deep experience in the industry or are just a unicorn in terms of, wow, this person can sell ice to an Eskimo kind of thing."

(00:51:27):
A junior person converting an executive, again, if the founder is involved, maybe that's doable, but usually the founder can't be involved in every deal and you need people that can, I always say you need people that can cosplay a founder, which is selling the vision, getting them excited, running through a wall to get the deal done and getting creative on ... None of my deals look exactly the same, every deal looks different and that's okay because every organization has slightly different opportunities of where they want to go, and you have to kind of build towards that and the framing may change.

(00:52:14):
So it's this ability to adapt from what you're hearing and let that compound over time, but I always say, can this person cosplay the founder? I think that that's the best type of salesperson because it doesn't feel like sales. It's more of the art.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:30):
This is amazing advice. What is a common profile that you've seen be successful? What level of seniority? What kind of personality and any traits to look for?

Jen Abel (00:52:38):
Maybe a former founder if you can get that, because they're used to selling, they sold investors and they've sold employees. Two is someone with no sales experience, but has deep product experience or an engineer and can think about things in a unique way where the market is like, "Oh, this is so interesting."

(00:53:00):
Taking a typical salesperson then and putting them into a sales role almost always is where people get frustrated. The market, it feels salesy. The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy. And I know that it's very hard to hire a really good enterprise salesperson. The number of people that I've interviewed, I can count on my hand the ones that I get really, really excited by.

(00:53:29):
It's almost like coming across a great founder. It's not as common as everyone expects, and I think that that's true for engineering. I think that that's true for sales and I think a lot of people, sales is like, "Oh, just throw a body into it. The product will do the work."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:48):
Advice I often hear is don't hire a senior VP of salesperson from a bigger company. Do you agree with that? What's like to senior?

Jen Abel (00:53:55):
Yeah, so the bigger company thing, the brand was doing all of the work. The brand built the trust. You need this person to be able to build the trust and they're usually, the product is still so new. The product is the founder in the zero to one stage. The product is just starting to get a case study.

(00:54:15):
You probably have maybe a few references, but it's still very, very early days. You need the market to believe the salesperson and you need that market to know that they're trustworthy. A VP of sales at a large company, I would say, they're best suited for a large company because one to 10, you're running through walls.

(00:54:33):
You have to figure out, you're doing a lot of convincing, you're doing a lot of educating, you're doing a lot of creative deal crafting. A lot of owning the frame. It's not necessarily selling a product, it's selling that future value, which a VP of sales at a large companies, it's very different. It's a different game. It's kind of like the SMB and enterprise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):
It's interesting you said when you described the profile of a great hire here is you said they don't need to have done sales. If they have done sales, what's a number years or kind of what do you look for that tells you, "Okay, this is a good fit for the first hire."

Jen Abel (00:55:06):
I actually think it's less about experience and more about the person. Does this person make you feel good? Do you want to buy from this person? I think Jason, Jason Lemkin said that best. Would you want to buy from this person?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:15):
Can they sell you a pen?

Jen Abel (00:55:16):
The classic. Yeah, exactly. Do they mimic or mirror the market they're selling to? It's much easier to buy from someone that looks and feels like you than it does from somebody that's in a totally different realm. And also, an executive wants to talk to another senior person.

(00:55:41):
They don't want to talk to someone that just graduated from college and is selling them the new way of working. What do they know? So I think it's tricky. I would say someone with no sales experience makes it feel different and special, that's what I like about it. Someone with sales experience knows how to navigate and probably be qualified better, but it's almost like the blend of those two things.

(00:56:05):
And that's why I go back to cosplaying the founder, which is like, could this person close a future employee? Do they get excited about the problems they're solving internally and the vision that they get to sell to?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:19):
This actually was a reader question, listener question from Twitter. So Peter Dedenne asked, "How do you make this first salesperson as enthusiastic about the product as you? Is there something you could do? Is it more just they already are and you just leverage that?"

Jen Abel (00:56:36):
Incentives. Salespeople love to make money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:40):
Easy.

Jen Abel (00:56:42):
So if they know it's possible, if they know it's possible, you'll be shocked what people can get done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
If they see how much they could make. Amazing. I imagine there still also has to be an innate excitement about the product and the opportunity.

Jen Abel (00:56:58):
They have to believe in it. They have to believe in the founder, but incentives usually make the world go round, but yeah, is this person, are they asking the right questions to the founder? The best thing to do is have the founder join the first five calls. You know after five calls if this person has what it takes, and don't be afraid to fire. One in every two salespeople usually are fired. Yeah, it's a very high failure rate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:33):
Because you can tell pretty quickly how it's going.

Jen Abel (00:57:35):
You can tell, or the vision of the founders is just very wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
Speaking of incentives, do you have any quick advice on how to structure their comp? Just like how much they earn?

Jen Abel (00:57:45):
It's usually 50/50. So it's 50% OTE. So it's 50% base salary, 50% OTE.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:53):
And then how much of the sale do they typically get? Say the first sales hire.

Jen Abel (00:57:57):
It depends on the size of the deal, but in technology, it could be anywhere between eight and 12%. So rounds out around 10%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):
Okay. Awesome. When do you hire the first salesperson? Is it around the 1 million ARR mark usually?

Jen Abel (00:58:13):
Yeah, it's around that 1 million ARR, mark and I, and it's usually when you have your first seven to 10 customers and there's some pattern recognition around it that you can share with somebody else, there's some consistencies. Otherwise, it's just like that would be very hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):
Basically as a founder, you have to figure out how to sell enough times so that you can show someone, "Here's what's working."

Jen Abel (00:58:40):
And this is the common thing I hear, "Well, I'm a $10 million business. I'm in this small business space. You're $0 in enterprise." It's a zero to one right now in enterprise. It's a totally different game. It's a different value proposition, it's a different deal structuring, it's a different target market. It's a different risk tolerance. It's totally different. So don't be blindsided when-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):
It doesn't work.

Jen Abel (00:59:08):
... There's a lot of unlearning that needs to happen when you move into a new market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
So the advice here is make yourself sell up until around a million ARR, especially if you're trying to go enterprise selling to enterprises yourself as a founder, which is really hard. You have so much to do and you have to be selling this thing for a long time time.

Jen Abel (00:59:26):
Yep. And then try and find someone that you get excited by. It's funny, if you ask the founder, are you excited by your salesperson? I'm curious what the real answer is. It's like, "Well, it's a button to see it in. It was hard to hire, so."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):
Interesting. I remember, I think it was Jason's advice was to hire two people immediately.

Jen Abel (00:59:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
So you can compare them. Do you agree with that?

Jen Abel (00:59:48):
100%. Yeah, because of the 50% failure rate. I think that's exactly right. So yeah, even a tall order, go find two people that are good. But yeah, I think that that's right because one in two will fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:02):
Okay, let me ask you another reader question from Hang Huang. This is kind of in a different direction. So he says, "The biggest challenge is always cutting through the noise to get that initial meeting with the right decision maker. How do you even get their attention?"

Jen Abel (01:00:15):
It's the vision. What is the opportunity that you're selling? That if they are excited by that, they will take a call. I see it all the time, and don't give away the farm. Keep it to three sentences. And I know I said this on our first call, but say something counterintuitive, they could feel different. Make it feel like they can learn from you by taking a 15-minute call. You see the standards of like, "Oh, I came across your LinkedIn." And, "Are you looking to grow your business by 15%?" It's like, "What kind of statement is that?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):
And this is in the cold email they get about this pitch.

Jen Abel (01:00:56):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:56):
Awesome. So this is a good segue to another reader question from Hugo Alves, Co-Founder of Synthetic users. He asked, "What's the best advice for going from healthy inbound to targeted outbound?"

Jen Abel (01:01:07):
Healthy inbound usually is a marketing-led initiative. So that's a marketing game. It depends what deal value you're selling. Are you selling a $5,000 deal? It's got to be marketing-led to make the engine work. If you're selling $100,000 deal, you're doing outbound day one. So again, it breaks it into those. This is like that blending of the, I see a blending of that question. This is where you're doing small business marketing-led activities or are you a sales-led organization selling a $100,000 deal?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:40):
And the reason that's important, just in case it's not obvious, is you're not going to make money if you're selling. People are spending time closing deals that are making 10, 20K. Just the ROI on that won't work for your business model.

Jen Abel (01:01:51):
That's right. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:53):
Awesome. By the way, let me just say, Jen, this is an incredible conversation already. We've gone-

Jen Abel (01:01:57):
Oh this awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):
... Through so much. This is exactly what I was hoping to get through and we've gone through so much advice that I think is going to be so helpful to so many people. There's a few things that your partner, Justin also suggested I ask you about that I want to touch on. One is you have this question you ask founders a lot that opens up their mind. You ask them, "If you give your product away for free, would people even use this?" And every founder is like, "Of course." And then you ask, "A customer this?" And they're like, "Nah, we wouldn't use this." And that just blows their mind. Talk about just the power of that and how you recommend people approach this.

Jen Abel (01:02:33):
I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call, I'll say, "Honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year? Is it possible?" They'll give you the real answer and people are afraid to ask. But the other side is sort of if they're in it with you, they don't care about that question, right?

(01:03:01):
Can't ask that question on day one, but if you are, and we didn't talk about this, but maybe this is important. Every single enterprise deal I have done, the deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text. It's not on email anymore. It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately or I'm responding them to immediately because that builds so much trust.

(01:03:31):
If they know they can call on you, they're going to get you to pick up and they know that you're going to do everything humanly possible to make sure that this is successful. People will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, it's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible? And she's like, it's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it.

(01:04:00):
These are how enterprise deals gets done, it's relationships and it's this, and this is why I'm saying structuring the deal, make it feel like you went to bat for them and in often cases, you are going to bat for them and structure it in a way that makes sense for them. Everyone kind of just tries and pigeonhole. Pigeonholing and deal structuring consistency is important for a $10,000, sub-$10,000 deal. A $100,000 deal, it very commonly will look different every time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
April Dunford was on the podcast and she shared this really interesting insight that the reason people behave this way is the person at the company buying this thing, their ass is on the line Also, their reputation is on the line for this thing to work out. So they want it to go really well.

Jen Abel (01:04:45):
That's right. Again, they do this one in every three years, one in every two years, maybe one in every five years. Hell, I don't know. They don't do this every year. It's very rare. It's no one likes a new tool. No one. Not you, not me, unless it changes everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:05):
Yeah. Figma was a great example, that's Slack.

Jen Abel (01:05:08):
Everything you've touched

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:10):
Everything that worked out. You said that you asked these questions that people are afraid to ask. What are some other examples of questions you often ask that people are afraid to ask?

Jen Abel (01:05:20):
I will say, "Listen, this is $150,000 engagement. I will co-author it with you where we can make this a little bit bigger if you need something else. We can make it a little bit smaller in year one, but in year two it steps up. How do we get this done so when you go to bat, it's a win?" Sell them, do they take it to the wrong side and try and discount you? I've actually never seen that because at that point you have a relationship.

(01:05:51):
So co-authoring the pricing is so important because they need to know that they go to bat, they can say, "I got this out of them. If we get this deal done." So this is why when I say every deal looks the same, you're asking great questions because it's explaining why I meant by that, but this is another example of why every deal in the enterprise sort of looks somewhat different because a lot of it is co-authored. So again, if someone wants a slightly lower price, give it to them, but maybe them lock them in a little bit longer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):
There's another point that Justin makes that you've touched on a bit, but it's when your no, the way he phrased it is, Jen always talks about how no is the best answer to yes because no is data that you can use. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (01:06:38):
I am a qualification crazy person. I will not get in on another call with someone because on the first call it's either a yes or a no, there's no in between. Humans are, we're so different and we're so unpredictable, but we're also so predictable at the same time, right? It's very obvious if someone is excited and wants to do something, it is so obvious when someone is just trying to be nice.

(01:07:06):
So I will say to them on that call, "I'm sort of getting the vibe that this might not be a good fit or might not be good timing. Did I misinterpret that?" And they will usually say, "Yeah, you're right, it's probably not a good fit." And then immediately, "Great, I would love to stay in touch. You've just saved a relationship and you've just saved yourself a ton of time."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
And the implication here is just to your point, you're limited on time. You don't want to be spending time going down or rival that won't you anywhere.

Jen Abel (01:07:24):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:33):
I'm going to take a quick tangent on tools. What's the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling?

Jen Abel (01:07:39):
I don't use a tool because I believe in the manual and I'll explain why. Every single note I send is slightly different because I see a picture of them and I'm like, "Oh, I don't know if that's going to land." Or I'm like, "Oh, they actually might appreciate this. It's weird." Visual cues are so helpful. A picture is a visual cue, looking at how long they've been in the role, looking how long they've been at the company.

(01:08:05):
I use all of these little things and I seldom customize a note in a way that people expect which is that first customized sentence because AI does that, and everyone's doing that. So I go the opposite extreme, which is like remove it and I customize it with how I frame it or the subject line. So it's like if I'm talking to someone like a peer, I might say quick question like QQ.

(01:08:36):
If I'm talking to someone that has a bit more experience, I might write a little bit of a tighter note, not all lowercase. So it just depends on who you're speaking to. And again, this is why it's okay to spend a little bit of time on this because it's a hundred thousand dollars. It's actually a million dollars at the end of the day because a $100,000 deal if you play your cards right turns into a million dollar deal over three to five years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
I love how much you enjoy this. It's so fun to, so essentially what are you doing? You're sitting on LinkedIn finding folks to ping and then you cold email them one individually, manually.

Jen Abel (01:09:13):
It's so weird, Lenny, I have no process. I kind of just go with the vibe. I'll read an article about Tesla and I'm like, "Huh, they could be interested in this." Not because that article had anything to do with the problem I'm solving, but because I'm like, "This feels like a good Tesla day." It's hard to describe. It's a very emotional thing for me, and not to toot my own horn, obviously, but I've been successful in sales and the most successful sales people can't explain why they're good at it.

(01:09:51):
It just comes to them naturally. It's just like an emotional thing. It's like the world's best founders. How do you be a good founder? It's very, very hard to define. How do you become a good engineer? Very, very hard to define. So I don't believe in playbooks. I believe that there's a feel to it. I emailed a chief legal officer at a hedge fund once and he responded to me because I wrote to him on Saturday. I knew it was going to be busy. I made it one sentence and it was tweaked for him.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:29):
Do you feel like this is going to be the way as AI SDRs just kind of take over and everyone's getting billions of emails that feel AI-ish?

Jen Abel (01:10:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
So I guess maybe speak more there. Just like is the alpha essentially just become human? Don't automate? Should you think you should?

Jen Abel (01:10:49):
The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. So I'm like, "I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is trick-or-treating."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:04):
And this is effective for very large deal, which is what you need to be doing anyway because it takes a lot of time to do it this way.

Jen Abel (01:11:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:12):
Interesting. So you're not like sitting in Clay, you're not like Apollo, I don't have all those tools. You're just finding people yourself.

Jen Abel (01:11:19):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Do you start with a target prospect list at least just like, "Here's the companies that are the perfect fit for this and let's work through them."

Jen Abel (01:11:30):
It's all in my brain. I've been doing this for so long, I have in my brain, I'm like, these are my early adopters. These who I'm going to go to after I close those logos, they get excited by those logos. So it's just experience of you land a Walmart, you're going to go to the rest of the industry and say, "Hey, we're working with Walmart." Versus you go to some lower end enterprise company and they're like, "Wait, what do you do?" I can't even comprehend.

(01:12:02):
Also, the most strategic people, some of the most strategic executives are at these tier one logos. That's why they're tier one because they've got super smart, really capable folks. They also extract the best talent, the best talent likes to experiment and continue to improve. So it's like this compounding thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:20):
For someone that isn't Jen and has all this experience, say their founder, they're hit a million ARR. They're just like, "Okay, where do we find our customers?" Do you have any advice for just coming up with who we should go after? Should they be using these tools? Should they be hiring someone like a Jen? I know this is what you do for companies. So one crowd is go hire JJELLYFISH to help them through this.

Jen Abel (01:12:39):
Founder, the founder. I would say the founder, this is sort of in tune with them in a way. They just have to find it. It's so weird to say it's all, and I hate saying it because it's like a commonplace thing to say, but it's like there's this thing about flow and it's like some of these brands are in flow with you right now, right? You found this insight from somewhere. Who else? What's the next adjacent ring of people that would buy into that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:21):
And so what I'm hearing is just pay attention to what's happening, what companies are-

Jen Abel (01:13:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:25):
The news, what companies are doing interesting things, who are the kind of early adopters in the market.

Jen Abel (01:13:29):
If it was just a database list and it was just about figuring out the right messaging and then emailing folks, we would've known by that by now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:39):
That's so interesting. Okay, maybe one more question. This again is from Justin. He shares that when you hit resistance, you never argue, you reframe. If someone says, "We already have X solution, you'll agree and pivot and totally X is great for this thing, but here's what we can do."

Jen Abel (01:13:55):
This is why it's sell to the alpha. Hey, I know. Listen, that problem you just described, you're right. You have a tool for that. We're taking you much further upstream with value. This is the opportunity I want you guys to have access to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:08):
I love it, Jen. I've gone through everything I was hoping to get through. On the other hand, I feel like we could do another hour on all these things, I feel like we need to do.

Jen Abel (01:14:17):
We have three.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:19):
Yeah, we need round three on the next phase and all the things that people want to dig further into. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or share?

Jen Abel (01:14:30):
This stuff is really hard. It's very hard. Sales is also all about learning very, very quickly from the rejection. The rejection is good because it's a forced learning and you never want to go through that again, but you have to be, I don't like to use the word cringe. You can't be afraid to cringe is like bringing your AI recorder into a call, that's cringey, but sending 15 notes to people that you can deliver serious value to, don't be afraid, and don't be afraid to ask the hard questions. Be different.

(01:15:12):
The whole game is about, "Oh, this feels different. That's what people want access to." Yet everyone commoditizes themselves. They try and mimic what everyone, they try and mimic a forward deployed engineer. Just rename it. You don't have to use the same nomenclature. Everyone gets excited by the new because the new could be the next thing, the thing that changes it all. So that's why I'm always like, "Don't be better. Be different."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:40):
An amazing way to end it. With that, Jen, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Jen Abel (01:15:48):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:48):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Jen Abel (01:15:54):
I do Twitter accounts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):
Oh, Twitter accounts to follow? Oh, amazing.

Jen Abel (01:15:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:58):
Okay.

Jen Abel (01:16:00):
Lenny, the day I have time to read a book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:03):
Period.

Jen Abel (01:16:05):
Period. I would love to be reading books.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:10):
Cool. Twitter accounts to follow. Tell me.

Jen Abel (01:16:11):
Yeah. Look, obviously you, you produce some of the best content, truthfully,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:16):
Appreciate it.

Jen Abel (01:16:18):
You get into the minds of people that they're not even giving this insight on Twitter. Who else do I absolutely love? Jason Lemkin. So for sales, Jason Lemkin is awesome, awesome follow for sales, and also he had a great, great recording with you. So link to that because that was a great piece. I actually learned a ton from Matt. I love Gavin Baker. Super nuanced takes. Takes a lot of obvious statements, but shares a lot of the non-obvious insight. He's great. Jason Cohen, have you ever had Jason Cohen on the cast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):
Jason Cohen, a Smart Bear Jason Cohen?

Jen Abel (01:17:00):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:00):
He's coming on the podcast at the end of the year or something.

Jen Abel (01:17:05):
Oh, that's awesome. What a great plug for him right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):
Yes.

Jen Abel (01:17:08):
Yeah, those three would be great. I know they're all men, but.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
Great tips.

Jen Abel (01:17:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:12):
Next question, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed? I know you said you have time to read.

Jen Abel (01:17:18):
This is going to be embarrassing, Baywatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:22):
Baywatch.

Jen Abel (01:17:22):
Yeah. Baywatch channel. It's just so Numby, and it's like '90s classic. Baywatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:30):
Wow, I've never heard that one before. So this is original Baywatch with?

Jen Abel (01:17:34):
This is original Hasselhoff. David Hasselhoff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):
Yeah, Pamela Anderson.

Jen Abel (01:17:39):
Yasmine Bleeth. Pamela Anderson, the original cast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:41):
Amazing.

Jen Abel (01:17:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):
Okay. Deep cut. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Jen Abel (01:17:47):
So the number one thing for me right now is an app called Playground, which is the pictures of my toddler that they upload into the preschool so I can get the daily updates on what's going on in preschool when he's not home.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):
Amazing. I need that. We get emails and Google Photos. I would really love that.

Jen Abel (01:18:09):
Yeah, there was another one called ClassDojo. There's a few of them, but Playground is the one that this preschool's on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
Love ClassDojo. I'm a small investor.

Jen Abel (01:18:17):
Are you really?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:18):
I am.

Jen Abel (01:18:18):
Oh, that's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):
How about that? Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to find useful in work or in life?

Jen Abel (01:18:26):
Yeah, be direct. Cut the fluff. Give me the bullet, not the paragraph.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):
Final question. I was told that by Justin that you've never read a sales book. You've just learned to do this. If you were to read a sales book, if there was someone else out there that you look up to, learn from, is there anyone else out there in the world of sales that you most respect?

Jen Abel (01:18:51):
I think Jason Lemkin has the strongest understanding of sales. His content is unbelievable. He speaks about it clearly and cleanly, I would say. And as I mentioned, unbelievable Twitter follow. I'm a big fan of his.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):
Awesome.

Jen Abel (01:19:06):
I've actually learned a lot from him too. The 50/50 thing or a higher two salespeople, he's spot on. Failure rate is actually probably higher than 50%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:15):
I love that guy. And he's so AI-forward these days. He's just building. He almost took down Replit with his complaints. It was a whole new cycle of how Replit-

Jen Abel (01:19:24):
He should interact. Sometimes he says things that are harsh, but you're like, "He's not wrong."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:31):
Love it. I got to get him back on the podcast.

Jen Abel (01:19:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:33):
Jen, this was incredible. This was everything I wanted to be. I feel like we just leveled up all the founders that have listened to this in their ability to close. We're going to just create all the economic value and a lot of happy VCs from all the sales that will be closed as a result of the advice you shared. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to either work with you or follow you online? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jen Abel (01:19:54):
Twitter. Every new learning or mishap, I put red on Twitter, so it's like my personal diary and super responsive on Twitter DM.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:06):
What's your Twitter handle? Twitter handle.

Jen Abel (01:20:08):
It's double J, So J-J-E-N_A-B-E-L.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:15):
You did not make that easy for people to find you, but we-

Jen Abel (01:20:17):
Yeah, I know, I know, I know I didn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:20):
And the J is for JJELLYFISH, is that where the extra J is for?

Jen Abel (01:20:23):
Yeah, the double Js. Then also, well, someone else had the handle, so I was like, "I need my name."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Got it. By the way, just tell people what JJELLYFISH is in case that might be helpful to them.

Jen Abel (01:20:30):
Yeah, so it's a consultancy that helps folks in the zero to one stage, and now I'm at general manager of enterprise at State Affairs, which is basically giving citizens and corporations an inside peek into what's actually going on inside the state capitol building. State policy is way more impact than on you, than federal policy. Federal policy is written more about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:54):
Incredible. I've only recently learned that that's what you're doing these days, and that is super impactful and important, so thank you for your work there.

Jen Abel (01:21:02):
Even democracy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:04):
No big deal. Jen, thank you so much for being here.

Jen Abel (01:21:06):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was a blast.

# Moving fast and navigating uncertainty | Jeremy Henrickson (Rippling, Coinbase)

## Transcript

Jeremy Henrickson (00:00:00):
It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, "Hey, you take that hill over there. You guys do this over here." When in fact, where you really learn where the challenges are, or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated. And so I try to do that as often as I can, and I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise.

Lenny (00:00:32):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, for interview world-class product leaders and growth experts, to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jeremy Henrickson. Jeremy is senior vice president of product at Rippling, where he leads the product and design teams. Previously, he was chief product officer at Coinbase where he oversaw 10 x growth of the product and engineering organizations and helped scale Coinbase during one of the craziest times in the crypto markets. In our conversation, Jeremy shares his lessons about maintaining velocity at scale, creating a culture of fast decision-making, the importance of product leaders going deep on a problem, and becoming world experts at their domain. What to look for in product managers you're interviewing, why relying on frameworks can be so detrimental to your success, why you may want to avoid MVPs and instead designed for the most complex use cases first, and tons more. Enjoy this episode with Jeremy Henrickson after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:27):

Jeremy Henrickson (00:03:30):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:32):
So I've heard nothing but amazing things about you and I'm excited to learn from what you've learned from your experience at Rippling, at Coinbase, and all of the products and teams that you've built. And so thank you again for being here.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:03:45):
Yeah, super happy to be here.

Lenny (00:03:46):
So I want to start with your time at Coinbase where you were chief product officer and you were chief product officer during maybe the craziest time in the crypto markets. It was I think 2016, 2018 when I was looking at the Bitcoin prices and it was like it went from a $1000 to $20,000 I think in a matter of months. So I'm curious, what was that experience like, and in particular, what was like leading a product team through that experience?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:04:11):
The strongest memories for me are during 2017 where crypto, which had kind of been at its nadir in early 2016 and slowly started climbing out, just kind of took off and became a real thing in the public consciousness. And Coinbase, which at the time had an exchange just like on-ramp and off-ramp from fiat to crypto and back experienced over the course of 2017 40 x growth in usage.

Lenny (00:04:39):
That's like a dream come true for a lot of people.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:04:42):
No, I mean it was both a dream and a nightmare and I was incredibly lucky to be working on it with a team of people that I could really trust and could stand shoulder-to-shoulder within the trenches. And it was a lot of learning about how you can rapidly scale systems over time and people like to trade crypto on Saturday mornings, so a lot of Saturday mornings just some new thing would break on the edges of the system and we need to get in there and work on it. And so it was just a lot of really incredible lessons about who you choose to work with and focus and making sure you have the right people in the room at the right time.

Lenny (00:05:25):
Okay. So let's actually unpack a couple of those. So focus is really interesting and something people always talk about, but hard to actually do. I guess how did you keep the team focused? I imagine just everyone's getting rich all over the place in crypto.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:05:39):
Huh.

Lenny (00:05:39):
Things are breaking all the time, like how did you maintain focus on your team?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:05:43):
Well, the first thing is you don't talk about people getting rich. It's a very technical, you talk about like its customers, it's their money, and number one, it had to be secure. So there's a guy named Philip Barton, a friend of mine now, and he is just this amazing security leader at Coinbase, and he was able to always put these decisions that we were making extremely quickly in context and say, "Look, these are the kinds of decisions we can make and still have it be secure no matter how fast we need to move." And so security was always the number one thing. And then the second thing is focusing on both the kind of immediate nature of the issue. Hey, site is down or whatever, and resolving that, but also trying to set those in a context of where we need to go over the next six months. What are we actually shooting for? What do we believe the volumes are going to be? What's it going to take to have everything from a user experience to the deep back end of the product that what would actually work for them?

Lenny (00:06:41):
What was maybe the biggest challenge as a product leader trying to keep people focused and everything on the rails as things were going 40 x?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:06:50):
I think the biggest challenge was that in crypto there's just so much uncertainty in general, simple questions like, is Ethereum going to be a thing, are the subject of debate. And no one actually at the time had an answer to that question. Lots of really strong opinions and so you have to be able to have those debates because lots is going on, but then you have to be able to come out of those conversations with a clear kind of company point of view that you're all shooting toward. And while there may still be differing points of views and debates that happen on the margins, you go full speed toward this answer until you decide to go full speed toward a different answer. And I thought we were pretty successful at that at Coinbase and it wasn't always easy.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Maybe just a last question there.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:07:34):
Sure.

Lenny (00:07:34):
Living through a time like that, a lot of people are going through these periods of just intense work and it's like, holy moly, this isn't crazy stressful working, like incredibly long hours, but then you look back at those times, and end up being some most important meaningful periods of your career.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:07:50):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:07:52):
I guess one is that, is that your experience too? And then two, I guess is there any advice for someone that's maybe going through something like that of just here's maybe the silver lining of being in a period like that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:08:03):
So it's hard, right? It wasn't always easy. I had a new daughter who had been born just a few months earlier, really tough to balance those things, but I've always loved the rate of learning. And so it is those experiences I feel that have most sort of accelerated my own personal growth and personal learnings because it's in the crucible of things being hard. And so I think when people are going through those times, it's nice to take a step back and talk with friends or whatever about what's really going on and setting it in the context of, hey, three, four or five years now from now when we look back on this, you realize, wow. A, we did something amazing with that time. And B, we learned a lot and we were able to take that with us into whatever we were doing next after that.

Lenny (00:08:52):
Before our chat, I'd asked you what people ask you for advice most around, and you said that people often ask you for advice on how to maintain velocity at scale, which is something every founder and product leader is always striving to do. And so what have you learned and what do you tell people about maintaining and maybe even improving velocity as you scale?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:09:12):
I think there's a lot of different answers here, and I think a lot of them are very specific to the nature of the business that someone's in, like different businesses can maintain velocity in different ways. I think there's kind of a universal truth that you want small teams with clear missions. Right? If there's 300 people trying to work on one thing, the just sheer communication challenges, Dunbar's number, all of those things come into play and it's really, really hard to act quickly. And so having smaller groups of people breaking down what is always a very, very large problem into sufficiently small bits that small groups can attack wholeheartedly and minimize horizontal communication, I think is the first thing. I think the second thing is that to the extent it's like a technology problem. The more you can bake into a clear platform, it reduces the decision-making complexity for everyone who's working on the domain part of the problem.

(00:10:09):
And so a clear like a platform with a clear interface [inaudible 00:10:12] easy to use in all the ways that both engineers and product people want it to be easy to use, simplifies the space in which people have to think about these problems. And that's not always easy. Platforms are not, you can't just write a platform and hope it's going to work for the products. It's very much an iterative thing, but the more one can invest in that and have the right kinds of people who are capable of doing that sort of both systems thinking and product thinking simultaneously, I think is really important. The third thing, just from a leadership point of view is diving deep. Right? It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, "Hey, you take that hill over there, you guys do this over here." When in fact where you really learn where the challenges are or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated.

(00:11:05):
And so I try to do that as often as I can. And I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise. And I think the last thing is it's just making sure that teams have the right distribution of experience and seniority. Sometimes you get a team started and the team is perhaps doing something that's zero-to-one and they're amazing at all this zero-to-one stuff.

(00:11:28):
And then two or three years later, those same people are trying to scale the product to millions of people and it turns out that A, they don't like that part of the job as much, and B, maybe they're not as good at it. So I think you [inaudible 00:11:40] constantly look at the team and make sure that a people are doing things that they love and if they're not like, Hey, we've tried this other thing instead and recalibrate the team and make sure the right kind of skill sets are there. And I found if you do all of those things and then have product leadership where we're saying this is what we need to do and very, very clear and precise on what needs to be done, then you can usually actually even accelerate over time because you bake more into this platform, it allows your engineers to do more with less, and that's always pretty amazing.

Lenny (00:12:07):
Okay, let me dig into a couple of these. These are really great.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:12:10):
[inaudible 00:12:10] please.

Lenny (00:12:12):
So with the small teams with clear missions, is there an example of that at Rippling or Coinbase where that was a really good example of this being true?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:12:20):
One example is maybe three years ago when I was just starting at the company, we decided that we needed to build a time and attendance product, lots of market demand for us and that we hadn't built it yet, something that many customers need. And so there were a bunch of ways we could have chosen to do that, but the way we did it was to say, look, let's find one engineer, really talented systems engineer who's actually capable of doing kind of product thinking and have Parker, CEO also spend time on it. And you start there and Sachit brought a few people on with him.

(00:12:56):
And those four people over the course of maybe nine months or so, built a time and attendance product. It was the only thing they were doing. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with our payroll product except to the extent they had to integrate with them a little bit. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with the benefits team or our IT products. They were monomaniacally focused on this one thing and then identifying the places where yes, you, there's connectivity to the rest of the suite, and that allowed them to move extremely quickly.

Lenny (00:13:24):
How much of that was Parker being on the team, helping them unblock everything versus being very small and focused?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:13:30):
I think it was mostly small and focused. Obviously, Parker can do things and unblock them in the way that only a CEO can and that helps. But the thing is at Rippling, like we've now replicated that a dozen times. That's our model for starting new things. And so it can't just be him unblocking things, though he does unblock things. It's more that this pattern of having these small groups be able to do things and then being able to have go to those people, whether you're Parker or somebody else in the company, and be able to say, Hey, how are things going? Or are we working on the right things? Or let's see the latest designs for that thing and comment on it.

(00:14:05):
All of those things can happen just at a much greater tempo than if you're trying to go three layers down into the org and do things. I think that's the other, maybe the key point here that everyone is exposed senior leadership, yes, we have a management structure because you have to, but that management structure does not interfere with the ability of anyone anywhere in the organization to look at what's actually happening. And that happens very directly.

Lenny (00:14:29):
So let's talk about that model you just described. So what is that model? So this is how you approach new products, and I know within Rippling there's many, many products and features we're going to talk about this. And you're saying that you have kind of an approach to adding a new business unit essentially, or a new product feature.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:14:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:43):
What is that model roughly?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:14:45):
Yeah, so the model's quite simple. In the vast majority of cases, we realize we need to build something and we have the one-page view of what that is. And usually, we're lucky enough that the things we're building sort of exist in some form in the industry today, not in the differentiated way that we can build it, but time and attendance is an example. That's a well-known thing in the industry. There's whole companies that do only that, right? So we start there, we find a single engineer who is extremely entrepreneurial, understands what it means to operate at tempo, understands what it means to make decisions with low information, understands how to work very, very quickly with a design partner.

(00:15:22):
So we have a design partner and we say, "Look, come into Rippling, spend a few months getting to know the platform first of all. So go work on this other team, understand what's easy for them, what's hard for them, how the platform works, how other products have been built on top of this. Go talk with other people who founded products here and understand what their experience is so that you can learn from and iterate on it, get an opinion about your product, and then start building it."

(00:15:48):
And during this intervening time, they're also recruiting a team of usually 2, 3, 4 other engineers who kind of have that same zero-to-one mentality and they start building. And usually over the course of six to nine months, we can get a product from a blank sheet of paper to something that is launched or at least that we're using internally when we dogfood our stuff really heavily. And then it grows from there. And then sometimes when you launch one of these products, you get close to launch, you realize, hey, actually a team of five or six people can handle this product ad nauseam. Sometimes you have to bump it up. It's like, okay, this thing's about to go to production, there's all these other things to do, the team needs now needs to go from 4 to 15 or something like that. Really depends on the product, but that's the general life cycle and then you keep growing and scaling it.

Lenny (00:16:34):
That is fascinating. So just so I understand, you find a founder type to take the lead on a new idea and do you recruit them internally or you sometimes find them externally just to focus on this product?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):
Both.

Lenny (00:16:34):
Interesting.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):
Both.

Lenny (00:16:46):
Okay. And then you find a design partner for them to work with to figure out what exactly needs to be built. And is it idea pick one design partner or you try to encourage a few?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:57):
Usually, it's one. So there's a designer, so we have a design-

Lenny (00:17:00):
Oh, design partner, meaning a designer, not a company that is like their partner in design.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:17:06):
Oh, no, no, no. Literally, somebody who knows Rippling's products, knows our component library, knows all of that stuff and is skilled and doing UX and interaction and visual design.

Lenny (00:17:19):
Got it. Okay, design. Okay, cool. And then they basically with maybe a couple engineers, just that's the team that initiates a new product line and then launches it, and then as it scales, it maybe grows the team, maybe not.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:17:33):
Yep, that's right. And it's pretty ad hoc, but every couple of weeks or something like that, they're meeting with me or with Parker or whichever one of us is the DRI on it and giving feedback on the designs, having a critical life or like "Oh man, if I were using this as a admin, a small company or an admin at a large company, how would I feel about this? Would this interface work for me?" And so we were pressure testing it throughout that cycle and trying to get the balance of speed and comprehensiveness, right.

Lenny (00:18:03):
This reminds me you're also, I hear not a big fan of MVPs that you building products to further point. Is that true? And then if so, how do you think about the initial version of a product?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:18:16):
First of all, I don't want to knock on MVPs. I think MVPs have their place extremely useful, particularly if you're literally the zero-to-one company that's never done anything before and you don't have clear market validation. I think in our case specifically for Rippling, a minimum viable product would do a disservice to both our customers and to the very team that was building it. And the reason I believe that is that when you design a minimum viable product, you're optimizing for speed. And in that set of optimizations, you are minimizing the deeper product thinking about what can fully differentiate our product based on not only existing kind of capabilities within our products and platform, but based on what it ought to do in the future.

(00:19:03):
And so it sort of limits product creativity, but worse, it leads to building the wrong thing technically, right? So if you're only thinking through the simple cases and you're an engineer and no one's pushing you on saying, "Wait, what about that healthcare hospital administration case where it's mission-critical life," then you're going to make a different set of as architectural assumptions, and then you're going to build on those and you're going to build on those for six months, nine months a year, and you'll have dozens or 100s of assumptions built on top of those.

(00:19:38):
And it's extremely difficult to unwind those decisions once you've built them into the product. And therefore we believe very deeply it's like, sure, understand those simple cases. Understand if you're a two-person company, you don't need all of these other things. And what is the product going to look like for you to approach it but also understand what it would mean to have 10,000 people globally around the world with this ridiculously hard use case? What's the model that would support that? And let's make sure that as we're doing the technical and product design for this thing, that it accommodates that view, even if we're not going to support it in the first version, even if we make the product decision to say, "Look, we actually don't need to handle that case right now." You still build the product in a way that's not going to prevent you from getting there in the future. And does that take a little more time? Sure, yeah. But does it save you time in the long run? Absolutely. Right. And so that's our approach.

Lenny (00:20:39):
Is there an example that comes to mind of a product you build at Rippling or Coinbase of just, it could have been this really simple MVP and then ended up being like, no, we did the right thing by building it further along the spectrum.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:20:49):
Yeah. So I think a great example of this at Rippling is our global payroll product. We could have said, "Hey, look, we just need to support this one country. We need to support, whatever, the UK," let's say. So we're going to copy all of our US stuff, just replicate it and change all the things to be UK-like. That would've been the fastest thing to do to dramatically oversimplify, but that's not what we did. What we did is we said, look, we need to launch a six countries and these are six super different countries that we want to look at. And they're going to have different requirements from an HRIS standpoint, from an employer of record standpoint, from how you pay global contractors, from how payroll works, and we're going to make a system that works for those countries. And there's lots of downstream implications for that.

(00:21:39):
But what it means is that now our global payroll system, adding a country is, it's not easy, but it's a lot easier than it would've been if you had to continue to stamp out and replicate and then of course maintain all of these things that have very little underlying connectivity. And instead, what we have is 80% of the system is baked into our global payroll platform, and then the 20% is country-specific. And most of that specificity can be handled not by engineers who are very, very expensive to change things that are local specific, but instead can be configured by somebody that's in compliance, by somebody that's in legal that needs to get the right documents into the system. And all of that stuff can be handled by the system, which allows us to move much faster sort of going forward.

Lenny (00:22:27):
I've heard you describe this kind of idea as you encourage teams to design for the most complex use case first.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:22:27):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:32):
Is that kind of the instruction you give these teams?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:22:35):
100%, many times. And so it's one of these things that until you're here, it's a really difficult thing to kind of grok because A, it's so counterculture to what the background that most people have come from. It's like, no, no, no, don't think about all those things. Just zoom in on this one case, use it as a wedge, and then grow from there. And this is one of the reasons that we have people, especially new people in these kind of founding roles, come in and spend a few months just absorbing the culture to really learn these lessons. And it's one reason that we're extremely high touch with kind of new products in their infancy to make sure that we just don't fall into that trap, right? Especially because simultaneously with doing this, we're like, "Hey, but we need to ship this as fast as possible." Right? And so you want to get the balance of those two things right.

Lenny (00:23:17):
So when I think about Rippling, I think of you got the culture is to do things the hard way and the right way. And an element of that is there's this concept that I've heard that Rippling is this compound startup? What does that term mean? And then how does that approach impact the way you build product and organize teams and all the things you were just talking about of MVPs and build new products?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:23:40):
The idea of a compound startup for us is that we're basically a lot of businesses that all work together. If you think about the products we offer, we have payroll, well, there's entire companies built just on payroll, insurance, and benefits, entire companies. That's our entire life. In fact, a fragment of benefits is the entire life cycle of a whole company. Our IT products, device management, and identity management, time and attendance, each of these things are industries into themselves with multi-billion dollar companies serving each of them. The insight Parker had before he founded the company was actually the result you get that when you have that is that there's all this data that gets replicated and copied and as impossible to keep in sync everywhere. The right answer is to have a single system of record, one place, one database where all of that information is resident so that each of these downstream systems can always have the right data at the right time.

(00:24:34):
And then you can build on top of that things like workflow and reporting and analytics and permissioning and all these kinds of underlying capabilities. So the idea of a compound startup is all of these different businesses benefit from being built on top of one platform. The activation energy for that is extremely high. So before my time at the company, Parker, Prasanna, the technical founder, and others, built all of the first versions of all these products and it was a minor miracle, they were able to do that. But having done it, we then had that platform and we could continue to build new verticals and new startups on top of that foundation.

Lenny (00:25:16):
This touches on something that comes up a number of times in this podcast, which is the importance of differentiation. And it feels like this is the differentiator for Rippling. It's not going to be just a better one of these vertical solutions like the main differentiators, we're going to do it all and everything's going to be so much better because it's all in one platform. Is that kind of where the original idea came from or is there a different way to think about that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:25:38):
Yeah, I think that's right. So I mean, the fundamental contention is having a single system of record is better for many, many, many reasons, right? The most simple of which is there's a single source of truth and all of these other products can rely on it. But also, unless you start without assumption of everything being in a single system of record, there's a bunch of other things you can't do. You can't build out a, I don't know, a permissioning system that looks at the various attributes across all of these products. You now suddenly have to do an integration and each of these products talks different languages. You can't do simple things, build a product and say, who is this person's manager? Most products, you can't do that. Most products you find some system of truth, export everybody's name and email address and a spreadsheet, have another email address or another name, maybe an employee ID of who that person reports to and upload that to another system, which by the way is immediately out of date because organizational structures change all the time.

(00:26:35):
Whereas with Rippling, it's always correct. We are the system of record. So all of our products, they're like, "Hey, who's that person's manager." And the system immediately knows. And that's a very, very simple example of something that you can only do if you start with solve it to come back to an earlier point, like solve the most complex use case first, solve the fact that this data all needs to be in the same place. And so our ability to differentiate boils down to that one fundamental decision, which just allows us to do things that are literally impossible for any other company to do.

Lenny (00:27:09):
What would you say is one of the most unique things about Ripplings culture that maybe you haven't mentioned yet?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:27:15):
I would say it's fundamental, speed of execution. I think in speed of decision-making. It's the thing that is probably the hardest to explain to people before they're here. It's hard to understand until you experience it. It's like let's not schedule a meeting for next week or tomorrow or later today. We're in the middle of a meeting, we need to make a decision. Let's either make the decision or if we can't, let's Slack call in the person that we need in order to make that decision. And we'll be done with the decision today.

(00:27:44):
And like sure there are irreversible decisions you can't make that way, but for the most part, we really value the tempo of decision-making and the speed of response. And no company I've been at any scale, 5 people, 5,000 people, has ever operated at the tempo this one does. And I think that our ability to continue to operate at that tempo, which is partly due to the fact that we are a compound startup and have these small teams independently operating teams and all the rest of that is a really differentiating thing about the culture of the company.

Lenny (00:28:14):
I'm reading Kevin Kelly's new book where I don't know if you've seen his new book. It's all these little tidbits of advice and one of his pieces of advice is that usually the best time to do something is right now. And that feels like that resonates with the way you all think. I'm curious just how you create that culture and ability to make decisions fast. Is it purely top-down founder, this is how they behave, or is there something else that you found as effective to create this culture of moving fast, making decisions really quickly?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:28:43):
Obviously, a huge piece of this is Parker himself. It's an attribute of his personality, he likes making decisions quickly, and it's also a deliberate strategic decision on his part to have a company that makes decisions quickly. And so he models this constantly, right, in Slack, in conversations in person, and in every way possible. And there's an expectation throughout the company. If you kind of look at our leadership principles, this ability to make decisions quickly is something that kind of everybody promulgates. But also I think there's a number of things we've done to bake it in the way that we even do say quarterly planning. And the fact that there's this timeline for decision-making that doesn't leave a lot of room in the way that we expect people to know their domains, especially in product, right?

(00:29:29):
In product, you don't own little feature, you own your product and you're expected to be the world's foremost expert in it. And if you are, what that means is instead of having to come back to people three days later with an answer, just off the top of your head, you can be like, "Yes, this is what I think I should do about that or give me 30 minutes, look something up and I can tell you what we need to do about that." And so all of those things in combination just yield an environment in which these decisions happen very quickly.

Lenny (00:29:55):
You talked about quarterly planning and you're saying that there's like, here's the timelines we need to make decisions on these dates, and there's a culture of just we stay firm to that. And if you don't, then we're going to move on.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:30:06):
That's right. And it's shocking to people when we actually move on, right, that haven't been here yet. It's like, no, no, that date passed. You don't get to retroactively make everybody react to the fact that you didn't operate quickly enough, right? And it's not a hostile thing, it's just a, people just have to get used to. It's a deep cultural principle. And the fact that everyone stands behind it just means it's gets reinforced on its own, out of its own gravity.

Lenny (00:30:34):
Do you have internal values that you've kind of outlined that are a part of this? Or is that not something that you find super valuable?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:30:42):
No, actually I find them quite valuable. And actually our COO, Matt MacInnis, who joined the company about a year before I did, he has been the one to really drive this and you go to, I can't remember this specific URL, but on Rippling there's a search Rippling leadership principles. There they are. And they are really true to the culture of the company. The way we came up with them was to us a couple years ago, to introspect and to what actually made people successful at the company? Like who's successful, why are they successful? Why do they enjoy being here? Or alternatively the opposite, like why people not worked out, why do some people not enjoy it here? And those are the things that are differentiating and those are the things that we wrote down.

Lenny (00:31:23):

Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. For someone listening that's like, we need to move faster. And everyone always feels this, we need to move faster, we make decisions faster. What piece of advice would you give someone for helping them do this at their company?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:32:27):
I think it's really context-dependent, but I think it starts with whoever is in the role of making the top-level product decisions of them being one extremely clear about what those priorities are and more importantly, extremely clear about what all the priorities aren't. Right? There are so many things that could be important or people can make the case for being important or whatever that are fundamentally distracting from the core mission of getting something done.

(00:32:55):
But secondly, for that person to go all the way to ground on it, we have one of the leadership principles is go and see. Right? So to look at the thing and then walk all the way to ground and talk with the engineer who's writing the code on the thing. Because inevitably this top-level communication is insufficient to get to the detail of what matters and doesn't matter. And you don't have to do that everywhere, but if you do it in enough places, what it does is it creates a clear expectation of that kind of clarity across the board and forces everyone to up their game a little bit and just helps people understand what the expectation is. Right? And I think in the absence of those sort of clear expectations, it's difficult for people to perform at their best. Right? And so we try to do that pretty frequently.

Lenny (00:33:43):
Okay. I definitely want to spend more time on this, but before we get there, so go and see. I love that. And that actually has come up recently on a number of podcasts, just the importance of people continuing to ask questions and going to the end of what's possible. Recent story was IO talking about building the cash card and going to the warehouse and watching the printings of the cards and things like that.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:34:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:34:04):
I guess first of all, do you have a sense of where that came from and why that ended up being so important to y'all? And then two is there an example of you doing that or someone you've seen do that and that leading to something really important?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:34:16):
In the early days of our global efforts, when we were first trying to figure out what global payroll was, it was really tempting to say, "Oh, well we're going to go into the UK and that's going to be relatively similar to what we're doing in the US." But our kind of head of payroll went in and said, actually, here are the ways in which we knew it was going to be different, but here are the ways in which we didn't anticipate that it was going to be different, which made us realize that we had to completely alter our approach for how we think about learning about each of these countries and going into them and having a fulsome experience.

(00:34:50):
And that then backs into things like, well, every country does tax filings, every country does them slightly differently, but how are we going to build a tax filing system that's going to allow us to satisfy the needs of every country in which we're going to run payroll? And it was only through that very early on deep look at how one country was actually operating and then doing the same thing with the next country that we were able to set in motion, all of those things. It's not like we knew all the answers at that point, but it allowed us at a much earlier stage to put in motion a bunch of stuff that we need to do that then got subsequently much more clarified and much more precise over time.

Lenny (00:35:30):
And so the leader of that team basically just went and studied the tax laws of each-

Jeremy Henrickson (00:35:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:35:36):
... country.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:35:36):
That's right, went all the way to ground. It's like, okay, let's go and open up the big old, I mean, it's online these days, the big old textbook and look like it's, or you're in the United States, it's like you have to go look at Ohio or Pennsylvania, which have all these little local city or county based taxes. And it's incredibly instructive to look at just a few of those and think, wow, how do I think about configuring these change unannounced? Some city administrator or the city legislature, whatever they call them, they decide to change the tax rate. Well, how are we going to know about that? How are we going to change it? How are we going to change it so it's effective at the right time?

(00:36:14):
And you don't think about those things until you've gone all the way to ground and looked at how these things are actually worked, how they're communicated, and how they're thought through. And I think the same thing is true of every aspect of every product in different ways. Right? It might be a technical thing, it might be a design thing, it might be a compliance or a regulatory or a governmental thing, but whatever it is, that detail always exists. And unless you're getting down there and seeing it and understanding it firsthand, you don't really understand what your product needs to do.

Lenny (00:36:42):
And I think an important element of this that's between the lines maybe is don't delegate this to someone. You may have a tax expert on the team, and I imagine many leaders would be like, go figure this out and tell me. And I think what you're saying is you go do that and learn, become the world expert at it.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:36:55):
That's right. That's right. You go do it. You go learn and then we can make the case for hiring the tax expert, which we do have by the way now. That's an incredibly important part of our success is having that specialist but not before somebody with a product mindset. The tax specialist is amazing at tax, right? That's what they're, they love and that's what they do, but that doesn't make them necessarily a great product thinker. So the person with the product thing has to get into those same weeds first to really understand it.

Lenny (00:37:24):
Do you give any guidance and just how much time to spend on all that stuff versus the regular day-to-day of, say, a product leader on a team, it takes a lot of time to become a world expert on the tax systems of many countries, or is it just there's nothing more important than that, that is your job, and what are you doing not doing that? How do you think about it?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:37:42):
I think it's equally if a job is 80 hours a week, it's 40 of your hours. I think that you can't really understand a product unless you've gone there. Right? And yes, it takes time and you're right, you can't just ignore the other half of the job of communicating with the engineering team and writing documents or whatever, but what's the point of writing a document if you don't know what you're talking about? And so we very deeply value that. And it's one of the reasons that we keep, at least at Rippling, our product organization really thin. We expect a single leader to be able to know the full scope of the product. In fact, great product leaders can in fact do that because they have this native curiosity and interest and ability to absorb a lot of stuff. And it makes, it's a lot of fun because now I have a group of people around me who are all really good at what they do and really understand what they do and that's kind of just an amazing place to be.

Lenny (00:38:42):
I'm looking at this list and I just want to keep asking questions about it. One of the sure principles that I love is it reminds me of Amazon has the same principle I believe, which is leaders are right a lot.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:38:52):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:38:53):
Why do you find that to be important? I know you weren't necessarily design all these principles, but I imagine that something that you guys follow often and comes up a lot.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:39:01):
I mean, this is one of my favorite ones because I think particularly for a product org, right? Because product leaders have to be right most of the time because their decisions reflect across the entire org and their decisions fundamentally spend time and they spend energy. And if they make good ones, the company does really well. And if they make bad ones, the company doesn't. And one of the things I really value in product leaders are people who can go into an ambiguous information with ambiguous situation, with incomplete information and a complex decision space and can look at that and listen to everybody and read whatever they need to read and say, this is where we need to go.

(00:39:43):
And even if everyone else is like, ah, I don't know, that feels wrong for this reason, this reason if they have the confidence to make that call, and then a year later when you look back on it, for them to have been right, that's extremely valuable. And it's one of these things that it's really hard to test for. You can get it by talking with people and asking, "Hey, was this person usually right in respect?" And people think about it, but in the context of a given company, just you have to take the time and see if those decisions are largely right. And it's the one value we have. It's like you can't really learn it. Either you're really, really good at making those kinds of decisions or you're not, right? It's a very peculiar skill that we really value.

Lenny (00:40:28):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit, I know you all are going through this global expansion. We talked about this a little bit.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:40:28):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:35):
And so just a few questions along this lines, because a lot of companies start one country, most companies do, and then they decide let's expand to new markets. So I guess first question is just how do you decide which markets to go after? And specifically where to start first and then just prioritizing the list of markets? What's kind of your algorithm for that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:40:55):
So it starts with an assumption that we're going to have to be everywhere ultimately, that you don't actually have to build native global payroll in every country in the world. Just makes sense to do that every country in the world. But you definitely want to be able to pay people in any country in the world and you want to be able to have contractors anywhere in the world and have their information be in your HRS anywhere in the world. And so the decision for us, we were fortunate to, or when we made that decision, to have quite a few customers already, like thousands of customers. And so we knew not only where their kind of US employees were, but by virtue of being an employee system work, we actually knew where they had other employees. And so it was quite easy for us to say, focusing on US-based companies, which is incomplete data.

(00:41:35):
But if we just look at our US-based companies, we know that there is immediate demand for those people to pay people in countries X, Y, and Z. And we just listed those out in raw numerical order. And then we kind of looked at, okay, how hard is it to build in these countries and how valuable is it to build in these countries? What is the strategic value of building in the UK or Canada or Germany or India or wherever? And then we had a discussion on where is there risk or where is this hard? Where is there a long pull? Where does this like, in what countries does it take a long time to get approval or whatever? And we just stack-ranked them and then we revisited that decision. The early decisions that we made on exactly which countries. We have subsequently reordered those over time. And as we've dove, dived in the countries, and learned more, we rejigger things like a little bit. But for the most part, that same basic list we started with is still mostly right.

Lenny (00:42:29):
Okay. And then the other question a lot of founders always struggle with is when is the time to start expanding internationally? Because there's pros and cons. Do you have a sense of what convinced y'all to start going international?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:42:41):
I think our case is slightly special, but I think the right answer to that question is always before you think you do before you think you need to because there are, it's harder than everyone if they've never done it before, it's harder than you think it is. It's more specialized than you think it is. People in the UK really, really care if there is a U in color, just as we care if there's not a U in color. There's just all of these subtle lessons that, like cultural lessons for companies that take a really, really long time to absorb. And so my view is you always should do it earlier than you think you should that, than you think you have to. In our case, it was always something we knew we had to do. In fact, we have a very clear thesis that companies that aren't global, particularly in payroll, but also in kind of insurance and benefits in IT. If you're not global, you're just not going to be around in 10 years because companies were becoming global, and then COVID happened and companies became global much faster.

(00:43:35):
It stopped being the province of 100-person companies plus and started filtering down into very, very small companies. It just became commonplace for small companies to be multi-country. And so that very much accelerated our timetable. And then you saw other people noticed that too, and you saw other companies starting to try to address parts of this problem as well. And so there's this kind of competitive dimension, which is sort of secondary in most ways because we were going to do it anyway, but that also kind of adds a little bit of a fire under the thing.

Lenny (00:44:06):
What have you found to be most surprising about expanding internationally to be successful in expansion? For folks that are maybe starting down this road of like, oh shoot, we should think about that.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:44:16):
I think the thing that was most surprising to me the first time I did this back at Guidewire in the [inaudible 00:44:23] and remains the most surprising thing to most people every time I do this again, is that every country is unique. You can't just take your US-based approach and drop it into another country. Other countries find it insulting. It doesn't matter how much success you've had here. Everyone always believes rightly or wrongly that their local context is special. And you have to respect that. And it comes down to little things like they're being a you in color or not. Or if you ever see a demo delivered to somebody in another country where they see a detailed screen about a person and it includes a social security number, it's like that you immediately lose credibility. Doesn't matter how good all the rest of your stuff is.

(00:45:08):
And I think that that is consistently the thing that I think is most surprising to people is the degree to which that's true, which seems obvious in retrospect. If you took a German system or something and demoed it in the United States with poorly translated stuff, we would think it would suck too. But it's not, it's really hard to adapt to that mindset. And so it takes just a lot of energy to overcome that organizationally.

Lenny (00:45:32):
Makes tons of sense. I'm going to go in a different direction now.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:45:36):
Sure.

Lenny (00:45:36):
Frameworks. So I know that you're not a huge fan of frameworks. We were chatting about this before we started recording. And so I'm curious just to hear your perspective on why you're maybe not a fan of frameworks and then also just how you crystallize processes and concepts for your team if you're not just like, Hey, here's our framework you should use.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:45:54):
Look, I think frameworks are very helpful. So I'm not exactly anti-framework, but I am anti-process as a substitution for deep product thinking, right? So I like to have just enough process to create a frame so that the right decisions can happen and know more. And I think there's a danger, especially as companies scale, that you end up saying, well, if only we categorize everything correctly and Jira, like we will be able to make really good prioritization decisions. So I'm like, sure, extremely helpful to have clear categorization and things that Jira doesn't have like data and analysis and to be able to do all of that stuff. But what you really need to do is decide important to build and then have a way to build it really efficiently. And so I think the right answer, the right amount of process for any given team is like, or the right framework for any team is really just dependent on their specific life cycle.

(00:46:47):
So you won't see me saying like, oh, we need to use this scrum thing or that combine thing, or whatever the latest, newest thing is. It's like, don't care about any of that. What I care is about something that's going to enable this team in this context at this point in their life cycle to build the right thing as efficiently as possible. And I'm fine if those are different for different teams. And the only place I care about unification is one on the quarterly planning process. And two, everything does need in fact to be in Jira because otherwise, you can't rationalize about what's actually getting done in not.

Lenny (00:47:18):
Is there a process or framework that you find is counterproductive that you're just stay away from this thing? We've had a lot of trouble with it, or generally, it's like let's just rethink everything ourselves.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:47:31):
No, I don't find one to be particular, I don't consistently found one to be particularly problematic. So I think any framework sort of has its place, the right place, right time. I think there's danger any one time somebody like dogmatically says, I think we should use process X because that's almost never the right answer in my experience. I think there are places where that can differ. Like you start a company on the basis of process X and everyone's bought into that process and everyone understands it. I think they can be really, really great. And on the engineering side, I think this is hugely valuable. It's like test driven-development, first line of code's going to be a test, not the actual thing. Like fantastic, very supportive of all that. I think it's kind of different in the product world.

Lenny (00:48:08):
If you had to compare the way Coinbase builds product process-wise or just product development to Rippling, what would you say are the bigger differences?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:48:17):
I think the differences are largely born of the different domains. So crypto, as we talked about earlier, really hard to predict what's going on. There's all these questions about what's the future of crypto, what's going to matter, what do we even need to build? What's going to survive? And so the process we had at Coinbase run, having those debates and getting to a decision and disagreeing, committing. And then from an execution point of view, being able to move fast. That was the trick at Coinbase. Here we know the things that we need to build at a high level. And the trick is how do we really differentiate it on the basis of these amazing platform capabilities we have? Or how do we have to evolve those platform capabilities in order to continue to build something that's just discontinuously better than everything that's out there? And that yields a different decision-making process. So for me, it's the mental model is actually of how I approach those things with the same, but they just yield different results in the actual making of the software.

Lenny (00:49:12):
What is that actual difference? Do you find day-to-day? Is it timeline differences? Is it how quickly, I don't know the way you structure, how far out you plan, what do you find is the concrete difference as a result?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:49:25):
I think the difference is in the day-to-day velocity of decision-making, because we can, Rippling, if you're on, I don't know, pick a random team. If you're on the device management team, you know what you got to do, right? There's no ambiguity. You're not debating about whether Mac or Windows is going to exist in the future. There's none of that cognitive dissonance. There is, we need to build this. It's hard to figure out how we need to build this, right? Because there's all these different things that we could leverage, but we need to basically get this done.

(00:49:58):
And so the kind of total velocity I would say is higher here, which does not say people work harder or less are at Columbia. Columbia was an amazingly fast environment, but it was also subject to the fact that you just don't know what the crypto markets are going to do, and you have to be incredibly reactive to that. And so I think maybe that's the one thing, like the reactivity to the environment and the crypto environment, what's going on, and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment, all that stuff. We got really, really, really good at handling those things really rapidly, which is something that we need to handle somewhat less [inaudible 00:50:34].

Lenny (00:50:33):
Sounds quite stressful at Coinbase.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:50:38):
Yeah, I mean it was fun. Yes, it was stressful. I mean, every job I've ever had has been stressful, but in its own unique way. But all of that stress I think is in the shape of a problem, that's in the context of a problem that's really interesting. I mean that's why I stayed at these places. But yeah, it's stressful.

Lenny (00:51:00):
And looking back, what a joy.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:02):
Yeah. No, there are very good memories. I look back, I don't really, I remember the stress, but I don't like re-experience it, right. I remember foraging these relationships and building these amazing products that I've been so lucky to be a part of. And so I have almost only good memories of the places I've been.

Lenny (00:51:21):
That's what I find too. You go through these hardships and then you look back and you're like, wow, that was so cool. But assuming they go well, assuming the company works out and-

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:21):
True.

Lenny (00:51:29):
... it feels like it was successful. A lot of times you're at a startup, your life sucks for two years and it doesn't work out and that there is a lot of upside and good memories to that, but it's less glorious.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:41):
Yeah, that's fair though. I mean, the first company I was really at out of school's company called Reactivity back in internet one era, and we were trying to figure out how does this internet thing work and how do we start companies on the basis of these tech new technologies and how do we help other companies build stuff and figure it out? And that company fundamentally didn't work out, ultimately got kind of spun itself out and got acquired, which was great, but it was this extraordinary set of people that I was so lucky to work with and I loved all the time I spent there and it was foundational to everything else I ever did. And so even though that effort didn't pay off in the traditional set, the value of the learnings I had there and then the people I had a chance to work with was just really exceptional. So I feel very lucky.

Lenny (00:52:30):
That's a really good point actually. And I think I should correct even what I said that even when things don't work out, traditionally those experiences end up being incredibly valuable in all these unexpected ways.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:42):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny (00:52:44):
Yeah. Okay, so final topic.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:45):
Sure.

Lenny (00:52:45):
I want to talk about hiring product managers and interviewing.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:52:49):
So you've hired a lot of PMs over the years. I'm curious, what's something you've learned about what to look for in product managers and also just in product leaders that other people may not be focused on as enough?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:53:00):
I mean, I don't know that I have any particularly special insight here. I think there's a couple things that I do ask that maybe are more of an emphasis because it's Rippling than not. But the first of those is when people are going through our process, there's a part where they do this case study and an important part of the case study is that it's actually too complex for people to have all of the answers upfront. There's just the space of the problem is too large to do that, which means that in the interview there's a lot of opportunities or in the case study there's a lot of opportunities. So just ask ad hoc questions or to change one assumption. And seeing how people react to that is really indicative of how deeply they understand a new problem or how quickly or how mentally agile they are.

(00:53:47):
And some people are extremely good at that here in assumption and they blink a couple times. They're like, oh, well that has these 400 implications. And they just start rattling them off. And some people get really flummoxed. I mean obviously for our environment, that former is really, really important to us. I think the other thing that really matters to me is the insightfulness of questions that people ask, which is indicative of number one, their actual interest in the job.

(00:54:14):
People tend to ask better questions when they're more excited about working at a place and done their research and are asking people about it. And also the quality of those questions can vary quite dramatically. And that's okay. I don't expect the quality to be the same all the time, but sometimes people ask a question, I'm like, "Oh man, I would've never thought to ask that question. That's such an insightful question." And then I pause and I have to think about my answer a little bit. And so it kind of pushes me to be a little bit better. And when that happens, I know I usually have pretty good candidate on my hands.

Lenny (00:54:42):
Is there an example of someone asking a really good question that comes to mind that you think back to and like, Oh wow, that was great.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:54:49):
I remember about three years ago I was interviewing a guy named Kyle Boston and Kyle is now runs our platform product organization. And I can't remember the specific question he asked, but it had something to do with, wait a minute, if you have all these products and you have this employee system of record thing underneath it, we be thinking about how to create these various pillars of underlying platform technology, things like [inaudible 00:55:22] all this stuff. And this was before we fully formalized the concept of our platform beyond the kind of employee system of record.

(00:55:29):
And I remember thinking, yes, we should, and that had entered our minds before, but the fact that somebody which who had almost no context on the company, that's what was impressive about this question. It's like, man, you've been thinking about Rippling for a couple weeks while you're interviewing with a bunch of other companies or whatever. And you've thought about it deeply enough to have this insight into the nature of the platform that we're building immediately gave me a bunch of confidence in his ability to think through the sorts of things we need him to think through.

Lenny (00:55:58):
And I think it touches on PMs need to be business leaders and great questions are often about the business and the future of the business and how to make it run more efficiently and this, and there's a product org element to it. But I find that that's a really underappreciated element of PM interviews, just thinking about the bigger business, not just the PM product.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:56:19):
For me it's two things. It's thinking about the bigger business and having the context around whether it's revenue questions or strategy questions, but also the detailed questions. It's like, oh wait a minute. The implication of this thing that I'm getting asked or of this thing with Jeremy that you said earlier is all of these things. And their ability to understand that this isn't a simple business, it's really hard, it's really complex. And the ability to have these insights to help them think through those details is really cool.

Lenny (00:56:49):
You talked about this prompt you give product managers not to give away what you actually asked these days, but is there an example of a prompt that you've given in the past or you think is a good example of a type of prompt to give a product manager candidate.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:57:01):
In terms of a general kind of approach, I think a prompt should always reflect the actual business that they're going to kind of come into. So when we do, so our process overall is actually quite short. It's basically get in contact with us somehow, eventually get connected with a hiring manager, have a conversation with them. Then more or less you have a conversation with me, which is a product discussion. And then we have a case study which follows that. That's the whole process. Modulo, other conversations around the edges. And the questions that matter are around how do people think through that product discussion, which is relevant to our business. How do people think through that case study? That's number one. And the second thing is there's always a part of my interview, which is maybe sounds very simple, but it's just like, Hey, what questions do you have for me?

(00:57:53):
We actually do that before we do the product discussion. And that's an incredibly important question because it is again indicative of these things that people have thought through or not thought through or the depth that they're thinking or their interest in engagement in the role. And at that second discussion, it doesn't have to be perfect or anything, but it is a very strong signal when people, whether they've thought through a set of questions they want to ask or just on the fly generating them, you learn a lot about how people think about product, about what they're looking for, about what they like doing and not doing, just through those questions.

Lenny (00:58:30):
For PMs that are maybe in their early career that are listening to this, what advice would you give them to help them accelerate and advance their career most in the early part of their career?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:58:41):
Be humble. Being a product person means that by definition you're living in a world where no one knows the right answer yet because if somebody did, they would've already built it. And so having, no matter how smart you are, there's a lot of smart people out there. There's always stuff you don't know. There's always people who are going to know things that you don't know. And it is only through that acknowledgement that you can actually have the humility to say, I'm open to absorbing all of this stuff, I don't know. And open to synthesizing all this stuff and coming to different conclusions.

(00:59:12):
And so I found that that humility is one of the biggest differentiators in early career leaders who are able to let go of how awesome they were in school or in their first job or whatever. I mean, I had to do this and realize the job is always hard and the job is always about discovery every single day. And if you can maintain that curiosity and elasticity of thought and creativity and light coming solutions could be awesome. But if you close yourself off to that and think you always have the right answer, then there's like no hope.

Lenny (00:59:49):
This touches on another principle that I still have sitting on my screen here, which is great leaders change their minds a lot or just change their minds.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:59:57):
Yeah. Willing to look at new information and say, my mental model is adjusted by that or I was wrong very simply. I mean I think it's also important to be operating in an environment where you're allowed to say that you're wrong, right? Everyone's wrong sometimes. I mean be right a lot, but everyone's wrong sometimes. Right? And being in be able to be an environment where you can just say, yep, I was wrong. Here's the way in which I was wrong. Let's move on, is incredibly powerful.

Lenny (01:00:19):
The final question you've brought up Parker a number of times and something that is clear about him is that he's a very product-minded founder. He has a lot of strong opinions about what product should be. And as a product leader with a founder like that is often a challenging place to be similar to being the first PM at a startup and the founder has strong opinions about product. So my question is just what have you learned about being successful as a product leader with a founder that has very strong opinions about what the product should be?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:00:47):
Yeah, no, that's a great question. So I think you've got to be adaptable, right? It's like any other relationship, right? You have to understand what the nature of that relationship is, where that person's going to care, where you're going to care, the ways in which you can challenge each other. I think fundamentally you need to make sure that person is willing to be challenged, right? So I've seen product leaders or CEOs who are kind of unwilling to be challenged and I wouldn't be able to work with those people.

(01:01:17):
But yeah, Parker is incredibly strongly opinionated, but he's also incredibly informed, which makes for some really, really great debates. And I've just found that whatever, and it's not even CEO, but whatever a manager's idiosyncrasies are, you have to find a way to work with those. And I think that adaptability, like I'm just sort of, I like being a moldable puzzle piece where I can just fit in. I think that's actually one of my core skills. And so that's worked out for me and Parker and I before I started developing a deep foundation of respect, which is extremely important to building that. And over the years it's just gotten deeper and deeper and we don't always agree, but when we can have a totally reasonable discussion about it, and that's what makes it fun.

Lenny (01:02:06):
Adaptability actually is, I took a strength finder test once of finding my own strengths and that was my number one strength is I'm [inaudible 01:02:14] I think we share that.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:15):
That's excellent.

Lenny (01:02:15):
Yeah, seems like an important attribute for being in a place in. Well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you if you're ready.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:25):
All right, I'm ready. Hit me.

Lenny (01:02:27):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:31):
Well, first is my favorite series of books ever, which is the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson. It's a nine-volume epic or three-volume, nine-book epic depending on how you want to look at it. But it's about the time just before and into the enlightenment, historical fiction, a lot of fun. And I also love the Culture series by Iain Banks, which is just super fun, far-future sort of universe that I've really enjoyed.

Lenny (01:02:59):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:01):
Watched The Last of Us, was an avid fan of the game and I thought they did a really nice adaptation. Favorite mov, like I guess, recent movie, it's not that recent, but I really like Tenet, which I thought was a, I was impressed with their ability to go there and make that movie and I just really enjoyed it end to end.

Lenny (01:03:23):
It kind of ended, but we had a drinking game anytime someone mentioned Last of Us, which took over White Lotus. I'm going to drink some tea right here.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:30):
Okay, fair enough. I'll try. I've only got water normally I got tea, but water today.

Lenny (01:03:33):
That works. But it's interesting, it hasn't come up often, so I think maybe we end that for now and see what the new pattern emerges. And then Tenant feels like, I was just thinking it feels like a compound movie, compound startup as a movie, a movie is very complicated too to stay-

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:50):
Yeah, That's why I enjoyed it. I like trying to figure out the multi-timeline chart in my head as the movie progressed.

Lenny (01:03:56):
The puzzle piece within you trying to find all the puzzle pieces.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:59):
Yeah, for sure.

Lenny (01:04:00):
What is a favorite interview question you like to ask? You already maybe answered this, but anything else come to mind?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:06):
I think I did, no, my favorite one is What questions do you have for me by far?

Lenny (01:04:09):
Great. What are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you love?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:14):
I guess I'll just mention, I don't know if I go as far as I call these favorite products, but there's two that come to mind. My wife's computer broke the other day and I realized it was the CPU cooler that went bad and the Corsair H60 CPU cooler was super easy to use and really adaptable to lots of motherboards. I thought that was great. My other favorite product is the one I'm wearing in my ears right now, which my first pair of nice headphones I ever bought died late last week, and had to do some really quick research into my new favorite pair of headphones. And these Focal Bathys are super nice. I'm a bit of an audio file. I like to listen to classical music and ambient stuff, so we need a lot of dynamic range and noise cancellation and these have been great so far.

Lenny (01:04:57):
Okay, so what are they called?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:59):
Focal, I think it's Bathys, B-A-T-H-Y-S. Okay.

Lenny (01:05:04):
And has there a specific model or there's like that one?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:06):
That's it.

Lenny (01:05:06):
Okay.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:07):
You'll know it when you see it.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Okay. We will link to them in show notes, so maybe I'll get one. What's something relatively minor you've changed in the way that you built product that has had a lot of impact on your team's ability to execute?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:20):
Maybe the most recent innovation sort of at Rippling was the kind of introduction of what I'm calling imperatives. These things that whether they come bottom up or top down are things that like everybody across the entire product and engineering team needs to do and what's important about that list of things that are not on it. And in a world where we could choose to do hundreds of things at once, being able to force rank that list of things, draw a line, say these are the ones everyone has to do, has created a lot more focus and clarity than we had before.

Lenny (01:05:48):
So imperatives are essentially here's the priorities for the next, say quarter six months here?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:53):
Here are the priorities for everybody and now integrate that into your own team's priorities, right? So each team still is building their own priorities, but they have to factor in this set.

Lenny (01:06:05):
How many of those do you usually have? This is awesome. I like this tip.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:09):
It depends on what level of granularity you want to talk about them at, like maybe 10, right? It's a lot. We're going through between globalization and large improvements of the platform and a bunch of other large companies. All these things, it creates a bunch of things that just have to be cross-team simultaneously. I think it's pretty natural part of a company's evolution and we're just in that part of the cycle, so-

Lenny (01:06:33):
Awesome.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:33):
... used it.

Lenny (01:06:34):
Final question, what's a question I should have asked you that I didn't ask you?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:38):
I guess, what do I do with my kids maybe? I have two kids, they're nine and-

Lenny (01:06:38):
What do you do with your kids?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:43):
... six. What do I do with my kids? My son, I'm a big board gamer and while I didn't push it on him, my son, he will play board games morning to night. And so we play a lot of European strategy games together and my daughter's now getting old enough that she's getting into them too. And so we just finished as a family playing Pandemic Legacy and the reward tomorrow night as we get to start playing Gloomhaven. So that's going to be fun.

Lenny (01:07:12):
I don't know either game, sounds very hard and complicated.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:15):
They're fun. They're fun.

Lenny (01:07:17):
Amazing. Jeremy, we covered a lot of topics. I feel like this is a compound podcast episode and so thank you for spending time with me. Thanks for being here. Two final questions, working folks, finding online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:32):
Awesome. LinkedIn is the easiest way online and if what I've been talking about today sounds interesting to you, we're definitely hiring like senior entrepreneurial PMs. And so if those leadership principles on our website look interesting, I'd love to hear from you.

Lenny (01:07:46):
What's the best way to explore those roles and apply? The

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:49):
The website has by far the best channel. It gets to this right recruiter who will tell me about it right away.

Lenny (01:07:55):
Great, surfline.com and there's probably a site for careers.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:58):
There is a career site on there that you, pretty easy to find.

Lenny (01:08:00):
Okay. Rolling to that in the show notes. Jeremy, thank you again for being here.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:08:04):
Thanks so much for having me. This was a lot of fun.

# How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don’t want? | Jerry Colonna

## Transcript

Jerry Colonna (00:00:00):
We're socialized to bullshit not only ourselves, but everybody else, especially in the entrepreneurial community. All our companies are moving up into the right. Every product is working. We don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency. A perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Today, my guest is Jerry Colonna. Jerry is one of the most well-known and respected executive coaches in the world. He's co-founder and CEO of Reboot, an executive and leadership development firm grounded in the belief that better humans make better leaders. Prior to coaching, Jerry co-founded Flatiron Partners with Fred Wilson, which ended up being one of the most successful early-stage investment funds in the world. He's also a partner at JPMorgan Chase and the author of two books, Reboot and Reunion. As you might expect, this ended up being a very real and very open conversation about being busy and self-inquiry and the dangers of a growth mindset and the reasons that leaders and teams most often fail, and it's not what you think. Also, we talk about a very simple equation that Jerry and his team use to cultivate great leaders.

(00:01:37):

Jerry Colonna (00:04:19):
Well, thanks for having me, Lenny. It's really a delight to meet you and to be with you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:24):
I want to start with a very classic Jerry Colonna piece of advice that I've heard you share in other places, and I just want more people to hear this advice, and this is a question that you ask people when things aren't going their way, and I'll give you a hint. The question contains the word complicit.

Jerry Colonna (00:04:40):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
Can you share this question and why it's so important to ask this of yourself?

Jerry Colonna (00:04:45):
The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? And if it's helpful, let me break down the question a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
Please.

Jerry Colonna (00:04:58):
So I purposely chose the word complicit because complicit does not mean responsible, and that's a really important distinction. And as I often say, to understand the word complicit, think of the word accomplice. As I will share, you are driving the getaway car, you're not sticking up the bank teller. The second half of that question is I say I don't want. And sometimes people hear that question and they interpret it as, how have I been responsible for the shit in my life? And that is not the purpose of this question. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency, is to look at the ways in which you may have been diluting yourself.

(00:05:56):
A perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. And the reason that this is all really important is part of my approach not only to coaching, but to the process of growing up, is to use what I call radical self-inquiry, to really cut through our own delusions and say, how does it serve me to feel completely busy to the point where I feel exhausted? And perhaps there's another more conscious way of getting that feeling than feeling like crap all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:56):
This is a good segue to something that I hear you. You have this equation that you and your firm use to think about how to create and cultivate great leaders, and it includes one of the variables is radical self-inquiry. Can you share this equation and just how you work with folks to build this in them?

Jerry Colonna (00:07:14):
Sure. I'll tell a little story about that. I remember one time I was, this is how the equation came to be. I was doing a talk, I think here in Boulder at Naropa University where I used to be on the board of trustees. It's a Buddhist university, and as is often the case, I'm winging it as I go and I'm walking around probably without shoes on because that's what I do. And there was a dry erase board behind me and I was trying to explain what it was that I do, what it was that I encourage people to do. And I jumped up at the board and I wrote practical skills. And in writing that, what I was trying to convey, what it is that people typically come to a coach for. They want to understand how to do their job. They want to understand how to live. They want to understand the how.

(00:08:11):
And then, I wrote plus, and then I sketched out radical self-inquiry. And I said in that moment, I said, "People will come and ask me how, and I will drive them crazy because I will say something like, tell me about your father, or tell me why you chose to be in the job you're in the first place, or tell me about your relationship to money, or tell me about your relationship to self-worth." And then, I expanded it and I put another plus sign and I said, "Shared experiences." And then, I drew an equals equation line underneath the whole thing, and I said, "Enhanced leadership plus greater resiliency."

(00:09:05):
And so, the equation is practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences, that is the process of actually talking about the craziness that goes on in your head equals greater leadership. That all makes sense. But then, there was this other piece, enhanced resilience. And when I do this on a dry erase board, I will often circle that phrase, and I say that is the purpose of this whole thing, because the truth is, if you follow my story at all, you know that in my late 30s, the depression that had really marked most of my life had gotten so bad that despite my outward success, I was suicidal and lost.

(00:09:58):
And I will turn to the audience and I say, "I get you want to be a great CEO, I get you want to be a great executive, but what I really care about is you not killing yourself in the process." So if we take a step back, the whole point of what we refer to as the equation really boils down to that point, how do we grow up and become the leaders, the adults we were born to be without feeling like crap?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):
And there's this huge implication here that a lot of people think that when they reach a certain point, become successful, make a certain amount of money, get a beautiful house, still be happy. And essentially what you're saying here is that's very often not the case. Maybe in most cases, not the case.

Jerry Colonna (00:10:48):
It's not only not the case, it's the big lie that we're socialized with since childhood. I remember one time I was on the road doing a talk for, I was promoting my first book, Reboot, and I was at, I think it's called the Fitler Club in Philadelphia. I was doing a fireside chat. And after talking with my conversation partner, a guy named Chris Fralic who was one of the co-founders at First Round, really, really good guy. We turned to the audience and there was a Q&A as there often is, and this young guy shoots his hand up and he introduces himself and he says, "I'm 19." And he looks over to his right and his mother's sitting there and he says, "And my mother brought me here," which I laughed.

(00:11:40):
And he said, "So what you're telling me is you don't have to be an asshole to be successful." And I could not think of a better summation of everything that I'm about than for a 19-year-old kid to look up and say, "You don't have to be an asshole to be successful." And of course, the corollary to that is you don't have to feel miserable just because you're trying to create a career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):
As people start to think about this and think, okay, I feel like I've been heading in this direction of I just need to keep climbing the ladder, making more money, as they hear you talk, what's the pivot that folks should make in their mind around where they should actually be heading? What is a direction where they'll end up not wanting to kill themselves, in spite of being successful?

Jerry Colonna (00:12:34):
To be clear, not everyone ends up in that level of depression, but the hack, if you will, is consciousness. So what do I mean by that? Part of what makes radical self-inquiry radical is we're socialized not to ask certain kinds of questions. So for example, someone says, "It's really important for me to be ambitious and achieve a particular goal." What's radical, a radical question to ask is, and what will that do for you? What is it that you believe being "successful" will do for you? How do you define success? Where does that come from?

(00:13:30):
In Reboot, my first book, I tell the story of what I refer to as my pursuit of lemon drops. And briefly, when I was a boy, there was a lot... I grew up with an enormous amount of chaos and insecurity, financial and otherwise. And a big source of stability in my life were my mother's parents, my grandfather and grandmother. And Grandpa Guido, who was an ice man and emigrated from southern Italy in early 20th century, always seemed to have, well, he had this endless supply of lemon drops, and they were always kept in this green pantry outside of the kitchen. And for me, the stability and what I considered wealth seemed to match to this notion of this endless supply of lemon drops. And when I got to my 30s and I was outwardly successful and I was a hot shot BC, I had lemon drops, but I didn't feel safe, which was a mindful.

(00:15:02):
And so, I told that story in Reboot as part of my exploration into the core question of how did my relationship to money shape my career choices, shape my school choices, shape my own sense of safety and self-worth? So long-winded response to your question, what I encourage people to do is to ask themselves these kinds of questions so that they can raise their level of consciousness so that they can be in the driver's seat of their lives and not some learned behavior that they developed as a child to answer perhaps their parents or grandparents' anxieties.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
I feel like a lot of people hearing this are afraid to ask these sorts of questions. The reason they don't ask these questions is because they worry that this is going to be like, okay, I got to quit my job, move to the woods, give up all these luxuries they have. I don't even want to think about that. I got a whole family to support. I got to succeed. Advice for getting over that hump of just like-

Jerry Colonna (00:16:17):
So let's just pause, Lenny. Okay, so what you're doing in this moment is empathetically imagining what may be going on for your listener, but the empathy is actually based on your own question because you invited me on the show, you knew I was going to get to this point. So I'm imagining that as you take this in, that thought stream shows up for you. "Jerry," says Lenny, "If I open up that closet, all the shit's going to fall out, and what am I going to do with it?" Does that resonate at all?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:58):
This is why I was nervous to have you on this podcast. I knew what you-

Jerry Colonna (00:17:05):
So answer my question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:07):
I don't think it's that strong for me to be afraid of that because I've taken a different path already and gotten off the career ladder climbing treadmill. On the other hand, back to your original question, we talked about being busy. I'm very guilty of that. I'm constantly trying to do less, but constantly doing more, and my life is just very busy.

Jerry Colonna (00:17:28):
Thank you for giving me more of that answer. And trust me, your listeners are going to appreciate you being fully there in just the way you were. So let's take a step back. The fear is, if I can reflect back to your original question, the fear is if I go there, I don't know what's going to happen as a consequence of that. If I pause and ask myself, is this relationship working out for me? I might end up leaving this relationship. If I pause and ask myself if this career isn't working for me, I might leave my career.

(00:18:25):
And the good news bad news is that's true. That is absolutely true. And if we look at some of the other observations we were making before like anxiety and depression, we have this belief system that if I pay no attention to the thing that I'm afraid of, it's somehow going to magically go away. If we pay no attention to the source of discomfort, it's somehow going to go away. And that's not actually how life works. More often than not, what we do is we respond to the source of challenge, whether it's a discomfort in our relationship, whether it's a discomfort in the way my life has unfolded. We respond to it by plasting over band-aids and sometimes they're relatively healthy, we become obsessed with working out, or sometimes they're unhealthy. We become obsessed with work or substance abuse or that kind of thing. Or sometimes, and this is super popular right now, we lean into what I would call as a spiritual bypassing where we go to Peru and we go do ayahuasca or we spend the weekend doing mushrooms with friends...

(00:20:08):
And what we're really not doing, Lenny, is confronting the parts of ourselves that need some tending to because we're afraid of the consequences. But I'll tell you a quick quote. One of my favorite books is Bruce Springsteen's autobiography, and about in the middle of the book, he has this passage where he talks about having spent 25 years in psychoanalysis. So let me just let that statement land. Bruce fucking Springsteen, 25 years in psychoanalysis. And he has this passage where he talks about the unsorted baggage of our childhood. And what he rightly asserts is that we all have unsorted baggage, and at some point we're going to pay the price of not sorting that baggage. And the price more often than not is in tears.

(00:21:21):
Now, this is Bruce Springsteen talking about this. This is not some airy-fairy transpersonal Jerry Colonna coach. And the reason I draw that out is we as children are socialized not to develop these consciousness skills. We are socialized to develop what I would call bypassing skills. And as he correctly points out, if you continue to bypass sorting out your baggage, there's going to come a day where you're going to have to pay that price. It could be in your own depression, it could be in, I've seen this a thousand times Lenny, entrepreneurs sabotaging their successful businesses because the belief system from their childhood goes something like, I don't deserve success so let me blow it up. We put this all under the rubric of midlife, but I don't know, when does midlife begin, 35? When does it end, 70? What I do know is it's the bulk of our adulthood.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
Okay, I think you've done an excellent job convincing me and others to spend time on this now, and I think there's an assumption of it gets harder, the tears get more intense as you wait longer. There's this ticking time bomb that better some amount of tears now than 10 times more tears later. Is that right?

Jerry Colonna (00:23:04):
Well said.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
Okay. So coming back to this equation, I think I want to give people some things to do now that they may be likely convinced, okay, I should really rethink what I'm doing. So back to the equation, practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences equals enhanced leadership and greater resilience. So the three things you can work on are practical skills, radical self-inquiry, shared experiences, skills I think people get. So radical self-inquiry, these are essentially questions to dig into what drives you, what makes you happy. What are some questions again that people should be asking there as they're listening or maybe after they finish listening?

Jerry Colonna (00:23:40):
In the time since I've been a coach, which is now going on 27 years, the popularity of journaling has gone up, which is awesome. And part of what happens is people journal, but they don't know what they should be journaling or how they should. So let me give some questions then, and this is a way to approach it. Let's imagine that what we're trying to do, whether we're sitting in meditation, whether we're journaling, whether we're taking time away, we're just pausing and starting to ask ourselves questions. So my famous questions include things like, what am I not saying that I need to say? So let's imagine ourselves in a relationship that's not working.

(00:24:30):
Talk about something that could be terrifying. What am I not saying in that relationship that I need to say? By the way, this is a good question to ask if one is responsible for leading people too. Corollary questions to that would be, what am I saying that's not being heard? And then, of course, what's being said that I'm not hearing? So if we just pause and look at those four questions, how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? And what's being said that I'm not hearing? Can you feel the power of all of that in those questions?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:25):
Yeah. Scary questions.

Jerry Colonna (00:25:27):
They are scary questions. You know you're in the radical self-inquiry zone when the questions take your breath away, when the questions, and by the way, you don't have to share the answers to these questions with anybody but yourself. Now, there could be some power in sharing them in a group of friends and sharing them with a group of colleagues, sharing them with a coach, sharing them with a therapist. But the most important person with whom you should share the answers is oneself. This is a little bit of Buddhism here. Self-delusion along with attachment are the biggest contributors to our own suffering. Self-delusion. Everything's great. How you doing? Everything's great. Bullshit. Can we just not bullshit each other?

(00:26:30):
So let me just pause. Those are just four questions. My first book Reboot has a set of questions after every single chapter. We also have a journal that we put out that has questions and questions, but the more important thing to take away from this is questions that startle us, questions that may cause us to be a little afraid of the answer, that's where the gold is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:02):
And we'll point people to the book for many more of these questions and the worksheets. For the third party equation, shared experiences, can you explain what that is?

Jerry Colonna (00:27:11):
We were talking about socialization, for example. Prior to launching Reboot, the company, my co-founder, Ali Schultz and I, the roots of Reboot the company began with me designing, or Ali and I designing these boot camps. And the original iteration of the boot camp, we used to call CEO Boot Camp because it was originally we would get first-time CEOs together and we would do a bait and switch. We would pretend to sell them practical skills, and then I would start asking really tough questions like who would you be without the story of who you are? It's like what?

(00:27:57):
The notion of shared experience as an important component grew out of that. Because what would happen is imagine sitting in a circle of people who just have your back, who really care about you as a person. And imagine then discussing some of the answers to those questions. Who would you be without the story of who you are? What is it that you wish that people in your life knew about you, but you're too afraid to tell them? And imagine sitting in a group of people who can just hold that space without fixing you, without telling you what you're doing right or wrong? We, too often than not, especially in what I would say the entrepreneurial community are socialized to bullshit not only ourselves, but everybody else. All our companies are moving up into the right, every product that's working, we don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. Imagine having the capacity to be in relationship with people where you can just tell the truth. That's what shared experiences are about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):
My wife does a women's circle where they gather and just share what's really going on within in their lives. And it's-

Jerry Colonna (00:29:26):
That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):
And it's very confidential. There's a ritual to it, and it feels like that's a really good avenue for things like that.

Jerry Colonna (00:29:42):
What circle do you sit in?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
No circles. This is my circle.

Jerry Colonna (00:29:49):
But there is something powerful here. I think in the last 15 years, the rise of podcasts, good podcasts. What I think what happens is let's hope this is happening for your audience right now, good quality intimate conversation between people who are authentic and real, creates space for someone to be authentic and real, even if it's just with themselves. So you're doing a mitzvah, you're doing a good deed by creating this space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:24):
Thanks, Jerry. Let's go back to the busyness point, and I'll talk about myself a bit to get it real again, because I think it's also something a lot of people struggle with. I listen to this, they're just like, I'm so busy, and every time someone ask me how I'm doing, busy, so busy, like swirly eyes emoji, swirly eyes emoji.

Jerry Colonna (00:30:45):
With a little head shake.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:47):
That's right. And the melting face emoji. And that's very much me. And it's funny because I started this journey of the newsletter of just like I call the project avoid getting a real job. And it was just like, cool, just do this newsletter thing, not have the job. It'll be chill, write an email once a week. But I just find myself taking on endlessly more and more. And for me, I feel like the drive is it's just fun to see it grow and for it to keep building and doing well.

(00:31:17):
This reminds me, there's a quote that Will Smith shared once that I think you'll like. Someone asked him what it's like to be famous, and he's like, "Really awesome as you're going up to fame. Pretty okay as a famous person. Really bad when you lose that fame." And that's how it feels with the growth of this thing. It's just like growth is up. Oh, life's good, and then it starts to stall. I'm like, oh, no, it's all going to fall apart. So I think that's where a lot of that comes from for me. It's just like, oh, what's next? I got to, let's see what else I can do here.

Jerry Colonna (00:31:44):
Well, how do you feel about yourself when you're on that growth trajectory?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):
I feel great.

Jerry Colonna (00:31:52):
Say more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
I feel like I'm achieving and heading in a... Part of it is just fun. It's like fun to win. So it's just like, yeah, we're doing it. It's working.

Jerry Colonna (00:32:07):
And when you're not growing, how do you feel about yourself?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:13):
About myself. There's this sense that it's all over. Oh, maybe it's all going to fall apart, and maybe I'm not as good at this as I thought, and maybe-

Jerry Colonna (00:32:25):
Okay, so stay in that spot for a moment. So imagine, and I don't know that this is true, but I can imagine that there's a little whispery voice in your head that's always there that says, "Lenny, you're not as good as you think you are. In fact, Lenny, they might even find out."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
Yep. Yeah, imposter syndrome.

Jerry Colonna (00:32:52):
Oh, shit. So by being busy and by being on that growth trajectory, that voice maybe sounds a little less persistent, maybe a little less loud. Now, I want to offer a different potential. What if you could enjoy the puzzle of trying to create something new, trying to create magic, something out of nothing, but it doesn't matter to your sense of self-esteem if you succeed or fail. What if what drove you was not quieting that voice, but what drove you was, oh, this is just fun? Seth Godin, who's a dear, dear friend of mine, talks about art projects.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
Also a former podcast guest.

Jerry Colonna (00:33:57):
So what if you just approached the project as if it was an art project? I think it's going to show up this way. What if it turns out it's wrong? What if it's this? What if it's that? And your sense of self-esteem is not attached to the outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):
What's interesting is that's how I started this whole thing. I had no intention of it being a career and way I make a living. It was just, this is cool, people seem to like it, I enjoy it. Let's just see where it goes. No expectations.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:28):
And then what happened?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
And then it worked.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:30):
It became successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):
That's right. It worked out.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:33):
Right. It became successful, meaning you developed an audience, meaning you developed a following.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:41):
And then, income. That was a big part of it.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:43):
And then you developed an income, and then the stakes went up, and then all of a sudden, my heart, the anxiety.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:54):
Not quite that strongly. At times it is, but there's a bit of just, oh, wow, I am relying on this now. I can't just let it fall apart.

Jerry Colonna (00:35:03):
Because my life would fall apart if I let it fall apart.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:07):
Yeah, life would change in a big way if this whole thing ends.

Jerry Colonna (00:35:11):
Right. Right. So what you're talking about, what we're talking about right now, remember before I said in Buddhism, we talk about self-delusion and attachment. Now, we're talking about attachment. When we become attached to the outcome, we inadvertently fuel our own suffering. When we become attached, and in this case, okay, I get it. There's a financial reality. This is important because it helps pay the bills, if it doesn't entirely pay the bills. Great. Got it. Fabulous. But really the deeper attachment is see, I'm not nothing. See, I'm not a nobody, I'm a somebody, and that's the source of the suffering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
That is so true. That is very much a part of what has driven me is I was always a very shy kid growing up, and I don't think people expected a lot of me except my mom and dad, I guess. And so, I always had the sense, I'll show them, I'll show them what I could do, and that's always, it's this chip on the shoulder thing that I know drives a lot of people.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:29):
How old are you, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):
43.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:30):
Okay. So maybe now at 43, you can take in the fact that you are somebody regardless of what you do. What's your wife's name?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:48):
Michelle.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:49):
Is she going to love you even if the podcast fails?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
Absolutely.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:55):
What, is she an idiot? No, she's a smart person. The people who actually know you and care about you may be proud of your efforts, but their love for you is not dependent upon its success. And that's like a rewiring. Do you have children?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
Yeah, we got a 22-month-old now.

Jerry Colonna (00:37:30):
Oh, mazel tov. That's wonderful. My children are 34, 32, and 28. So I'll speak like the old man that I am. When we take that test, that spelling test, and we stick it with magnets on the refrigerator, it's at a pride. The challenging message that we inadvertently can send to our children is that we only love them because they got an A on the spelling test. And so, it's really critically important that we as parents do our own internal work to convey that unconditional love that is our birthright as human beings. And we hold onto the goal because the goal is cool, because solving a puzzle is fun, because doing hard work and experiencing the reward from that is affirming, but your value as a human being is unshakable. Now, as a father, isn't that the feeling you want your child to have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):
Absolutely. And there's a lot of parenting advice these days that helps you learn to do that. There's all these TikToks now, don't say good job. Just say good choice or great, hard work. Great job working hard on that.

Jerry Colonna (00:39:04):
Right, right, right. I don't know how I feel about getting parenting advice from TikTok, but okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:12):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Andrew Luo (00:39:19):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:21):
So what is new with OneSchema, I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.

Andrew Luo (00:39:37):
Yes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema file feeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?

Andrew Luo (00:40:11):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:32):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:40:46):
Just to close loop on this, I think as people hear this, I feel like, okay, cool, everything falls apart. Sure, my parents will love me, my wife will love me, they won't think less of me. However, it's nice to get that really nice couch and that nice hotel and the income, the comfort that comes with income at a certain level is hard to give up. How do you help people get past that that might go away and feel comfortable?

Jerry Colonna (00:41:09):
Well, the good news is, and again, this is a Buddhist reference. The good news is there's a wisdom tradition that teaches all about this. So very briefly, the Buddhist story is in his mid-30s, he wakes up to the truth of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Birth, old age, sickness and death. And he wanders into the forest and he becomes a wandering mendicant and he becomes a holy man, and he's still not satisfied. And as I like to tell the story, one day he decides, fuck it, I'm just going to sit under the Bodhi tree and I'm not going to move until I figure this shit out. And so, he sits and sits and sits, and the story is he sat for 40 days living on a single grain of rice every day because always right, crazy stuff.

(00:42:05):
And when he woke up, he woke up to the four noble truths and the four noble truths are life is filled with suffering, that which we do to push away suffering increases suffering. The third noble truth is that there's an end to suffering. That's a really important one. And the fourth noble truth is what's known as the eightfold path to the end of suffering.

(00:42:34):
So let's focus on the second noble truth because that's really what you're talking about. When we acquire that nice couch, when we buy that nice house that stretches our income to its maximum, if we're doing it to enjoy the couch or the house, then A-OK. But if we're doing it because we're trying to push away the suffering of am I good enough to be loved, to feel safe, and that I belong, that which we do to push away suffering will increase suffering. And in this case, oh my God, what if they take my house away from me? Oh my God, what if I fall backwards down that staircase of life? Oh my God, what if all of those people who have signed up to my Substack suddenly disappear? You see how the attachment becomes that source of suffering? You see how the thing that we do to make ourselves feel better in fact fuels the tenuous hold that we have on our OK-ness? I'm okay just as I am. I'm okay.

(00:44:03):
It all comes down to why we're doing what we're doing. Now, to be clear, this is hard for me. I think it's hard for everybody. When my first book came out, Dan Harris, who's a really good friend and client from 10% Happier said to me, "Don't read the Amazon reviews." The truth is, I've read two reviews. I read it in the first hour after it was released, and I've never read a review since because there's no way I can experience those reviews without becoming attached to how people feel. So thank you. I'll put it over here and I'll just stay focused on the experience that I get from writing.

(00:45:04):
And yes, do I want to sell thousands of books? Do I want people to feel moved by my writing? I do, but you know who gets the most out of my writing? Me, because when I sit down, this is my file folder for whatever I might do for our next book, what I'm trying to do is answer questions that I have. For example, Captain Chaos is running the country right now. What is it that the world is going to need two or three years from now? And what's my contribution to that world? Now, just as I say that, how does that feel to you? It's kind of settling. So I know that in order for me to feel good about my existence on this planet, I have to ask myself these questions and I have to attempt to answer these questions. Whether it turns into a book that people buy or not is secondary, I have to do this work regardless.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:22):
That super connects with exactly again, the way I started this whole thing is I started writing just to crystallize my own thinking, and it ends up being useful to other people.

Jerry Colonna (00:46:33):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):
People hear this and they're like, why would I want to give up this great couch and house and car and all these things? That's really hard. And risking that by just doing something that feels good versus it'll make income, but it actually works. That's what I found. If you focus on a thing that is useful to yourself and interesting and not come at it from how do I make the most amount of money and turn this into whole thing, but more just, this is really interesting. I'm going to see where this goes. It will work for me.

Jerry Colonna (00:47:00):
Lenny, you implicitly asked a how question a few minutes ago. How do I do this? How do I do this radical self-inquiry? And I asked, I responded by offering a few questions. Let's build upon that for a moment, because what you are articulating right now is in the process of asking those questions, you can go back to what Simon Sinek would say is your why. You could go back to your core principle. You could go back to the centerpiece within you, which is what do I believe to be true about the world and how do I want to be in that world? You know what animates me right now is a question? With my children being fully fledged adults, I am really focused on what kind of ancestor to my descendants would I like to be? 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, I'll be gone. What would I like those who follow after me to believe to be true about me?

(00:48:11):
And you just paused. I can tell from the Adam's apple jumping up and down, that that question landed for you. It's a question of legacy. It's a question of meaning and purpose. At the end of my days, this is a question in Reboot, at the end of my days, what would I like the people who come after me to say about me? And what I want people to say about me is that he gave a shit about the world, he cared, and he tried, and he was kind. Those are the things that matter to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:00):
I'm always reminded of that frame of reference when I go to a funeral and people reading the eulogy and the old advice of what do you want your eulogy to say and making that your mission. But on the flip side, there's this viral video of Mike Tyson. Someone was coming up to him I think before his big match recently, and asked him about his legacy, and he's like, "I don't give a shit about my legacy. It's just a made up thing that doesn't matter." So let me just ask you this. Why is it important to think about legacy? Does legacy even matter? We're dead. What's the difference?

Jerry Colonna (00:49:33):
Far be it for me to criticize Mike, and don't hit me Mike, because even as an old guy, I wouldn't want to be hit by Mike Tyson. I don't know what's behind his response, but I can tell you what's true for me. I made oblique reference to Captain Chaos in the world as it is right now. The world's a tough place right now. We live in a world where it's almost normalized that a teenager will shoot other teenagers in school. It's almost normalized that people are dragged off to jail. Something is happening, something that's really disturbing.

(00:50:28):
Now, to be clear, we've always had disturbing times. I mean, I was reminded recently, I'm reading a book called Soldiers and Kings, which I highly recommend, which is about human smuggling from Central America into the United States, and it's an extraordinary book. And in reading that, I was reminded of policies that the US government has used over the years, whether it's supporting dictators in Central America or other sorts of things, things that I oppose, that feel immoral, if not directly immoral.

(00:51:15):
Why does this come up for me? I can't shake the feeling that someone down the line in my lineage is going to ask of me, "And what did you do, grandpa? And what did you do, great grandpa?" I know what I want that answer to be, which is I tried. Lenny, God gave me the ability to put two sentences together in a way that people listen. I feel a moral responsibility to use that God-given gift to help create the world, that I would like to see, a world of kindness and empathy, a world where poverty is diminished, a world where people feel safe however the fuck they identify. I don't give a damn. So is that my legacy? Yeah, and maybe there's some ego implicit in that, but can I go on for just a bit on this?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:54):
Absolutely.

Jerry Colonna (00:52:55):
At the end of Reboot, I write about this moment, and in this moment I am in Marin County. My wife Allie and I are together. And I'm once again torturing myself with this question. Have I been a good man? I drive myself crazy with that question. Have I been a good father? Have I been a good partner? Have I been a good man? And she says, in a very frustrated way, "All right, already. Enough. You're a good man. Stop." And so, I go for a walk, and as I'm walking, I encounter this toppled over oak tree and the roots are all torn up and you've seen trees like this, and clearly the tree died and clearly a wind came and clearly knocked the whole thing down. And I look at the tree and I say to myself, "Here lies a good man."

(00:53:57):
And I liken myself to this toppled over oak tree, and I imagine that that tree had lived its life with its limbs gnarled and twisted by actions that it should have taken and actions that it shouldn't have taken, but good choices and bad choices. But that for the majority of its 75, 80 years, it lived into its purpose of providing shelter and shade for those that may have come from beneath it. And I make this point that at the end of my days, I want to be like this tree just slowly dissolving into the earth, having done the best job I could of being purposeful. I feel better. My suffering is eased when I can lean into that, which then makes me able to be present for the other person, whether it's a coaching client, whether it's a podcast conversation, whether it's just going for a walk with one of my children. I just feel better, and I think I am a better person when I think about things like that. So far be it from me to disagree with Mike Tyson, but I think he's wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:34):
Good callback. It sounds like The Giving Tree to me.

Jerry Colonna (00:55:38):
Oh, yes, yes. Shel Silverstein.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:43):
To give people something to do with this area of legacy. How did you approach coming up with figuring out what you wanted your legacy to be? Are there some questions you asked? Is there something you recommend folks do to help think through this for themselves?

Jerry Colonna (00:55:57):
Well, it's delightful that we've ended up here because I think that I'm still working through those questions. As I said before as we both connected with, I use my writing to find my way to answers to questions. So part of what I'm dealing with right now is, look, I'll turn 62 this year. That feels old, but it also feels settled. And part of what I'm trying to figure out is what do I want my elderhood to be like? And I'll be honest, I'm enjoying this time of my life where I'm finding myself being a voice of comfort, being a voice of maybe even sanity in a time where that feels really insane and challenging. So maybe that's what my legacy will be. I'm not 100% sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:03):
Is this maybe hinted the new book you're working on? Is this the topic you're thinking about or is this not?

Jerry Colonna (00:57:09):
Yeah, and other things. That's right. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:15):
Speaking of the world being very crazy right now, you talked about your kids, AI is very top of mind for a lot of people in particular. It's stressing a lot of people out. In a lot of ways, it's quite unsettling in future careers, in skills, people-

Jerry Colonna (00:57:29):
It is unsettling, isn't it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):
Quite unsettling, but there's a world where we don't need humans in the future, potentially. Just what advice do you share with clients to help them work through this period of worry with the future, with AI being the core of it?

Jerry Colonna (00:57:45):
Well, if we go back to the equation for a moment, I think it's really important that we actually talk about these things. I would say a year ago, I likened it to the experience that I had. Remember, I'm old enough to remember when not everything had an IP address. Now, our refrigerators have IP addresses. I mean, it's freaking crazy. I'm old enough to remember when you had to install an IP stack into your personal computer in order to connect to the web. That's how old I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:22):
Did you have the phone modem where you had to put the phone?

Jerry Colonna (00:58:26):
Absolutely. Absolutely. It was a big, big deal to go from 1,200 baud to 2,400 baud to 56K. Oh my God, it was like a rocket ship. A year ago, I thought we were going through a similar kind of transition. We're clearly not. This is different. And in the coaching therapeutic world, everybody's like, "Oh my God, ChatGPT is going to replace me." And I don't know, maybe. What I am finding is... I wear glasses. So for those of you who are only listening to the audio, you may find that news. What I am finding is in my own life, it's like I have put on a pair of glasses that are really, really sharp and helpful, and it is disturbing and unsettling because I think it does challenge this question of what is our role as human beings?

(00:59:46):
Now, what I come back to, and I could be wrong, but what I come back to is we're talking through a medium, a mediated experience. My signal is bouncing up into the sky and to a satellite. I won't name the company, it's coming back down. I don't know what your access is. We're using this platform or a site to record this, but somehow we're still finding the capacity to be present for one another in a heart-to-heart way.

(01:00:30):
And so, when I look at these phenomena, what I lift up is that. What I am hopeful about is that that which does not matter in the experience of being human gets burned away and is taken care of, call it by AI, but that that which matters, which is presence and connection, human-to-human contact, strategic thinking, formulation, you want to talk about it in terms of engineering, the conceptualization, that that gets elevated and our skills get better at doing that. And in the most optimistic point of view, what ends up happening is we spend more time on that which matters, and less time on that which doesn't matter. And I could be completely wrong and we could all be out of work and making sure that the robots are well-oiled, and that becomes our purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:47):
Along these lines of glasses and even coaching, the world of coaching, there's a really interesting use case I saw today that Dan Shipper shared that I think you'd love, which is now that ChatGPT has memory, remembers everything you've said, and you can think back, you can ask it, "What are blank spots in the way I see the world that I'm not seeing?" You could also upload all your chat transcripts from your meetings and ask it what could you do better in meetings?

Jerry Colonna (01:02:14):
Look, one of my colleagues in the coaching company, he has uploaded, he kept all of his journal entries, I think over 10 years journal entries from Evernote, and he uploaded that. I think he uses Claude, and he's asked Claude to highlight things. What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? He's asked it to reflect back, and I think it's been incredibly helpful for him. I think the result is that he is a better coach, which is interesting, because the feeling is, well, does this replace it? I am finding, I'm using ChatGPT really as a writing and thinking partner in a way that I did not have before, and I'm still using my live real human writing buddies, which are really important to me. Where does this all end up? I had no idea. It is unsettling, it's uncanny, and it's also enlivening and exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:31):
Well put. I love that you can ask these hard questions of Claude/ChatGPT, these questions that make you really scared could ask it what are the answers, and even not have to do the hard work and maybe get a better answer. I doubt that that will give you the best answers.

Jerry Colonna (01:03:47):
Well, what it might do, which I think would be wonderful, is it might give you more questions to ask yourself. I'm a huge fan of powerful questions and the answer I give to a question like what am I not saying that I need to say? That question, you can ask yourself that question every single day. The question of how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? You can ask yourself that question every single day. To take a step back, the subtitle of my first book is Leadership in the Art of Growing Up. The Art of Growing Up is a practice. It's not a scientific moment where one day you wake up and you're done. It's an ongoing practice of not continuous improvement, but continuous inquiry that can feel exhausting when you contemplate it, but enlivening when you live it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
All this, some people may think of as this whole idea of growth mindset. I know that you're not a big fan of this term, that it's used in a harmful way a lot of times. Can you just talk about that why you find that growth mindset as a concept isn't necessarily useful?

Jerry Colonna (01:05:18):
Here's what I have a problem with. First of all, having a growth mindset is a very, very helpful thing. What I have a problem is in having and how we can turn a notion like a growth mindset into a fixed mindset, which is, it's this funny little trick the ego does, and the ego says, "Okay, well, this is a growth mindset. Oh, this is not a growth mindset. Okay, then this is good. This is not good. This is bad. This is..." What Buddhism has taught me is that everything's falling apart all the time even our growth mindset. When we get too fixed on the proper way to do things, we're setting ourselves up for attachment and therefore suffering. So if you can hold something like a mindset loosely with that attachment, go for it. Have a blast. Enjoy it. But the minute you start to nail it down to the floor and say this is the way it ought to be, I ought to always have a growth mindset, you've become fixed. And that's what the ego does.

(01:06:48):
To be more explicit about it from a business context for example, the great business writer Peter Senge says, "It is virtually impossible to challenge the assumptions that made you rich in the first place." So think about it in our experience of starting a business. We have what the Zen Buddhist would say, beginner's mind, all things are possible. And then, we experience, you were talking about it a little before, a little bit of success, and the ego, which is so terrified of not having success, start to say, "Aha, this is the way to do it." And then, we start to deviate from that because life happens and then the anxiety starts. So the question is, how do you hold a growth mindset loosely knowing that you ought to stay present to the world as it is, respond to the changing dynamics, figure out what's next because that's the growth. So put succinctly, stay attached to the growth and hold mindset a little loosely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:07):
I love that. It reminds me of advice. I did a meditation retreat once, and there's always a sense with Buddhism, and it's interesting how often Buddhism and advice from Buddhist teachings comes up on this podcast by the way.

Jerry Colonna (01:08:18):
When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. You are inviting it in, but keep going.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:25):
That makes sense as you say that. Interesting. So there's this fear I think people have with Buddhist teachings that you will not be as ambitious and you will not achieve as much if you're not attaching.

Jerry Colonna (01:08:41):
If you're not anxiously chasing something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):
Yeah, exactly. If you're just like, "Why do I need that? I don't need to be the CEO of the VP because like, oh, I won't attach to that." And then, so people fear that downside. So I asked this question at this retreat and the advice they shared there was don't attach to this idea, but just point your cart in that direction and head there.

Jerry Colonna (01:09:02):
Yeah, I like that. Look, the fear you're talking about is the fear of complacency. And if we look at the structures of the mind and we look at our socialization, the way we're socialized to ward off complacency is anxiety. And so, if we go back to some of the things we were saying before, if I grow up believing that the way I'm going to make my parents love me is by achieving, then if I become complacent, then what's at risk is their love for me. So just like we made the connection before where unconditional love exists, unconditional positive regard for self, otherwise known as self-compassion can be a powerful motivator, especially when you get to the point where you say, "As painful as it is for me to write, I enjoy writing. I enjoy working out. I enjoy pushing myself. I don't necessarily enjoy it in the moment." But I certainly, when I look at two books on my desk and I say, "You know what? That feels good. That makes me happy."

(01:10:43):
To me, the ability to hold the seeming contradiction of those things is a hallmark of my adulthood. It's to get satisfaction out of hard work for me is a much greater motivator than fear of complacency. As I've sort of slip-slided my way into that place, I have found... I work seven days a week. I don't have to, but I enjoy it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):
There's another, maybe a last area I want to spend some time on, which is around teams and what often causes trouble for teams. What breaks teams? What breaks companies? You have this point, you make that it's rarely lack of talent on the team, lack of strategy, lack of execution, that it's something else. What is that something else? What often do you find as the source of the problem for teams that aren't working?

Jerry Colonna (01:11:56):
Well, it's the unresolved, I'll be dramatic with the language, demons from their childhood. It's the unsorted baggage. Here's what happens. Teams are groups, and there are group dynamics that always happen. There is the scapegoat, there is the truth-teller who has to say, "Let me tell you what's really wrong with everything going on." Without the individual's radical self-inquiry skills, groups tend to be condemned to repeating patterns oftentimes of their family of origin.

(01:12:40):
I'll tell you a quick story. There's a very famous software blogger, blogger-owned software that I coached for many years, and we were doing an executive team meeting, and something happened in the group as we were talking that I observed once, twice, and three times, and finally, I said, "Okay, guys, I'm seeing something happen here. Every time we get close to talking about something that's really painful, somebody makes a joke and all the energy disappears and everybody laughs and everybody's nice." And as soon as I said it, my client who was CEO at the time said, "Jesus Christ, that's just like my family." It was like, yes, that's just like your family.

(01:13:35):
Carl Jung once said, "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." Let's apply it here. Until you make conscious the unconscious patterns operating in the group, the group will continue to repeat those patterns and you will blame somebody in the group. Romantic relationships from a Buddhist perspective, part of what we do in romantic relationships is we find the perfect foil for us to work out our unconscious phenomena. When we join a group, when we form up in teams and organizations, we are unconsciously finding the perfect foils for us to work out our own shit. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power in the group. If that person refuses to do their work, the entire group will become a manifestation of early dysfunction in the individual's lives. Does that make any sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:59):
100%. And this comes up a number of times on this podcast, just the impact the leaders issues have on the rest of the team, and also just this idea that the conditions they're trying to avoid are the conditions they invite in because they're avoiding.

Jerry Colonna (01:15:14):
That's it. That's it. One of my favorite teachers and dear friends is Parker Palmer, and he builds on, I think it was Socrates who said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." And he builds on that and makes a joke, and he says, "But if you choose to live an unexamined life, please don't take a job that involves other people." And that's it. You have a responsibility to examine your own shit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:43):
So say you're on this team, so there's two sides of this. You're on a team, the leaders clearly got some stuff that they need to work through, but they're not. Is there something you can do there other than just, "Hey, please, this is hurting us?" And then from the leader's perspective listening to this, what should they do? Is it get a coach? What can you do?

Jerry Colonna (01:16:01):
So for the one who has less power?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:04):
Yeah.

Jerry Colonna (01:16:05):
One of the things to ask oneself is what draws me to this position in the first place? How have I been complicit, not responsible in creating the conditions I say I don't want. How have I benefited from the dysfunction that exists in this organization? And benefit is a funny word. It doesn't necessarily mean I'm making more money. It means, for example, a benefit might be, boy, this feels familiar. I always find myself working on teams that are dysfunctional in this way. What is there in that experience for me to learn? So that's one thing.

(01:16:55):
You asked about the person who has power. You were using the word leader. I will talk about power, and you threw out, well, should they get a coach? Let's put it into larger context. Should you examine your life with radical self-inquiry? Yes. I would argue that the more power you have, the more moral responsibility you have to actually pause and figure out what it is that you're doing to be complicit in creating the conditions you say you don't want.

(01:17:28):
To be a very quick example what I'm talking about. A couple of years ago, I was doing a talk at a venture firm's CEO portfolio summit, the portfolio company's CEO summit. And we're sitting in a room, and of course I'm walking around again with shoes off and whatever, and people are firing questions at me. And one woman says, "Well, I'm the CEO of this 15-person company, and I have a question for you. Why is it that nobody on my team can make a decision without me?" And I said, "Who hired them?" And she, "Well..." I said, "Okay, how does it make you feel when they make a decision that you disagree with?" She said, "I'm furious." "Well, how can you hire people whom you expect to make decisions without running them through you if you can't tolerate them making a decision that you disagree with?"

(01:18:37):
You want to build a scaled leadership team, you have to be willing to have them make boneheaded decisions. And that's really, really hard, especially if we're "in founder mode" driving all the decisions. So that's your growth edge. We were talking about before about growth mindset. That's your growth edge. How can I be with the people in my life making boneheaded decisions about something that I care so much about and what is the best way for me to be in relationship about that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):
So much of this comes back to that question we started this with of just how are you complicit in creating the conditions you don't want? A big takeaway for me here, and it just keeps coming up and again and again, is if you're struggling as a leader, if your company's not working as well as you wanted to, if you're having a hard time with your team, going back to that equation, it's not about building more skills like public speaking skills or email skills, or I don't know, financial skills. It's self-awareness, radical self-inquiry, understanding what drives you, what makes you happy. Is that generally correct?

Jerry Colonna (01:19:51):
Lenny, I was just going to say, you just made me so happy you saying what you just said. Yes. I've been coaching now, as I said for a couple of decades. Before that, I was a VC for 15, 17 years. What you just said is the wisdom of my 40 years as an adult. That's it. This is why radical self-inquiry is so damned important because it leads to a little bit less suffering and a lot more resilience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:28):
For folks that want to actually do that, well, they can rewind back to the middle of the episode where we actually ask the questions that are associated with the radical self-inquiry, and then obviously if they want to dig deeper, they can buy your book.

Jerry Colonna (01:20:41):
Or 10 copies of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:43):
Or 100 copies for everyone at the company willing to Amazon. Jerry, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think is really important for people to hear maybe as the last piece of wisdom?

Jerry Colonna (01:20:57):
Now one of the hopes that I have you ask me at the start like what would be my hope is that we ended up being closer and friends, and I feel that. Let me extend that out to everybody. What I always hope from all of these intimate conversations that I try to do in podcasts is that people walk away going, "Geez, I'm not alone." We've made different references to the fact that it's a hard time. The truth is it's always a hard time. And what makes it hardest is to feel like I'm the only one who's going through this. So what I appreciate about what you do, Lenny, is that under the guise of talking about product, you're really talking about the process of being human. And that is a mitzvah. That's a good deed. And so, I hope in the process of listening to this, people walk away going, "Okay, I feel a little bit better today."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:04):
I really appreciate that. The way I think about these sorts of conversations and episodes, I call them Trojan Horse episodes where people come for the other stuff, tactical, practical stuff, and then they get stuff they really need to hear. And so, I appreciate you. Jerry, thank you so much for being here.

Jerry Colonna (01:22:19):
Thank you for having me. It was a delight.

# The social radar: Y Combinator’s secret weapon | Jessica Livingston (co-founder of YC, author)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I want to start with a quote by someone you may know, Paul Graham, "Much of what's novel about YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't know her, you don't understand YC."

Jessica Livingston (00:00:10):
My three co-founders were deeply technical, but I would look at other things about founders. All these little social cues.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):
Your nickname was the Social Radar. Every interview, everyone always turned to you and they're like, "Jessica, what does their social radar say?"

Jessica Livingston (00:00:24):
I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? And if a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
Is there anything else along the Airbnb story that would be interesting to share?

Jessica Livingston (00:00:36):
He hated their idea, and Paul tried to get Brian and Joe and Nate to change it. But I remember specifically Joe brought out the cereal boxes, the Obama O's and Cap'n McCain's, and I just thought, oh my God, they're going to work hard to do whatever they can to make this company succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
You just talk a bit about this idea of just making shit happen, showing signs of being hustlers.

Jessica Livingston (00:00:56):
Do you sort of need that desperation. You have to burn the boat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Jessica Livingston. Jessica is the co-founder of Y Combinator, the first and most famous startup accelerator, which since 2005 has funded over 5,000 companies, including over 200 unicorns now worth over a billion dollars, including companies like Airbnb, Stripe, DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Instacart, Reddit, the list goes on. Jessica is also the author of one of the bestselling books about startups, Founders at Work, and hosts the Social Radars Podcast. She lives in England with her husband, who you may know, and her two sons. In our conversation, we dive deep into Jessica's superpower of being the Social Radar. She got this nickname in the early days of YC because she can read people incredibly well. This becomes a huge unfair advantage when you're evaluating and investing in early stage startups and founders, but also becomes useful in every part of your life. There's actually a quiz that I'm going to link to in the show notes called Reading the Mind in the Eyes that I suggest you take to see how you do, and it'll give you a sense of how well you are at reading people.

(00:02:08):
Jessica got a perfect score, just as an example of her unique talents, reading people's emotions along with her superpower and tips on how you can develop your own social radar. We also talk about her fabulous podcast called The Social Radars, some wild early YC stories, including how the interview with the Airbnb founders actually went down, and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jessica Livingston.

(00:02:45):
Jessica, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jessica Livingston (00:02:50):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm glad to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:52):
I want to start with a quote by someone you may know, Paul Graham. So he wrote, "A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on it had been a one-man show. It's sadly common to read that sort of thing, but the problem with that description is not just that it's unfair, it's also misleading. Much of what's novel about YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't know her, you don't understand YC." I'm hoping with this conversation we help a lot more people understand you. Kind of an implication of this quote that I wanted to ask you about is that there's an implication that you've never gotten the credit that you deserve for starting YC, for helping YC become what it's become. I'm just curious what that's been like for you.

Jessica Livingston (00:03:41):
It's sort of a hard question. It is true, I was one of the co-founders of Y Combinator, and yet I'm often sort of left out of news articles, Wikipedia people want to take my entry off of Wikipedia all the time. I'm not as notable and I'm sort of like, "Gosh, I'm a founder of Y Combinator, author of a best-selling book on startups. What does a girl have to do?" But it is what it is. It's the external views, and it doesn't matter to me. Do you know what I mean? People within YC know what I've done, the Y Combinator alumni know what I've done, my friends and family and people I respect in the Silicon Valley community know what I've done, most of them do. So that's fine.

(00:04:35):
But it is true, I've often been sort of erased, and in some cases it's annoying because it's a lot of people who have a certain narrative about Y Combinator that don't want me to exist, I'm maybe making that up a little bit, or the people that don't want me to be part of the narrative are the ones that think that Y Combinator, it's run by white men, only invests in white men. And gosh, if there was a woman on the founding team making choices of who to fund, that would undermine their narrative. So I think sometimes that's what happens too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):
Fascinating. Just a convenient story to tell sometimes.

(00:05:20):
This episode is brought to you by Enterpret. Enterpret unifies all of your customer interactions, from Gong calls to Zendesk tickets, to Twitter threads, to app store reviews, and makes it available for your product team.

This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams. And the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch; it's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations, or you can use an all-in-one document SDK. Most product managers will tell you, "Paperwork sucks." Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features.

(00:07:11):
For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI-powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag and drop builder, and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil.

(00:07:53):
So at YC, your nickname was the Social Radar. Your podcast is called The Social Radars. I haven't seen you talk too much about this skill anywhere else, and that's what I want to spend our time on together to better understand the skill that you've built of being this social radar. How does that sound?

Jessica Livingston (00:08:13):
I will try Lenny, I will try. I don't talk much about it because it's hard to talk about. I don't understand. It's hard to put into words exactly what it is about me, but it's true that my nickname at Y Combinator was the Social Radar. And I think it was because my three co-founders were deeply technical people, and I was not. But I would look at other things about founders. When we'd have these 10-minute interviews, I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? Do they really know about their product? Do they care? Are they going to quit their job? Or are they telling us that they are going to quit their job, but really aren't? All these little social cues that I'd try to pick up on.

(00:09:10):
And in a lot of cases, red flags about them that I'd add to the decision-making process. And so that's why they called me the Social Radar, and it just sort of stuck. And it's because I love people and the dynamics and understanding what's motivating people. I just love it and I love founder psychology, founders personalities. I am absolutely fascinated with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):
I love it. Okay, so we're going to try to unpack as much as we can with the context that you're not exactly sure if you're able to articulate exactly how this power of yours works.

Jessica Livingston (00:09:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:48):
There's this line you wrote somewhere, and Paul's written this, and other people, that every interview that you all did early on at YC, everyone always turned to you and they're like, "Jessica, what do you think? What does their social radar say?" Can you just talk a bit about that role that you played in the early days of YC of kind of seeing that side of candidates?

Jessica Livingston (00:10:06):
Well, in the early days, especially before I knew a lot, as much as I know now, about startups and founders, early on, I was learning a lot in the first few years. And in the first few years, it was just the four of us. So I would be in charge of going out telling people, "Wait here while we do the interview, come on in." I'd be in charge of the stopwatch that would time us. And I'd say, "Okay, our time's up." And it was very administrative, and I would observe. Paul, Robert and Trevor, my co-founders would be asking them all sorts of questions about their product and their technology and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I would occasionally ask questions, but I'd usually remain pretty silent. And so I don't think people even really noticed me. But I would be just watching them and sort of trying to observe as much as I could, not understanding sometimes even the technology that they were talking about. I let my co-founders do that.

(00:11:06):
And then after, we'd be talking, they'd look at me and they'd be like, "Should we fund them? Jessica, should we fund them?" And sometimes I could tell based on the conversation whether they thought that the technology was good or how they felt, and sometimes I'd say, "Absolutely we should." Or sometimes I'd say, "Guys, I'm a little nervous. Did you see how that founder interrupted the other founder and wouldn't let the other founder talk?" Because my three co-founders sometimes wouldn't notice this.

(00:11:39):
They'd be so caught up in the conversation they were having about the technology, especially Paul. Paul would get really into things. And sometimes I always tease Paul, because one of his defining qualities is that sometimes someone would have an idea that he'd get so excited about that by the end of the interview he'd be giving them ideas about how to grow their product and what they could become. And they'd sit there saying, "Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea." And then he'd say, "Fund them." And I'd say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, Paul, you can't just fund this because you love the idea. Let's take a step back and let's look. Like these two founders are working at Google and they don't say they're going to quit. That's not good." And I'd point out these things that I had observed. But I mean, we always agreed. It was very rare that we wouldn't agree on funding something. We were usually on the same page.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:33):
I see. It's interesting that you talk about these behaviors, co-founders interrupting each other, or being kind of aggressive here and there. Some people believe that's okay for founders to be like this. A lot of successful founders, Elon, for example, Steve Jobs, who are kind of assholes a lot of times, I imagine, and I've read part of the reason you thought about just the type of person is you're trying to build a specific culture in the early days of YC and you're going to be around these people. So maybe can you talk a bit about just why those elements were important to you and why'd you look for those?

Jessica Livingston (00:13:08):
I've definitely heard that Steve Jobs could be an. I've heard stories. But I think I would've funded him because he's so incredible and he was so smart and so interested in the product and knew... I'm very persuaded by people who know what they're talking about and love their product and are domain experts. But I did consciously, especially early on, less so later on, early on, I did sometimes tend to say, "I really think this person's an asshole, I do not want to fund them." And we often wouldn't. And very early on when we were just funding 10, 20, 30 startups a batch, sometimes I have been known to say, "I don't know if I can have dinner with them every week." It was that point. And I don't think we've ever regretted any of those. It didn't happen all the time, that was rare. But life's too short, and I wanted to be able to work with these founders.

(00:14:16):
And as it turns out, it was sort of important early on in weeding out explicit assholes because that was the basis of our Y Combinator community, which is now thousands of founders. Now, of course, all the founders aren't all running their company anymore, but I would say most all of the founders bring something useful and valuable to the table. So if you ask a question on Bookface, on our forum for founders, someone is going to be there to help you. And it's amazing. And that all started very early on, there was this culture of older batch mates helping newer ones, and this pay-it-forward mentality where everyone helped one another and rooted for one another and made introductions for each other. And I think it's a big part of our Y Combinator community now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:12):
So I wrote down a few of the things that you mentioned you look for, and you looked for in the early days. So let me just share a few of them and let's spend a little more time here. So you looked for, did the founders get along? Are they committed to the idea? Are they ready to quit their job? Are there any red flags? So is there anything else that you remember you spent a lot of time thinking about or looking for then or even now?

Jessica Livingston (00:15:36):
There's looking for in the application and then there's looking for in the interview, and now we have software that looks for all of the red flags in the application that I used to do by hand. In the application, I'd look for just weird things, like was there a huge gap in the equity allocation? Did one founder have 99% and one founder have 1%? That's weird. I'd want to dig in on that. That doesn't feel right. Are they going to quit their job? Are they going to move to Silicon Valley? What are their current shareholders? Is like 90% of their company already owned by someone else? There all these weird things that we like to just flag. And we wouldn't necessarily not fund someone because of them, but it's just more data. So that was in the application that I'd look through all of those.

(00:16:33):
But in the interview I definitely was sort of, one thing I remember I would always look for was, when you'd have a conversation with us, a lot of times, Paul especially, but Robert and Trevor, would really be getting right into the idea and questioning you, and how do you know this? And what about this? And if a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign, always a bad sign. The best founders would say, "Gosh, I have thought about it and here's what I figured out." Or, they just have this almost a tennis match and a conversation rather than closing up and feeling like, oh, this person's interrogating me. You could just sort of, the open-mindedness, the flexible-mindedness of people was really important. I'd get really excited about domain expertise. Like my co-founders, we all loved that. If someone was fixing their own problem in a broken industry, we loved that.

(00:17:39):
Definitely, I'd look for co-founder relationships. And again, I'm not saying I was always right, but you could tell if... One founder, I'll give a story, one founder, once we asked a question and one person started to respond and the other founder put his arm in front of him and said, "I'll answer that question." And it was just so weird that he wouldn't let his co-founder speak. We'd have situations where we'd call people like hackers in a cage, where it's kind of obvious there'd be a business founder, business person, who had clearly convinced a programmer to join the team. They were given, the programmer was given, very little equity and just we called them programmers in a cage, like hackers in a cage. And sometimes that works out, I'm not saying it doesn't. But I'd always try to observe, okay, does this hacker in a cage have any say in the company, the direction of the product? That sort of thing. Because the programmer needs to have opinions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:50):
It's so funny. I love this metaphor. And I totally get what you mean. I want to unpack a couple of these, because this is exactly where I was hoping we'd go. So this idea of looking for defensiveness and being open to change and being flexible, why do you think that was so important to successful founders? Why did you look for that? Why was that a predictor of success?

Jessica Livingston (00:19:10):
Several things. First of all, being defensive is really bad, if you're a startup founder, because you're always going to get people who question you. And it's your job to educate them, if it's a new area, you're doing something presumably pretty new, you're always going to have people who question it or say, "That product's already out there, why is yours better?" You have to educate them. You don't want to be defensive about it. Also, a lot of times, the first idea isn't bang right on, the right idea, and you have to be open-minded and maybe adjust it in a certain direction. The famous PayPal story, how it started off being the PalmPilot, or money transfer. And money transfer between the PalmPilots or whatever. And then all the customers were using a janky version on the web, and they were begging for this to be on the web. And finally, the founder said, "Oh, I see what most people want this for." You have to be open-minded to see what direction really is what your users want. And so if you find someone is defensive, usually they're not open-minded.

(00:20:26):
The other thing is that the best founders will want to learn from other people and listen to other people. You talk to the Collison brothers and say something, they ask you a question, they're listening to your answer. So many founders think, oh, I can't learn from anyone. But the best founders are always listening and having spirited debates about things. I mean, that's part of the process. And so I think when someone's defensive, it's just a bad sign. So I would look for that.

(00:21:01):
I loved when I'd find someone sort of showcase that they'd make something happen no matter what; they're scrappy, they're hustlers. I remember... Can I tell the story about the Airbnb interview?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:17):
Please.

Jessica Livingston (00:21:17):
Okay, because that was definitely one I'll never forget. That was one that was clear the founders were really good. The market had just crashed basically with all the banks going out of business and everything. And so we were only funding startups that we felt had really scrappy founders and could be cockroaches, meaning could live off of very little amounts of money, or could charge customers and make money. And we didn't fund that many people in that winter '09 batch. So we're being very strict with ourselves, very disciplined about things. And the Airbnb guys came in, and I just remember they had a contagious amount of energy. They just had an energy about them the way that they talked about their product, which was crazy at the time, staying in someone's bed or airbed. In fact, it's a famous part of the story, we hated their idea and Paul tried to get Brian and Joe and Nate to change it. So we didn't even like the idea. But I remember specifically they brought, at the end, Joe brought out these, the cereal boxes, the Obama O's and Cap'n Crunch's or Cap'n McCain's or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:33):
Cap'n McCain's, yeah.

Jessica Livingston (00:22:34):
Yeah, Cap'n McCain's. They were saying that they went to some Costco or something and bought off-brand Cheerios and off-brand Cap'n Crunch's, took them out of the box, put them in this new box, glue-gunned it shut. And I just thought, oh my God, these guys are really going to great lengths for this. And for some reason, it was silly, but it really appealed to me. They're going to work hard to do whatever they can to make this company succeed. And even though we were skeptical about the idea, I think we definitely made the right bet on the founders, and it was just very clear in that interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:17):
I'm so happy you shared that story, I was definitely going to ask about it. It's so funny because I've heard that story at least a hundred times working at Airbnb, they tell the beginning of Airbnb every chance they get at every all-hands. It's like a recurring theme. And it's great to hear that basically it went exactly the way they describe. Oftentimes, there's a myth around what happened, but that's exactly how they describe it.

Jessica Livingston (00:23:41):
No, it was definitely a whole crazy story and how Paul called them to accept them, and they were on the 280 or something or the 101 and the reception went down. And so he didn't hear if they were accepted or not. Did he tell that part?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:58):
No, I haven't heard that part.

Jessica Livingston (00:23:58):
Oh yeah, that's part of the story. And they had to keep driving to get to talk to Paul again and find out that they were accepted. Oh, yeah. It was just a crazy interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
The element of the story I'm also curious about is, the way Joe tells it, is he had the box in his backpack. And as they were walking out, Paul or you is like, "Hey, what's that? What's that cereal box doing there?" Is that how it went, or is it more like, "Hey, we have this cereal thing."?

Jessica Livingston (00:24:24):
I don't think Paul and I looked in his backpack and asked. I think there was definitely some pressure on Joe not to show us the cereal boxes. I think Nate was really down on that, especially. And I think they were walking out the door and they're like, "Hey, we just brought you a little something." I think Joe did pull it out, and we had an extra minute or so around the cereal boxes. That's how I heard about the glue gun story and everything. But I think Joe had been reluctant, but he did it at the end and I think it was a good call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
That's so funny. And after that meeting, what was that conversation like between you and Paul? Was it just like everyone's like, "We definitely got to do this."? Or was it like you being like, "Hey, these guys are really interesting."?

Jessica Livingston (00:25:10):
No, I think we all liked them. We all liked them. But I remember saying, "We have got to..." I just remember being like, "We've got to fund these guys. I don't know about the idea. Maybe they'll change their idea, who knows? But they seem really great." Again, the energy level and the passion with which they spoke about their experience hosting, because they'd been around struggling, but had been a company with an idea for a little while before they applied to YC. We were there basically their Hail Mary, their last resort for them. And so they could tell us about their story about how they hosted the people at a conference, and there was definitely some magic to it, which was convincing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:57):
Is there anything else along the Airbnb story that would be interesting to share while we're on that topic?

Jessica Livingston (00:26:01):
I mean, the only interesting thing as it relates to being the social radar is that there were just some interviews that I remember because I just thought, this is great. These founders are so good. I'm totally convinced. What they're working on might not work, but I feel like it's so worth the bet based on these founders. And that happened. There were definitely a couple other of our most successful companies that I clearly felt that way about. You just feel like they know what they're talking about, they thought about the problem. They're not solving this problem because it's sort of the problem du jour or fun and exciting. Some are very unsexy problems like when Parker Conrad applied with Zenefits, unsexy HR stuff, benefits stuff. But he knew how broken it was and was trying to fix it. And I love stories like that. There was one story in terms of... The one time I did sort of persuade the rest of the group to fund someone was, do you know the company GOAT, the sneaker?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:13):
Absolutely.

Jessica Livingston (00:27:13):
Okay. When Eddie and Daishin applied, they were not doing the sneaker company, they were doing this group sort of book-a-group-dinner at a restaurant with people you don't know as a way to meet new people. And for some reason, I loved the idea because I thought maybe it could be a secret dating, like a Trojan Horse for a dating sort of site. But I really loved the two founders. And one of the reasons, again, they had this passion about their idea, but they had had this cream puff company before that they had run, and they just told these stories about how hard it was and all this stuff. And I, for some reason, just thought, these are hustlers. These guys are scrappy. They're going to make this succeed. And they didn't make that company succeed, but they pivoted and made GOAT succeed and it's doing really, really well. And I remember that one I definitely had to convince... I mean, not that Paul, Robert and Trevor didn't like them, but I think they really didn't think the idea was that great or just sort of were meh. I was like, "We have to fund them."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:24):
I love sharing these stories. If you have more to share, please keep throwing them out there.

(00:28:27):
So a few things I've noted so far, of things that you look for, and I think it's important to note this is very early stage evaluation where the founder and the team is, it's incredibly important, because the idea often shifts.

Jessica Livingston (00:28:42):
Oh, yeah. This is as early as it gets, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:43):
Yeah. Oftentimes, just an idea, I imagine.

Jessica Livingston (00:28:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:48):
So a few things, so far, things that you found to be really valuable to look for. One is this idea of just making shit happen, showing signs of being hustlers, just getting shit done, Obama O's, things like that. And then I think along the same lines, just passion for this idea and just like almost charisma. Is that how you think about it? Or is it just like...

Jessica Livingston (00:29:11):
I hate using the word charisma because there are a lot of charismatic people who are full of baloney, and are just doing a startup because it's a cool thing to do now. And I wouldn't want anyone to get fooled by charisma. There has to be some substance behind that charisma. Of course, we all love talking to more charismatic people than less, and I've certainly talked to my fair share of totally uncharismatic people, but sometimes they're really good founders too. If they know what they're doing and care about the user and are fixing a problem that they have a deep connection to. So I don't want to say someone who's charismatic, but it definitely helps because, as you know, as a founder, you have to do a lot of sales and you have to recruit people and you have to convince investors to fund you and you have to convince users to use your product and all of this stuff. So it does help being charismatic, definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:19):
Okay. So there's being super hustler, making shit happen. Domain expertise, something you've mentioned a few times. Just like having deep domain expertise in an area, and I think that's probably where they probably don't pivot oftentimes, where they've actually have experience in that specific problem.

Jessica Livingston (00:30:33):
They might pivot a little bit, they might pivot a little in terms of the actual solution. They might be trying to solve a problem and the first attempt doesn't really work. I haven't mentioned earnestness though.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Oh, do tell.

Jessica Livingston (00:30:47):
Earnestness is one of the most important because earnest, sort of to me, is bucketed with authenticity. And to be a successful startup founder, you have to care so much about the problem you're trying to solve, the users you're serving and being earnest about it is so key to success. There are so many wannabe founders, so many people doing it because it's cool or they think this idea is cool, but they don't really, deep down, have what it takes. And I think we always try to fund earnest people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:30):
What does earnest look like in practice? And how does that come across?

Jessica Livingston (00:31:33):
I think it means being sort of humble about... And if you get asked a question in the interview and you don't know the answer, they say, "I don't know the answer to that. I'd have to think about it." Or, "I don't know the answer. I've given it some thought and here's what I have come up with." And they're just honest about things, and they're not trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors thing, which we've definitely gotten people like that, that avoid the question or are doing it for the wrong reasons.

(00:32:08):
I remember there was one group that were 45-year-old men and they were building an app for teenagers in fashion. And I remember just thinking, we were asking them, "Why have you chosen teenagers in fashion?" And it was so clear that they thought they could make easy money, and it wasn't because they cared about fashion. It wasn't because, "Oh, I have a daughter who's really into fashion and I've seen this need." It was just like, they made up the idea. And that is not earnest, that is not authentic to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:47):
You talked about it, so there's this earnestness you look for, also not being defensive. There's this also spectrum of confidence and people believing in what they're doing. Do you have any thoughts on just how to find that? What does that look like when they're too defensive versus they're just confident and then they know what they're talking about?

Jessica Livingston (00:33:03):
Confidence is good. You definitely want confidence. It's hard to... I think you can see it when you experience it. Like someone who's confident in answering your questions but isn't defensive, there's definitely a difference. And I don't know, this is why I'm saying it's sort of hard to articulate these things, but confidence means you can say, "I've thought about that and I don't know the answer." That's confidence. And they'll say, "But here's what I do to try to figure it out. Here are my plans to address that." Confidence, I should have put that upfront because that's very important, especially when it comes to fundraising, you cannot go into an investor meeting lacking confidence. You can come into YC's interview lacking confidence, but we will then help you in the next three months to gain more confidence.

(00:33:58):
And by the way, one of the things we do to help people gain more confidence is to make them believe that their startup is a great investment, to help them create a startup that truly is possibly going to make money or at least worth being a good bet. That's the thing, early stage, the best you can offer is like, "I might not succeed, but I'm definitely a good bet." And we help them with their product, we help them with their ideas, and we help them that, by demo day, they can get up on stage and legitimately say, "We're a good bet and here's why. Let me tell you about our idea." And so we definitely help with confidence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:43):
Awesome. A couple other things you mentioned earlier, just to unpack a little bit. So being committed, something you look for, and co-founders getting along. In terms of committed, I imagine, these are very practical things. How are they actually going to stick to this? Are they actually excited to work on this? Maybe talk about that a little bit.

Jessica Livingston (00:35:00):
We all know how hard startups are, but I think you don't really know how hard it is until you actually do it. A lot of people would start a startup still having a job at Google or wherever, and they do it on the side. I do recommend, if people are just getting started and don't want to raise money yet, starting it on the side is a great way to get going, but at some point you have to commit, you have to burn the boat, because we found that founders who were still getting a paycheck and health insurance, once the going got tough, they did not quit their job. And you sort of need that desperation like, "I have to make this startup succeed because it's my job." Not like, "Oh, I'll just stay at Google." You need that. And we found that founders who weren't leaving their jobs, it was just not working out. Or that co-founder would always wind up leaving the company because they didn't want to actually leave their job.

(00:36:01):
And that's fine, there are people that can't leave their jobs for financial reasons. That's fine. You just shouldn't be starting a startup if you're not going to be prepared to leave your job. So that's the leaving of the job thing. And the co-founders getting along, oh my. I spent a lot of my time at Y Combinator when I was there all the time, full time, mediating co-founder disputes. And so many startups died or had near-death experiences because the co-founders didn't get along or broke up. It just happens all the time. And so that's why I think, during interviews, I was desperately trying to search for any clues that the co-founders didn't get along, or if they blatantly contradicted each other. But you could also tell if they were answering, finishing each other's sentences.

(00:36:59):
I love co-founders that have a history together; either they went to school together, they went to college together, work together, maybe they're siblings. Because when you have a long-term relationship, you trust each other and you know each other's weaknesses, and you're usually on the same page with your aspirations and everything. It's really scary when two founders get together just to start the startup and don't have any history. Massive red flag. Sometimes it works out like in the case of Dropbox, Drew and Arash both went to MIT, but I think they didn't know each other before they started Dropbox, and it worked out. But most of the time it doesn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:46):
So we've talked about co-founders getting along, looking for defensiveness, domain expertise, the sign of making shit happen, earnestness. Is there anything else that we've missed that you look for in the founders that tell you maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't?

Jessica Livingston (00:38:02):
Relentlessly resourceful. Paul wrote a whole essay on that. Every founder is different, I never try to say, "Oh, this person doesn't have this. I'm not going to fund them." You always have to... Everyone's different. But I mean, you're an investor. I'm curious, do any of these things surprise you or do you care about these things too?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):
No, absolutely not. Absolutely. And I actually try to avoid pre-seed and early stage because I'm not amazing at it, maybe. This is why I want to learn how to build my social radar skill.

Jessica Livingston (00:38:37):
Oh gosh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:38):
Yeah. Tough. It's so tough. It's like so few things actually work out.

Jessica Livingston (00:38:42):
Well, it's because you don't have a lot of data. If someone is just applying with an idea, you have very little data. You can look at where they went to college, what have they built in the past, that's always a great predictor of their ability. And so on the YC's application, we ask them, "What project have you worked on before?" Or whatever. But it's really hard to tell when you're the first investor.

(00:40:00):
When did you first notice that you had this social radar-ish skill and you're better at this than other people?

Jessica Livingston (00:40:08):
Paul used to always call me Detective Livingston. Before I was a social radar, I was Detective Livingston. I cannot help myself noticing weird things, just dumb things, like if Paul had on a yellow T-shirt and then an hour later came in with a blue T-shirt, I'd be like, "Why do you have a blue T-shirt on?" I have to understand what happened in that hour where that T-shirt is different. Or people's what, their relationships, what drives them? I was always like this, and I think it goes back to my childhood.

(00:40:44):
I spent hours and hours on the phone with people, with my girlfriends, dissecting situations, and then all through high school, and college, I mean the amount of time we wasted discussing social matters with people, and boys, and things like that. It was just frightening how much time I wasted, but I just was genuinely interested in it. And what drives people and why did this happen? I don't know if I ever noticed I did this, but it was just, my point is, it's always been a part of me. And I definitely notice and having an aversion to phony people. I always have. I've never been one to fall for someone who's super phony and tried to have them as a friend or anything. I just can tell, and ugh, I hate it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:34):
Do you feel like it's almost all genetic or do you think there was something in your childhood that pushed you to be good at this?

Jessica Livingston (00:41:42):
I don't know. I really don't know. So this is why I think I'm going to be a bad guest, because I can't give a practical understanding. I mean, I don't really think... I can't say other people in my family are like that, and I can't say that it was part of my upbringing. I just notice these things. I don't know. I should be paying attention to other things, but I'm not, but I'm paying attention to this. I'll give you an example with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):
Please.

Jessica Livingston (00:42:13):
So I looked up your bio to read a little bit about you, and I loved the Dalton Caldwell Podcast. I listened to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:23):
Fourth most popular of all time.

Jessica Livingston (00:42:26):
Dalton's was?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:27):
Yes.

Jessica Livingston (00:42:28):
Oh, go Dalton. That's awesome. Yeah, it was really good. I learned a lot from it. I love listening to Dalton. But what I really want to know about you is, on the release that you sent, or on the instructions for this podcast, you said, "There might be some edge cases where your podcast isn't good enough to go out. We just want to warn you." And all I could think of is, what prompted that? There has to be a story of what prompted that. No one else would pay attention to that, but I'm just so curious. It's so weird. I'm just a weird person like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:07):
Yes, I did add that. There's a story, basically, it was just an episode that wasn't amazing and we didn't have that caveat in the prep beforehand, and it felt bad to tell the person.

Jessica Livingston (00:43:19):
See, I knew it. I knew that that had happened.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:23):
That's exactly right. Is there kind of a way you've thought about honing this skill over time? Once you kind of got a sense, "Hey, people keep telling me I'm really good at this." Is there something you've done to help strengthen it?

Jessica Livingston (00:43:35):
No, but one of the things I do try to do is sort of reinforce. Sometimes I'll have a feeling about someone, maybe we fund them, maybe we don't. I'd sort of like to know what happens a few years later. I like to follow up. There definitely have been some situations where I haven't liked someone that we funded and it's taken 5 to 10 years before they failed. And in some cases, for a bad reason. Where I'll say, "Oh, thank God, I was right about that. I did have this feeling." Or, "I knew they'd be successful." Like the GOAT guys who I was saying before, there was definitely a period when Grubwithus, their first startup wasn't doing well, and they were starting, that maybe some people would've given up on them. And now I can say, "I was right about them. That feeling was right."

(00:44:35):
So I do try to sort of follow up with some of the really strong gut instincts that I had, to see if I was right. Often, when I have a gut instinct, it's like a negative thing. So we wind up not funding someone. So I really need to know if that person went on to be super successful. And I will answer your question right now, there's no one that I had a strong dislike for that I sort of said, "We should not fund them," that has gone on to be a super success. Thank God.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
Wow, interesting.

Jessica Livingston (00:45:12):
I mean, it doesn't happen all the time that I really put my foot down, but sometimes I have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
And this feeling, is it like a visceral body thing for you? Or is it like intellectually, you notice, "Hey, this guy's interrupting her and this person doesn't..."?

Jessica Livingston (00:45:26):
More intellectual. But it does come from inside. I don't know how to hone it. It has to come naturally. You have to have a natural interest in people. And so I'm sometimes not listening to all the words and I'm sort of just observing them, I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):
Have you ever been tricked by someone where you didn't see something you should have seen? Is there anything there?

Jessica Livingston (00:45:52):
Oh, yeah, for sure. I can't really talk about the times I have been tricked just because I don't want to say anything really negative about people, but... Well, there was one example that I do feel comfortable sharing. Ilya Lichtenstein of MixRank. Do you know the guy that stole billions of dollars in Bitcoin from a crypto wallet? Do you not know this crazy, crazy story?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):
Please share.

Jessica Livingston (00:46:21):
I think he's in the joint now. He was definitely convicted of this, and his wife, and they stole billions of dollars. And I definitely don't remember thinking anything bad about him or thinking he could be that kind of person. So that definitely, there've been some doozies like that, where, did not see that one coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:48):
Oh my God. I think what's extraordinary about the fact that that happens rarely is that your interviews are 10 minutes long, and so you have very little time to actually find all these things. And plus, the actual product and the idea and growth strategy and all these things.

Jessica Livingston (00:47:04):
Well, you find a lot can come in reading the application. That's a lot of legwork at the beginning. You read the application. But then the 10 minutes is kind of as long as you need, in most cases. Because we found when they were longer, like 20 minutes, you'd know in 10 minutes and be twiddling your thumbs trying to get through the interview for the next 10 minutes. So we kept them short so we could interview more people. But there have definitely been cases where we've interviewed people, accepted them, and then very soon afterward, we're sort of like, crestfallen like, "Oh, these people are very limp. What were we thinking?" Definitely, we've been tricked in that respect all the time. Or, "Oh gosh, they seem so impressive in the interview and now they're just posers who can't really do anything." Definitely, I'm tricked all the time in little ways. Or, I didn't notice two founders didn't get along and then one co-founder goes missing a week into the program or something crazy. There's all sorts of crazy stuff like that that happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:14):
I think in the game you're playing, I would expect some things to slip through.

Jessica Livingston (00:48:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):
You said that there's been kind of an operationalization of some of the things you used to look for in founders, now that you're not actually in the process. Is there a Jessica-as-a-service sort of thing? What kind of stuff have they built that looks for the sorts of things you used to look for in the interview process?

Jessica Livingston (00:48:38):
No, it's all just stuff in application that automatically flags certain things. I actually don't remember all of them, but it's just, all it is, is a, "Please pay attention to this, reader of the application." It's not, "This disqualifies anyone." It's, "Just please pay attention." And those are things like I mentioned, a really crazy equity structure, founders not quitting their job, things like that, that it's important that someone is voting on them and then interviewing them knows. Because I would often, some of the questions I'd ask at the end of the interview, I'd say, "It looks like you have 90% of the stock and your co-founder only has one. Can you tell us why that's the case?" And maybe they could make a case for it, who knows? But at least I'd ask. So the flags just say, "Pay attention to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:37):
Amazing. So if we were to zoom out, in early stage investing, the main thing you need to get right and evaluate as the founder, the social radar skill that you've had from childhood is such an incredible advantage in doing this well, and you could basically say YC is what it is because of this unfair advantage that you all had in the early days. I'm guessing many people listening to this are like, "We need a Jessica on our team. We need to build this skill ourselves. We need to figure out how to integrate social radar into our process." I know you're going to hate this question, but just, do you have any advice for people that want to try to build the skill, get better at this, notice some of these things?

Jessica Livingston (00:50:20):
I really think that our advantage was that my three co-founders were deeply technical people. And I think a lot of investors back then weren't, didn't have that background. And I think that that background really helped YC choose good founders. So I don't want to make it sound like it was that big of a deal, but advice? Advice for how to hone... I mean, I think just try to pay attention to subtle cues. If you really feel like, gosh, I'm so clueless about these things, try to just tell yourself, "Okay, I'm going in to evaluate these founders, evaluate this investment opportunity. I know I'm bad at these kind of judgments. I'm going to remember, do they seem like they get along?" Because there are no trick questions. I don't have any trick questions that you could ask, or it's just paying attention. Have a conversation.

(00:51:26):
Do they understand their product well? Are they defensive? Maybe have your own little checklist that you think about. You don't have to have it written down, but you think about, and then afterward, you spend some time thinking, were they defensive? When I asked them why this is better than the competitor, how did that go? Or ask them, maybe do have some questions, if you don't know how long they've known each other, ask them that question. "How did you two meet? Have you ever worked together before? How's it going?" Just be a little bit more conscious about asking these types of questions to reveal some key information for your investment decision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:09):
That was an awesome summary of a lot of the stuff we talked about. If anyone ever doubts that you are very good at this, Paul tweeted this quiz, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes quiz, that I took, it's incredibly hard. You basically see a bunch of eyes and you're supposed to judge their emotion, and it's really hard. And you got 36 out of 36, which blows my mind.

Jessica Livingston (00:52:33):
I did nail it. I do have to tell a funny story about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):
Please.

Jessica Livingston (00:52:36):
So Paul, sort of late at night, and he emailed me, because I had gone to bed, but I had my thing, and he emailed me. He's like, "Check out this quiz. I got 25 out of 36. What can you get?" So I got my computer out because I was like, I have to beat Paul. And I did it, and it was really hard. They'd only show the eyes and then it would say, what is this person thinking? Are they happy, sad? But some of them were really hard to distinguish. Are they irritated or are they angry? It's kind of hard to tell the difference between irritated and angry. And I remember looking into these people's eyes saying, "What are they trying to communicate to me? Are they irritated with me or are they mad at me?" Kind of thing.

(00:53:24):
And as I went through, it would tell you if you got it correct. As I almost got to the end, I was like, "Oh my God, this is going to be a near-perfect score. I have to nail this." And when I got 36 out of 36, I was like, "Yes." And I told Paul, he tweeted it. We then, a week later, had this YC event in London, and I swear to God, about 10 people came up to me to talk about this eye quiz and how they had not done well, and what was my secret? It was very amusing. I never thought that anyone would think it was that interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:59):
I love that there's this thing that totally shows this skill you have that is better than everyone else. I took it, all my friends have taken it after that tweet, and the highest we've gotten is 31 of all the people I know.

Jessica Livingston (00:54:11):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:12):
And I think when people take it, we'll link to it, they're going to be like, "How can you get 36 out of 36? Impossible."

Jessica Livingston (00:54:19):
You have to look into their eyes and say, "What are they trying to tell me?" I hope you're not trying to tell me you're full of shit with your eyes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:28):
I'm feeling despondent. Just kidding. That's one of the options. I'm like, "What does that even mean?"

Jessica Livingston (00:54:32):
I know. Well, that's the other thing I told Paul, also the challenge is, you really have to understand what each feeling, what that word means. He's like, "Oh, that didn't even occur to me." Because he's such a word person and knows the exact definition of every single word. But I thought some people will struggle understanding the complexities of the emotion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:55):
With the words, I almost felt like I had to do what you did where just like, "What does this word feel like when I'm reading it? Despondent, let's see if these eyes are despondent." I love that trick you shared. So basically you looked at the eyes and you're like, "What is this person trying to tell me?"

Jessica Livingston (00:55:09):
Yeah, that's the best I could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):
Amazing. So we're going to link to that quiz. I'm curious what people, if you take it, please leave your score in the comments, see if anyone can get anywhere near Jessica's score. Okay. So speaking of social radar-ing, you have a podcast called The Social Radars.

Jessica Livingston (00:55:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):
Let's talk about it.

Jessica Livingston (00:55:27):
Yes, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:28):
First of all, just why did you decide to start a podcast? There's a lot of podcasts in the world. What made you decide to start one?

Jessica Livingston (00:55:32):
Well, I'm really excited that you're asking that question because no one has ever asked me about The Social Radars. Yes, I mean, it's pretty new, but we launched last year. I decided to start The Social Radars because I live off in the English countryside, not really as connected as I'd like to be with Silicon Valley, partly by choice, but I do miss it a lot. And I was finding that as I was catching up with YC alumni that would come visit or I'd see, I just loved the conversations we were having, and I missed that. I missed that connection with these people, and sort of sharing their stories of triumph and failure in some cases, but mostly triumph. At the same time, I became obsessed with this podcast called SmartLess. Have you ever heard of it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):
I've heard of it, haven't listened.

Jessica Livingston (00:56:21):
Okay. So just for the listeners, it is a podcast hosted by three actors; Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. And they invite Hollywood people, actors, directors, musicians, sometimes athletes, on the show. And the thing is, one person, one of the hosts invites the guests, the other two don't know. So there's no preparation, and it's the most fascinating thing. I love movies and I love television, and I can tell you another weird eccentric gift of mine is I remember every name in Hollywood and know all their children and all this stuff because I've been reading People Magazine since I was 13. So I loved, you'd learn so much about the actors as people because they weren't talking from a script or their media messages for promoting a movie. It was like just genuine conversations. Most of the time these actors knew the people and were friends, and I just found it fascinating. I could not stop.

(00:57:25):
And I thought there should be a really informal conversation like this with startup founders so people could understand the people behind the startups. And it's not too scripted and not too, maybe, I don't want to say professional, because I hope it's professional sounding, but it's very conversational and authentic. I was trying to mimic that a little bit. I convinced my colleague and friend, Carolynn Levy, who of course has a full-time job being one of the amazing lawyers within YC, and she's super busy. I convinced her to do it with me so I could have a partner in crime. And then we just started and I said, "We'll do a few episodes, see how it goes, and we'll keep going if it's fun." And I have had so much fun catching up with all the people I've interviewed. At this point, I forget how many podcasts I've even done, but maybe-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:24):
I think about 27-ish.

Jessica Livingston (00:58:26):
27 that have launched yet, and there's a few coming out. Season three, we're still in the middle of that, and still editing some and doing some. But it's been so much fun and I love it, and I hope that people enjoy listening. I hope I'm not just working this really small corner of the room. I hope people enjoy unstructured conversations. But people open up to me though, because what I copied from SmartLess that I liked, they'd say, "Hey, remember when we were at that Oscars party and this happened..." Because they had that relationship with the people they're interviewing, in a lot of cases, I feel like I've had that with a lot of people I'm interviewing and I could say, "Hey, Brian, remember when you interviewed and brought the cereal boxes?" And he could tell, he shared that story. I don't think I knew it before then that they were on the 101 and the phone went out, the reception went out before Paul said that they were accepted. So I learn a lot, and it's really just fascinating to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:27):
Well, it's an awesome podcast, I've been listening. I'm going to just read some of the guests that you've had on, just so people get a sense of who you're interviewing. So you actually just had Paul Graham on the podcast. He does very few podcast episodes. So that's an unfair advantage you have there. Patrick and John Collison, Brian Chesky, you mentioned Brian Armstrong, Emmett Shear, Tony Xu, like epic people.

Jessica Livingston (00:59:48):
Emmett Shear, by the way, the week after he was named OpenAI CEO for like 72 hours, that one launched. I was like, I could not have planned that timing better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:58):
Is there an episode you'd recommend people start with if they were start to explore your podcast and get into it?

Jessica Livingston (01:00:04):
Honestly, I truly believe this, I'm not BS-ing you, I think they're all really, really good, and there's so many interesting takeaways from every single one. If I were coming to it for the first time, I'd probably choose, I'd look at the guests and say, "Who am I interested in? Have I stayed at an Airbnb and I want to learn more about that?" Or, "Do I use Reddit?" Just see who the guests are and start with someone you're kind of interested in, and I guarantee you'll learn more about this person.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
So across the podcast episodes you've done, I hate when people ask me this question, but I'm going to ask you this question. Is there any big lessons you've learned, any stories that have stuck with you? Any takeaways so far from interviewing all these incredibly successful founders and people?

Jessica Livingston (01:00:48):
My God, I love that question. I don't hate that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:48):
Okay, I'm glad.

Jessica Livingston (01:00:52):
I could talk for an hour just on... I want to learn from you as an expert podcaster, because I'm still a noob here. What I've learned the hard way, and you probably will nod your head when I say this, is that I talk way too much. I'm a huge windbag and I hate... I don't notice it now when I'm just talking to you and going off and talking, talking, talking. But when I'm editing the podcast and I'm listening to myself ask a question in 20 sentences when I could ask it in two. So I've really had to train myself to keep things short. You want regular short dialogue, you know this, but you also have to interrupt guests if they're going off too much. So the talking of the hosts should be frequent but short. That's the lesson that I've learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:52):
Totally agree.

Jessica Livingston (01:01:46):
In terms of content, every single episode is a gem in its own right, and there aren't massive lessons because they're all sort of specific to that person, and I never know exactly which direction we're going to go in when we get into things. But it was interesting. There were definitely some themes with Adora Cheung and Tony Xu of DoorDash where they said they really made a mistake early on scaling into different cities before they had nailed the original city. And that's an important lesson. There's lessons for everyone, I think. In addition to really getting to know these founders, their personal side of their personality, there's some great lessons that they all tell.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
I love these lessons. Is there anything else you've learned about interviewing? That's something I'm always trying to get better at. I love this point you made. I say the same thing to every podcaster. You talk too much as a host, you should let the guest talk. Just ask the question and let them talk. Is there anything else that you've learned about just how to interview more effectively?

Jessica Livingston (01:02:54):
Remember, I've been interviewing people since YC started because I was working on Founders at Work simultaneously when we started YC, and so that was a collection of interviews. And back then, I can't say I was that good at it. I've gotten much better. And then I've since gone, I used to do a lot of interviews at startup school on stage with people, and now the podcast. I think one thing that is that the guests trust me. They trust that I'm not going to try to have a gotcha moment. I'm not trying to lure them into saying anything controversial. Do I love it when they say something that hasn't been said before? Yes. But I'm not trying to trick them.

(01:03:37):
And just like you, I tell them, "You will have a chance to review this before it goes public." And I think that disarms people and they say, "Okay, I can open up because I know if I regret saying something, it's not like talking to a reporter who's going to publish it." I care about them. I care about making them look good, and I'd never want to betray their trust, and they know that. So that's part of it too. For me, with the podcast, I have some questions that I do ahead of time just so I have something down, but I also just let the conversation go where it's going, and we get into some random tangents that I find are really fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:26):
Is there a story that stand out to you just that sticks with you from the interviews that just like, "Wow, that was such an incredible story someone shared with me," or, "a lesson learnt."?

Jessica Livingston (01:04:29):
The podcast that really sticks with me is the Parker Conrad episode, of Rippling, but we spent a lot of time on Zenefits because if you didn't follow that story years ago, the press annihilated him. And in talking to him, I learned why. There was a smear campaign paid for by someone still at Zenefits. There were legal threats made to force him to sign this legal document that would allow them to have a non-compete in California so that he couldn't another company, basically making his life miserable, disparaging him. Stories planted in the press. And I had him come on and I had him tell what really happened.

(01:05:29):
And even I, who have seen so much shit behind the scenes with startups in Silicon Valley over the years, stuff you just couldn't believe. This was unbelievable. And the thing that really sticks with me is that no reporter ever, maybe no reporters listened to it, but no one said, "Hey, I got that wrong years ago. I shouldn't have written that. That wasn't true. Let me set the record straight." So he doesn't care. Parker's moved on, he's successful with Rippling, he doesn't think about this stuff. But I do. I care about justice. And it was a horrible thing that was done to him and it affected his health, it affected his life, and I just am glad to have sort of been a conduit to set the record straight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:24):
That's an awesome episode maybe for people to start with if they want to check out the podcast. And then generally, I just love this rise of ways for tech people to share their story without this drive to create clicks and create gotcha moments and things like that. Just this, I think people call it techno optimism, this idea of just like tech is great, technology is doing great things for us, let's just tell these stories in a really positive way versus look at all the harm they're causing, technology stop, slow it down.

Jessica Livingston (01:06:50):
And I just want to have conversations that I personally find interesting. I'm very selfish about it, Lenny. As long as I have an interesting conversation, I tell Carolyn this all the time, as long as we have 20 listeners, that's all I need. 20 really interested listeners, we'll keep doing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:10):
I love that attitude. I wish I had that same feeling. What I look for is, is it growing? That's the thing. I'm like, is it growing at least? If it's growing, no matter what it is, I'm feeling good.

Jessica Livingston (01:07:20):
I need to be a little bit more like that. I don't know any of my statistics. What statistic, you tell me as an experience podcaster, what statistics should I have taped up to my mirror every day and track?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):
There's the correct one and there's a simple one that I look at, which is just downloads of the episode. It's the most basic one you see everywhere. And downloads is a weird one because they might download and not listen to it, but that's just the one that podcast platforms tell you how many people have downloaded it. And that's the one that just tells you generally, are people listening? Are people continuing to listen? Did they remove it from their phone? In theory, you should be looking at retention like how many people are finishing the podcast episode?

Jessica Livingston (01:08:02):
Can you tell that though? I thought these platforms don't share that with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):
Some do, some do. Spotify gives you some of that. Apple, gives you. The worst part about podcasting is the analytics are extremely bad and inconsistent, but there are some of those stats. The other one, okay, here's one to pay attention to, is number of subscribers on the different platforms, people that follow you. That actually is a really important metric to watch.

Jessica Livingston (01:08:26):
Number of subscribers, okay. One thing I also, this is just my personality, I can't bring myself to do what I want to, is ask people if you like The Social Radars, please subscribe and leave a rating and a review. I would do anything to have people leave rating and reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:46):
If you're listening and you either checking out the podcast or you're already a listener, please leave a rating and a review and subscribe and follow.

Jessica Livingston (01:08:54):
Thank you. Can I ask you a question about podcasting really quickly?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:58):
Sure, let's do it.

Jessica Livingston (01:08:59):
When you do a podcast, after you hang up with a person, can you tell, do you have a gut instinct like, "Oh, that was a really great "?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:07):
What's interesting is, the ones that I sometimes think, holy moly, that was incredible, don't do as well as I would think. And sometimes ones I think didn't go amazing, actually do a lot better than I think. And I think there's a difference between the energy and the fun of it versus the content and the interesting value of the actual conversation. And so sometimes you feel like that was so fun, so good, I loved it, but people are like, "Nah, I didn't learn anything." So those are interesting. That's something I've learned.

Jessica Livingston (01:09:37):
Okay. Yeah, because people come to yours expecting to learn things. Now I'm a little nervous, I'm going to get axed because I'm not teaching them anything valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:46):
You're so modest. This was incredible. I think we've taught people a lot of really important and really actionable things and I know you don't think you did, but you did. And with that, we've covered a ton of ground. We've talked through every single thing that I was hoping we talked through. Is there anything else you wanted to share or maybe leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Jessica Livingston (01:10:08):
No, I mean, honestly I can't think of... I think I windbagged enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:14):
This was incredible. You talked exactly the right amount of time. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jessica Livingston (01:10:24):
Ready as I'll ever be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:26):
Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Jessica Livingston (01:10:31):
Well, I definitely would recommend my first, second and third books would all be P.G. Wodehouse books. Do you know him as an author?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
No.

Jessica Livingston (01:10:41):
Ask Jeeves. Okay, so he was an old school author and he wrote the Ask Jeeves books about the Butler and Bertie Wooster.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):
Not the search engine.

Jessica Livingston (01:10:54):
They're so funny and fabulously written. His use of words makes me laugh so hard. And so I would specifically recommend the starter books that... He wrote tons of books and he lived till he was like a hundred. Start with Very Good, Jeeves or Right ho, Jeeves, Carry On, Jeeves. Those three are really good books. And then I tend to read, so Paul's the big reader in the family, he reads riveting books on Roman grains and anything that has to do with medieval history. I tend to read biographies of people, especially musicians, especially English musicians, strangely. And so I've recommended, to a lot of people, if you really want a good autobiography, because I sometimes hate autobiographies because I feel like people hold back and don't really share everything. Keith Richards, his autobiography called Life, is really good if you're a fan of the Rolling Stones at all. That was really good.

(01:12:04):
And then I recently read Barbra Streisand's biography called, I think it's called, My Name is Barbra something, and I kept thinking as I was reading this, every female founder should read this book. And you're looking at me like that's so random, but it's because she was such a success within this totally male-dominated world of Hollywood and just treated like garbage and dismissed and called a diva when she was very particular about something. Whereas, a man would be called a great director and she was called a diva, and I felt like every woman should just read this to inspire them. It was such a great book. Long, but very good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:52):
Incredible recommendations. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jessica Livingston (01:12:57):
I don't tend to watch recent movies. I watch old school movies from the 50s through the 90s and stuff. My favorite new TV show, just off the top of my head right now, is Clarkson's Farm. Have you heard of that, on Amazon?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:12):
Nope.

Jessica Livingston (01:13:13):
Jeremy Clarkson, he's in the show called Top Gear. I don't watch that. But he lives out in the English countryside. He has a farm, and he decided that he'd farm it. And the whole show is about him getting into this business that he knows nothing about, everything goes wrong, but it is hysterical and heartbreaking at the same time. I've learned so much about England and about where I live and the crops that are grown, and how hard it is for farmers. He's really shone a light on the difficulty of being a farmer these days and it's fabulous. Clarkson's Farm. And it has some bad language in it, but I do recommend that kids watch it, because it's just a good show to watch as a family if you can deal with a little foul language. The Brits drop a lot of F-bombs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:09):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with people, find useful in work or in life?

Jessica Livingston (01:14:16):
It's so boring, but I always try to treat people the way I'd like to be treated myself, really, is fundamental life lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:26):
It's like boring but so powerful and important. And I try to live that same way. And I think it's a good reminder to people, sometimes the most, I think it was Michael Pollan had said that, "Cliches are cliches because they're so true." They're so true, we're tired of hearing it. Sometimes it's important to be reminded of them. Who's most influenced you in your career? Who do you think of when you're like, this person's really had the most influence on me?

Jessica Livingston (01:14:51):
In my career, I definitely have to say my husband, Paul Graham. I've just learned so much from him over the years, and he's such a good person and I think people who know him, all know that he is. It's just, he has such a big online personality either through Twitter or through his essays. And so he has a lot of people that don't like him, because he also speaks what he believes. And he is not afraid to say anything if he believes it's true and needs to be said. Whereas, I'm the exact opposite. I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going near that. I'm not touching that with a ten-foot pole. I don't even want to get in someone's crosshairs or fight with someone." And I admire that so much. There's so much that he's done with Y Combinator and just in our personal life that is just so admirable and I've really learned a lot from him.

(01:15:53):
It's such a boring thing to learn from your husband, but at the same time, I'm going to extend this, I'm going to windbag a little bit longer. I have learned so much from the founders that we funded. Some of them are just incredible people and have been through so much and survived so much and built these amazing companies that I couldn't have even imagined when we funded them, that these companies would be as successful as they are, and they're all, so many of them, are just great people. And they now teach me things, honestly. Like Brian Chesky teaches me things. The student has become the master. He knows so much more about me and running a business, and I often will go to him for advice. And so I'm really lucky to be surrounded by so many smart people in the startup world, because as a startup nerd, I could talk about startups and think about them all the time, and it's so great to have all these people around sort of lifting me up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):
Would you believe that a cereal experience led to a 92 billion business today? I just looked it up, how big they've gotten.

Jessica Livingston (01:17:09):
Honestly, I wouldn't. I wish I could say, "Oh, I knew they'd be this big." But the truth is, with all of the super successful startups, yeah you can remember feeling very positively about them and certainly feeling like, as they went along in the first few years, like they're doing really well, they're really determined, they're doing a great job, but you just never really think. They themselves, probably didn't realize that they'd ever be that big. Let's face it. That's just the way startups are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:43):
Okay. Here's the actual final question. Is there a fun story of early days YC, whether it's with Airbnb founders or Paul or anything that comes to mind as just like, wow, what a different time that was, or what a surprising thing that happened then?

Jessica Livingston (01:17:58):
It's funny you ask, because actually one of my ideas I've had lately is that I want to start thinking about writing sort of a YC biography kind of book. I don't know when the time is, but the point is, I have to remember things because it's hard. When it's been 20 years to go way back, you have to remember specific things that happened. YC, I just remember the early days being so magical and so pure. When we started, no one knew about us, no one was bothering us. We just did what we were doing with no distractions. We were helping, albeit a very small group of founders, eight in that first summer, we were just doing what we loved doing and growing organically. And no one was scrutinizing us or blaming us for things or writing negative news stories about us. The negative stories in the press, because I'm a people-person and I'm very sensitive, Paul's not as sensitive as me, and so he doesn't care if there's a negative story in the press that's not true.

(01:19:09):
I do. It really affected me, and I hated when we got big enough that people would lie about us and say bad things. So I look back fondly when we first started of it was the most fun time of my life, the most productive time of my life, didn't have kids then, and I could just help the founders and learn about all these exciting things that happened in the startup world, because it was new to me then, the startup world was new when we started Y Combinator, so I had a lot of learning to do. And I met all these cool people, and it was just very authentic, no one was doing it to be cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:48):
Okay. Well, let me ask maybe one other question. Was there a moment when you felt like YC was working? When it felt like, wow, maybe this is going to make it?

Jessica Livingston (01:19:56):
There were sort of two moments that I remember I felt like YC was working, because remember, we started Y Combinator as 100% like an experiment. Could we fund younger founders with small amounts of money? That was it. Then that summer we created this batch investment idea, and then that became the idea of funding them in batches. And that was the first aha moment was after that first summer when we invited people to participate in the Summer Founders Program, which is what it was called. And remember, that first summer had Sam Altman, Emmett Shear, Justin Kan, Alexis and Steve of Reddit, they were in the first batch. And the batch thing worked really well because they all became friends. We could have dinner every week, and bring in guest speakers and then introduce them to investors at demo day, and that whole batch-investing thing was an aha moment and we said, "Oh my gosh, let's keep doing this. This really works." And so that was a moment where we knew we were onto something, and that's when we then did it in California in the winter.

(01:21:11):
But the second big moment was probably, I remember it was like a year later, and no reporter would write about us, investors really didn't think that much of us, but I remember when Reddit got bought by Condé Nast in 2006. It was that, and then at the same time, I think it was like Charles River Ventures or one of these Boston, maybe it wasn't even Boston, but it was a VC firm, did the seed program where they invested maybe a 100K in startups, and the press loved that. They wrote all about this $100,000 investment, and they'd sort of mentioned Y Combinator as doing small investments. And then that, coupled with the Reddit press, sort of made us feel like, oh my gosh, we are sort of legitimate, and the eyes of outsiders became sort of aware of who we were. And I sort of felt like we've arrived, we've been in the press, people are finally paying attention.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:17):
That's amazing. And it's funny that Reddit just went public, it's kind of the other side of that coin.

Jessica Livingston (01:22:21):
I know. Pretty impressive. Definitely didn't necessarily think that was going to be happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):
I know you have to run, but I can't help but ask around what you just talked about where you decided to invest in batches. You wrote this really interesting point that none of us had any experience angel investing, and that's where the idea of funding startups and batches came from. We decided to fund a bunch of startups at once during the summer so that we could learn how to invest. And I love that your inexperience in doing it, created this structure. That unique weakness/strength is what led to the way YC operates, and I think that's really interesting.

Jessica Livingston (01:22:59):
Yeah, we definitely wanted to learn more about how to be investors, so that's when we decided to do this summer founders program where we could invest in a whole bunch at once, and then the plan was to go to asynchronous investing like normal investors, but we realized that there was something magical about this batch thing. So sometimes, I always say we love domain experts, but sometimes maybe ignorance is sort of bliss and you just discover new things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:27):
Jessica, this was everything I hoped it would be. We covered so much ground. I think people are going to love it no matter what you think.

Jessica Livingston (01:23:33):
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Two final questions. Where can folks check out The Social Radars and anything else you want people to know about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jessica Livingston (01:23:41):
Well, you check out The Social Radars on all the podcast platforms; Apple, Spotify, Amazon, all of those. And then there's a website, socialradars.com. And they can be helpful by just listening to it and spreading the word because I don't do any marketing for it besides posting on Twitter, just because it's expensive doing a podcast and stuff. So I don't do any marketing. So if it resonates with you, if you find an episode interesting, please spread the word and write a review and rating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
I was just going to add that, I'm glad you threw that in there. Jessica, thank you so much for being here.

Jessica Livingston (01:24:25):
Thank you so much, Lenny. It was a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:28):
Same for me. Bye, everyone.

Jessica Livingston (01:24:30):
Bye.

# Building minimum lovable products, stories from WeWork & Airbnb, and thriving as a PM | Jiaona Zhang

## Transcript

Jiaona Zhang (00:00:00):
I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. You could be known for shepherding like the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking. Working with go-to--market teams and cross-functional stakeholders that could be like your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems, find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.

Lenny (00:00:43):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is JZ. JZ is senior vice president of product at Webflow. She's also a lecture at Stanford, teaching a course on product management. Before this, she was senior director of product management at WeWork, a longtime product leader at Airbnb, where I got to work with JZ for a number of years and she's also PM at Dropbox and at a gaming company called Pocket Gems.

(00:01:12):
In her conversation, we dig into the most common mistakes early product managers make in their career. Plus JZ's biggest product mistake. We cover the concept of minimal lovable products versus minimal viable products. We talk about JZ's unique frameworks for road mapping and prioritization and OKRs and her take on how to structure your first 90 days as a product leader at a new company, plus what she's learned from her wild year at WeWork. Also, the best advice she's ever gotten around product and leadership and the story of Airbnb Plus and where it went wrong.

(00:01:43):
I've been hoping to get JZ on the podcast for a while and I'm really happy that we finally made this happen. With that, I bring you JZ after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:53):
Today's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you are using the same datasets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high quality data from real humans and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.

(00:02:35):
If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to be become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.

(00:03:10):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one-pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people publish in the Miro verse.

(00:03:45):
When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works. Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. Actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:04:22):
JZ, welcome to the podcast.

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:24):
Thanks for having me. I'm so excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:26):
It's 100% my pleasure. Amongst your many accomplishments, you teach product management at Stanford, which sounds very fancy. How long have you been doing this at this point?

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:37):
I think six years. Yeah.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Okay. So my question, the real question I want to ask about this is, in that time you've seen a lot of new PMs and you've seen these PMs succeed, you've seen some fail. What are the most common mistakes that you find new PMs make in this experience of helping new PMs get into the field?

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:56):
I think something that is really hard to untrain, but I think every human does it, is you jump to solutions. And so one of the biggest things I see, not just in my course but also just as a PM and some of the mistakes that you make as a PM is the idea of you get really attached to a solution, a way of implementing something that you can see in your head that you want to build.

(00:05:16):
And so that's the first thing I really want to unteach in our course. And so a lot of people will literally come in, they'll be like, "I want to build X startup" or "I want to do this thing," or "I'm in blank school and I've been doing a lot of research on this particular area." And so untraining that and being like, "Hey, we're going to go out there. We are not going to think at all about the thing that you want to build, but instead we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, 'Hey, you want to build X thing for Y person.'" So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around.

Lenny (00:05:55):
Does a lot of this come from people want to get into product management because they think "Finally I'll have the power, finally I'll be able to tell people what to build, finally my ideas really going to matter?" Is that where a lot lobby comes from?

Jiaona Zhang (00:06:06):
I think there's a part of that. One of the first things I teach is you're not a CEO, you're, you're not here... You actually have very little true authority because you don't actually manage anyone. A lot of it is all through influence, and so that is also a piece where you have to kind of untrain that thinking. I do think a lot of people come into the product role thinking that I get to call the shots, I get to make the decisions, I get to decide what gets built. And really your job is not that. Your job is to understand here are the opportunities, and then you're kind of pulling together all the different possibilities and you're really editing. So I do think it comes from desire for a lot of people thinking that's what the product role is when it actually isn't.

Lenny (00:06:44):
So let's go to the other side of this question. We talked about what mistakes new PMs make. I'm curious, what's the biggest product mistake that you've made?

Jiaona Zhang (00:06:53):
Wow, that's a good one. It's so interesting. I feel like as product people, we're always making mistakes and we're always learning. Maybe I'll give an example from Airbnb since you and I were both there. And this one does stand out to me, we were working on this concept called Airbnb Plus. If you took a step back, what we were really trying to do is to be like, "Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of... It's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?" But I do think we were very solution-first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Sonders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like "[inaudible 00:07:36] what are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?"

(00:07:38):
And so we went really hard down the solution space. We essentially were like, "Let's go inspect our inventory, let's actually try to manage our inventory more." And really what we should have done is taken a step back and be like, "What's the real problem? The real problem is people want to know what they're getting themselves into. We need to represent the homes a lot better." And I think the other piece here that's really important is, what, as a company is your strategic strength and what's in your wheelhouse? So for example, Airbnb, we weren't that strong in operations. Again, we're this platform with this marketplace. And so if you don't have that muscle and then you're asking the company, the teams to essentially build it from the ground up, that's really, really difficult. Not to mention the unit economics, are the unit economics actually going to work even as you scale?

Lenny (00:08:22):
Yeah, I feel like Airbnb Plus is an untold story that somebody should tell and that could be its own podcast, I guess.

Jiaona Zhang (00:08:28):
You and I can tell it.

Lenny (00:08:30):
We could tell this could be Airbnb Plus The Hidden Story. As you said, the problem it was trying to solve was people don't really trust... They don't want to even consider Airbnb because it's like, "No, I don't want to stay in someone's home. I don't know what it'll be. It's unpredictable." And so as an outsider, it felt like a really clever approach. "We're going to vet them, we're going to make sure they're awesome. There's a minimum bar." And I guess this is the question is do you think it was just like "This is never possible because we'll never make money as a business doing this because we don't make that much per booking and investing time, resources, sending people pillows, all that stuff is ever going to be economical"? Or do you think there was a path that was just not executed well?

Jiaona Zhang (00:09:10):
I think there wasn't really a clear path. I think there was less of-

Lenny (00:09:10):
Yeah, that's my impression.

Jiaona Zhang (00:09:15):
Exactly. And it was more just like if you understood... Again, this is what my point around unit economics, there are things where I think you have magical thinking around unit economics. You're like, "When we get to the scale of X, it's all going to work out. We can make these things happen." I think you actually need to really make sure that unit economics work quite at the beginning. That is definitely one lesson. And I think the other thing is, and going back to spirit of what are you trying to achieve. If you're trying to achieve this idea of really knowing the quality of the place, and for a platform like Airbnb, the right way to go about doing is through our reviews, through our guest reviews, which are essentially free as opposed to literally sending out inspectors.

(00:09:51):
And I think that the other things are if you can get signal on what are the things around quality that people care about, is it cleaning? Is it, "Hey, I'm locked out"? And I think that there are other solutions besides inspection that then get at that. So for example, it is actually cheaper to go send everyone a lockbox than to deploy an inspector and go look at your property. It is actually cheaper to maybe do a partnership with a bunch of cleaners in different local areas and then get that as part of the fee, as opposed to doing the inspection. So again, it's really about what are you really trying to achieve? What is the user problem in each of these areas and can you target that problem with the particular listing that you're looking at?

(00:10:33):
And so I personally don't believe the unit economics ever would've really worked out. I think we should have known that or we should have dug into that more at the very beginning and then to get very tailored instead of one blunt instrument to solve it all, "Hey, we're going to go inspect." It's like what is the problem for this listing and what's the best solution to fix that problem?

Lenny (00:10:51):
There's a couple things that I think are important product leadership lessons here. One is Airbnb and Brian and many great leaders are famous for imagining the ideal situation, imagining the great end result and then working backwards. And often that leads to great results when you're being really ambitious and "I don't know how we're going to get there, we're just going to shoot big and hopefully we figure it out." Sometimes it works out. In this case it didn't work out. And what you're finding, maybe you even knew this early on, is just like there's no possible world where this could have worked in this approach. Is there anything you've learned about just when to think big and not even like "Forget it. We're going to figure it out. I know this seems impossible, but we're just going to try it anyway"? Do you have any kind of framework of when to think big, then just go for it? Versus, "Oh, let's just work out the math today," is this ever possible?

Jiaona Zhang (00:11:42):
I think it's really important for every company to be dreaming big. If you don't have a big vision, it's really hard for you to innovate, but you got to couple that really big vision with thoughtfulness around your execution. And so I think that one of the biggest tips I have is how do to be clear about the phase that you're in? So I think it's totally fine to be like, "Hey, we are going to try X for six months, three months, whatever it is, and we're explicitly going to go learn these types of things. We're going to learn why are people? Are there signals that we would that would indicate that again, the communication with host isn't great or this type of listing, if it's hosted by a person with multiple property?" I think there are factors we can be like, "Hey, we can learn this very explicit thing in a given period of time."

(00:12:32):
And you can do what I call unscalable things in that prototyping phase, in that early phase to go learn those lessons. But you just have to be very, very clear with your team on what phase you're in. "Hey, we're in the learning phase and we explicitly are trying to learn these things" versus, "Hey, we have this really big vision and we're just going to go at it." That is not recommended in my mind. It's breaking it down into these smaller chunks. That I think gets you the balance of thinking really, really big, but also being able to be like, "Okay, we are still going to be able to say, 'Okay, this path is not going to work out. We ran at it for a short period of time. We got these learnings, now let's go down this other path.'"

Lenny (00:13:11):
Yeah, there's also some cost fallacy that kicks in of just like, "Oh, I spend so much time and money and resources on this thing. Let's just go a little bit longer. Let's just see if we give it another quarter, maybe it'll work out."

Jiaona Zhang (00:13:21):
You should articulate what success looks like and the milestones you want to hit in the small intervals that I talked about. So you don't get into this world where you're like, "Hey, I've gone for two years investing in this thing. Now we got to cut it." It's like, what is the quarter long milestone? Okay, what's the next quarter long milestone? And every single point, what is a go and no-go? And I think that really can help a team and a company say "It's okay. I invested a quarter in it, but I didn't invest two years."

Lenny (00:13:46):
The other important lesson here is about the importance of as a product leader pushing back and convincing leadership that you are wrong and this shouldn't happen. I remember talking to one of our colleagues, Mike Lewis, who was leading a different team with Airbnb, and he was just like, "Oh, I realized I'm the person that should be saying, 'No, we shouldn't do this now'" because he was the head of product for one of the new [inaudible 00:14:09]. And I know maybe in that situation it was impossible because Brian was very into this and everyone was like, "We need to do this thing."

(00:14:18):
I guess is there anything you've learned about how to push back on these sorts of things that the founder's really into when it makes sense to go along? Like "Cool, let's do it. Let's buy in." As a leader, you have to be excited and he needs to feel like, "Oh, JZ is really excited about this too. We got to try it." Even though maybe you feel like it's not going to work out. So I guess the question is when do you think it makes sense to try convince the founder, "No, this is the bad idea" versus like "Let's go for it"?

Jiaona Zhang (00:14:42):
I think first it comes down to your conviction. Do you actually have conviction that this is a bad idea or are you personally still learning? Right. I think if you're at the point, if you're like, "I have total conviction," then your job is to say, no, you really... If you do not, you're not doing your job. And then the question is what are the tips in how to convince someone who's very bought into an idea that that's not the right idea? And there what I would say is it's understanding the spirit of what they're trying to achieve. Being able to go back with, "Hey, I understand the spirit. The spirit is that we're trying to get people who previously didn't consider Airbnb before to come and use Airbnb, but the right way to do it is not this very time-intensive, cost-intensive way to inspect all these homes. The way to do it is to be much more granular in what we ask people when they upload their home and more checks in that. And that could be automated and through technology as opposed to through humans."

(00:15:37):
It's coming back with actual options. It's like saying... And I think we did that a little bit to be honest, when we as a team evolve, we learn and we're like, "This isn't going to work." And I explicitly moved off the team and I was like, "I'm going to work on the review system. I'm going to continue to evolve this and make it better because that is the actual scalable way to do this as opposed to keep going at it in the very manual process."

(00:15:59):
And so I think that the biggest tip I would have for people in this situation is really understand whether it's the founder or your manager or whoever it is, what is it that they're trying to accomplish for the user and for the business? Remind them of that, get aligned on that. And then come back with better options. A lot of these people, they're very smart and they're very motivated. They ultimately want to just do the right thing for their users. When you come back with a much better solution and you have the data and you have the thinking behind it's very rare that someone will be like, "I still want to go after this solution despite the fact that it's not working and you proposed a much better path forward."

Lenny (00:16:37):
And I think to touch on what you've already said is also make sure it's actually... There's a world where this could work. Do some math to figure out if this is a business that will actually make some money in the future.

Jiaona Zhang (00:16:49):
Totally.

Lenny (00:16:50):
Okay. I'm going to bounce around a little bit. I have a bunch of different questions around different topics. You popularized this concept of minimal lovable product versus this idea that everyone always comes back to, which is minimal viable product. Can you just talk about what is a minimal lovable product and then when does it make sense to go in that direction versus a traditional MVP?

Jiaona Zhang (00:17:10):
The reason I care so much about minimal lovable product is because I do think in a world where there are so many different options, it's hard to just feel like, "Hey, use this thing. It barely meets a quality bar." And so I think this idea of actually deeply understanding for the thing that you're working on, what is a lovable experience? What is the quality bar that resonates with your users? And again, especially in a world where there might be a lot of different options. Minimal lovable products is the new MVP. The new minimal viable product.

(00:17:40):
So I think that's the real point, but at the end of the day, it does come back to what are the options that a user has and what are they trying to do? So there's a world where your quality bar, your "Quality bar," or let's call it your polished bar, can be a little bit lower because the reality is the thing that you're "Competing against" or you're replacing is literally a manual workflow. It's like spreadsheets. It's doing something in a super terrible way.

(00:18:05):
So you want to get your product to market as quickly as possible, so it doesn't make sense for you to be like, "I'm going to build these 15 additional features." Because compared to what people are doing right now, your product without those 15 additional features is perfectly fine, perfectly usable, and perfectly quite honestly lovable. So it requires a lot of understanding of, again, your users and the space that you play in and the tolerance of your given user. So for example, a designer might have a lot higher of a bar of like "This is the kind of workflow I want, this is the kind of bar for my product." But again, someone sitting on the finance team or the IT team, their bar might be like, "Oh, I'm used to doing these 15 things and so your thing is just a lot better."

Lenny (00:18:53):
I'd love to go even one level deeper. Is there an example of something you've worked on that was minimal lovable product that you think about? Or is there something out there that's an example of here's maybe an example of a minimal lovable product versus MVP?

Jiaona Zhang (00:19:08):
Again, it's very hard. I think every product team, every product person struggles with this idea of what is the minimal viable. Even that concept itself is difficult and not to mention minimal lovable. I'll give a Webflow example. Very recently, so have been investing in a couple of new features, memberships and logic, new functionality for our users. And what we realized at the end of the day after investing in these areas, we were like, "Hey, we can get to minimal viable, but we don't know if we can actually get to minimal lovable in a way that our users really, really want. And so does it make sense for us to continue to go down this path of continues to chip away to get to minimal lovable when we are maybe hitting diminishing returns for our user base? Or does it actually make sense to release what we have but then encourage our ecosystem to contribute the lovable piece?"

(00:19:56):
And again, it's not just like you put it out there and you hope, you have to have a very strong point of view of are we at minimal viable, are we at minimal lovable? Where in between are we? And so having that point of view and then being able to say, "Are we going to be able to meet it as a company? Are we going to rely on our ecosystem to help us meet it? What are we actually going to do?" And then even within the feature set, it's very much a how do we do some things well as opposed to do a little bit of everything? I think that is a big piece of minimal lovable, which is again... To me it's better to do five things instead of the 15 things in a really, really great way with a high degree of polish with a, "Oh, this really meets my need," versus trying to do everything and just doing a little bit of everything. And so every part of the experience feels a little bit clunky. It's not quite there.

(00:20:45):
People I think would actually respect this idea of "You've given me minimal lovable in five areas as opposed to minimal viable in 15 areas."

Lenny (00:20:53):
Is there anything you've seen of just that makes something lovable? I don't know. I know it's not easy to define, but what are things you've seen that makes something lovable? Is it delightful features? Or is it what you're saying, which is just things are actually good, there's fewer things, but they're each really good?

Jiaona Zhang (00:21:08):
There's definitely this idea of the thing is just good. It has all. High quality, it's not janky, it doesn't feel weird. I'll give you a very small example again, just from Webflow, this idea of keyboard shortcuts, feels small, but that is a piece that creates a lot of love from user base who are power users. And then there's this concept of pixie dusts, and maybe I'll pull out of call it like design tool space and we'll talk about some of the other things, whether it's Dropbox or Airbnb, but you can just do a little bit of that extra pixie dusts. So an example from Airbnb when we're doing the mobile app revamp where like "There's like these basic table stakes, but if we actually added in templates and we made it so that these templates could be maybe pre-populated in certain ways from the content they already have," that is lovable, that is that extra little bit of pixie dust and spending the time to do that.

(00:21:55):
Again, you can't pixie dust everything. At the end of the day, you basically have your time, your staffing and the scope of your project and something has to give. And so at the end of the day, you can't just keep investing, keep investing because it's going to push out your launch timeline, but can you pick a few different areas where you're like, "I'm going to scatter that pixie dust, I'm going to do a little bit more than what users are expecting"? And that creates that lovability.

Lenny (00:22:20):
Shifting to a different topic, I know you have strong opinions about road mapping and OKRs, improvisation, and I know that's a big topic, but let me just ask, what's the most common advice you give around how to roadmap well, do OKRs, prioritize and/or just, I don't know, common mantras or things you always come back to be successful in these areas?

Jiaona Zhang (00:22:40):
Road mapping prioritization are one bucket for me. And then OKRs is another. So I'll maybe give you my biggest tip in each one of these buckets.

(00:22:46):
So for road mapping, my biggest thing that I tell my teams is "You're telling a story. So what I want from you is I want themes, I want a story. Why are these things the biggest things to invest in these levers, the biggest ones to pull?" And what I really don't want, what I think is a very common mistake from road mapping is people thinking a spreadsheet with a bunch of projects, the RICE framework, everything has an impact, a cost and an effort column filled out. They think that is prioritization and that is a roadmap. If you just do that right and then you present that to your team, they're off to the races.

(00:23:26):
But what people, what humans really crave is like, "Why am I doing this body of work?" And I think it's also really, really important to have that really crisply articulated in your own head because ultimately what happens is you'll learn things as a product person. You'll be like, "Oh, I assumed this in the narrative in my head about my users or about my product area, and then I learned why and therefore my thinking changed." So instead of it being this massive spreadsheet where you're going in, you're tweaking all the values, what is the story that you're telling about your roadmap that these inputs can then go and influence?

(00:23:59):
It could be like, "Hey, I just realized I didn't know before that we have a lot more power users on our," or "Maybe we have a lot more non-technical users." That input changes my roadmap and changes my themes in a pretty dramatic way. So skating at that level is really, really critical, I think for a roadmap as opposed to going down to the really granular details of the how. So that's the biggest thing on road mapping, which is like tell a story. What are your themes? Make it so that your team can come up with the actual how and the projects and all the little details, but really create that scaffolding for them to know what's important.

Lenny (00:24:33):
Can I ask a follow-up question on that?

Jiaona Zhang (00:24:35):
Totally, yeah.

Lenny (00:24:36):
It's easy to visualize the roadmap of a spreadsheet to help people visualize what you're suggesting there. What does that actual artifact look like? Is it a doc with maybe an ancillary spreadsheet of the actual prioritization? Is it a deck? How do you actually deliver this to you with like "JZ, here's our proposal for our team"?

Jiaona Zhang (00:24:55):
Yeah, I'm a big fan of docs and decks are obviously helpful if you're talking live, but I do think in a remote-first culture or lots of us are in hybrid remote cultures it's hard because decks typically require a voiceover. And so we have been doing a big push even on my teams where I'm like, "Write it down and document. Force yourself to write the pros because when you write the pros, you can actually add that level of granularity." So very much so the same way like "I'm a roadmap is a story. You're telling themes, you write a story in a notebook, you write a story on pages," and so a doc is definitely preferred. And even in the doc just being like, "Here's what we're trying to achieve, here are the big areas I want to invest in, here are my big themes." And then going into each of those themes and being like, "These are the big projects."

(00:25:40):
And then linking out, again, not even to a spreadsheet, but linking out to the artifacts and the systems that your team actually uses. So if your team uses Jira, go ahead and link out to Jira because so often docs get out of... Or spreadsheets get out of date, because they're like a snapshot of whatever it is that you needed at that point in time. But instead you link out to the actual things that your teams are working out of, you can always be like, "These are the themes. I will edit these if I learn major things that would change my themes. And then let's go link out to the Jira where you can just see the snapshot of the roadmap at any given point in time."

Lenny (00:26:12):
Do you have a template or common structure you suggest to teams for laying out this story or is it just depends on the quarter, it depends on the year?

Jiaona Zhang (00:26:21):
I'll give a plug for a new thing coming out of Reforge, which is this concept of artifacts. And so we do have a lot of artifacts out there, so what's our general product development process? What are our templates for our specs? What are our templates for some of these things that we're talking about, a roadmap, like a broader roadmap instead of just a feature spec. So yes, we have a ton of those artifacts, are always evolving. I think every team takes it and tweaks it a little bit, but I'm a big believer of bringing those artifacts back and then sharing them across the team. And so product operations is also a function that we've invested in because it just really greases the wheels, gets all of our teams speaking the same language.

Lenny (00:26:57):
Awesome.

(00:28:02):
Moving to a different topic, what is your number one piece of advice to new PMs who want to accelerate their career? What do you find most often is the blocker or thing holding them back or something they can change that'll accelerate things?

Jiaona Zhang (00:28:18):
There's so many parts to it, but I'll pick one. And there are many frameworks even beyond the one, but let's pick one for your question, which is I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. And what I mean by that is when you're known in your company for a particular thing.... I'll give you a couple examples. You could be known for shepherding the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking, working with go-to market teams and cross-functional stakeholders, that could be your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems. You could be known for working on things that are really regulatory complex. Find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get. Because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.

Lenny (00:29:16):
Is there something you were known to be excellent at in the course of your career?

Jiaona Zhang (00:29:20):
I would say early on in my career, it was actually the fact that I had a strong analytics background. And so when I joined gaming, I came from consulting, I didn't have any CS background or design background, and so it was really creating a reputation around being very analytical, around being able to analyze the datasets of my game and then make decisions. I also learned as I was doing that I was actually really good at execution, and so being able to keep a lot of plates spinning and working on the largest studio and managing all the complex pieces of that, that was what I discovered. I didn't know this, but I discovered as I started working in the role.

(00:29:58):
And so that was something I brought to Dropbox. When I joined Dropbox. It was like I knew that I could work with a lot of different teams and make sure that we hit a launch deadline, and so I would find myself trying to lean into that superpower and then when delivering upon that, getting more responsibility, "Hey, you just launched this really complex thing, this was a project that had to work across a lot of different platforms. We're using Griddle APIs." And it was a very, very small team and it had a very, very tight deadline.

(00:30:29):
So when you're like, "I can do something like this," you end up getting more responsibility because people were like, "Oh, she was able to do something that was really hard with a small team," and so that's how you get more responsibility. But it has evolved in my career. I think that at the beginning of your career, you do want to lean into some of these pieces. It makes sense, but also even when you start to manage, it shifts dramatically. Being known as the best executor is not necessarily the thing that gives you and your team the most responsibility. So as I've grown my career, whether it's at Airbnb or WeWork or other places I flex into maybe a different... It's like taking your core strength but then flexing it and finding different ways to bring it to life.

Lenny (00:31:09):
Much of what I just heard is you just worked incredibly hard and just got shit done. And I think that's very, very important and often leads to a lot of success.

Jiaona Zhang (00:31:20):
PMs have to get shit done. Yeah, ultimately you're responsible for the outcome just no matter what happens.

Lenny (00:31:26):
Yeah. I like that. Be known for getting shit done and working really hard, and that's never going to serve you badly. I think that is just lasting advice for being successful as a PM. I realized that we were talking about your tips on prioritization, road mapping and then OKRs, and then I shifted topics and you never got to the OKR bucket. So let me come back to that.

Jiaona Zhang (00:31:47):
Yes. My biggest tip on OKRs is actually get really, really crisp on qualitatively. What would make you say "Yes, we did a great job"? And the reason I pushed so hard on that is because I see so many teams get really mucked down by OKRs. They're like, "Oh man, if I don't hit my OKR, I feel like I'm going to have a really bad reputation, or maybe I won't get promoted." You just get all this fear around OKRs. And so you see people, you see people sandbagging, you see people being hesitant to put in numbers until the very last second until they're super, super confident. And that results in ultimately a failure for your company to innovate and move quickly.

(00:32:29):
And so what I really push on for OKRs is are you actually... What's the spirit... I think I asked this question maybe too much to my team, but what is the spirit of what you're trying to achieve and what would make you say, 'I really, really crushed it this past quarter'? And so it's less about I would rather have all the OKRs be red or yellow and we missed everything and we learned around why we missed it than everything to be green. In fact, when everything's green, you're like, "We definitely did not set ambitious enough OKRs." And so it really pushed a lot on what does it truly mean to crush it and be successful? What does it mean for our users? What does it mean for our business? What does that... For our users to feel X, can you describe that? Can you write that out? For our business to see this in terms of the revenue growth?

(00:33:17):
And I think it's really hard because a lot of times, you get your data scientists, you get the PM themselves being like, "Oh man, I'm owning an input metric, not an output metric. And so I definitely can't sign up for that revenue target because I have an input metric." And all of those things are true, but if you don't do the homework of really drawing that line of being like, "This is the ultimate thing I want to do for the company and for my users," then a lot of times you end up hitting all your OKRs, but the company and your users at large are like, "I don't feel anything different." Your company doesn't look at the things that you've worked on and they don't say like "This is a smashing success." Your users are feeling no differently. And so that is the worst outcome in my head where your OKRs, you're almost like doing OKRs for the sake of OKRs, as opposed to letting them be a guide to delivering really great product to your end customer.

Lenny (00:34:09):
I like the idea of that, but imagine what often happens is you sign up for an ambitious OKR, you don't wait till the last second to commit to it and then ends up being red, and then you go into performance reviews and like, "Oh, Lenny didn't hit his OKRs. Look at this guy. His team is not doing great." How do you think about that as a product leader understanding if the team actually did well and the PM is performing well when they sign up for these really ambitious OKRs and their story's great and they're doing the right thing, but they fail?

Jiaona Zhang (00:34:37):
First of all, I think it's creating a culture where you are not punished for that. Because I definitely don't want a culture where it's like you took a risk and you failed and therefore your performance is impacted. I'd much rather people take risks than to be safe. So I think that's the first thing. That being said, you're also not doing a good job as a PM if you're like, "This is my super, super ambitious thing," and you're like, "I have no idea how to achieve it." Your job is to dream big and also have a plan to go tackle it. And so what I would expect the PM to be able to say is, "This is my North Star. I'm not going to be able to do that in a quarter, that just is unreasonable, but here are the five milestones," whatever number, some number of milestones "That it's going to take me to do quarter over quarter to achieve this really, really ambitious thing. And let me draw you that path. Here's the milestone all the way across, and this is the first one. This is why it's so meaningful."

(00:35:24):
So I expect that combination where you're like, "I know where I'm going. It's really, really ambitious." And then you can then break it down. But again, I would much rather have someone shoot for the moon, even for someone to say like "This is the thing I really want to do. I don't know my path yet" than to be really, really safe. Because when you're safe, you're always going to be building something suboptimal. It's going to be suboptimal use of your resources as opposed to actually trying to figure out what the best swing that you can take is.

Lenny (00:35:50):
So it sounds like it comes back to the story of the roadmap and what they're trying to accomplish, and just as long as it feels like the story made sense, there's a path there. The team did their best, I think we know it was really ambitious. We kind of knew maybe they wouldn't get there. It sounds like that's kind of the thing you look for in a performance of the PM.

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:07):
Totally. Yeah.

Lenny (00:36:10):
Awesome. I mentioned WeWork and I want to spend a little time on WeWork. You were at WeWork for about a year, and I think it was in the middle of a lot of the craziness that went on at WeWork.

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:18):
It was. It was 2019, I feel like that year it was either headlines were either about Trump or about WeWork in the news.

Lenny (00:36:26):
That's tough. So what was that like being a PM leader at a company in that craziness? And is there a takeaway from that experience that helps you be a better product manager, a leader, person?

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:37):
Yeah, I learned a lot from my time there. I think the most important lesson I learned was really around... I think there's like a people leader management lesson, and then there's also just like a how do you build an org period. The people lesson I learned was just really around empathy. In fact, essentially what I was doing was I built a team. I spent the first six months of my time there actually growing my team a lot, and not just in the US but in Asia and in Europe. And then the second half of my time there was actually being like, "What do we do? If this is what's happening with WeWork, what are we actually going to do with all of these people who have come to WeWork to work?"

(00:37:19):
And there was so many lessons there around leadership, around how do you think about people? How do you think about giving them the right transition plans? It was a lot of learning. And I think probably a lot of people, even right now through the macroeconomic downturn, they're learning that lesson in a really hard way. And so it was definitely something that I got a crash course on, I think early.

(00:37:44):
And the second lesson really was around not over-hiring. And so I think that was huge, and I think I personally learned that lesson through my time there. And it's something that I'm very conscious of at any company that I go to. Just because laying off half your team is a terrible feeling. Literally having hired people and then having to let them go, it's not something you want to do. And so being really thoughtful around how do we not over-hire? How are we really clear about, again, these milestones of we got to get through these gates, we got to be able to show these types of results, and then we unlock hiring in X, Y, Z ways? That hygiene is really, really important.

Lenny (00:38:22):
Feels like this connects back to the Airbnb Plus story of "Let's just be really ambitious. We don't have any idea how we're going to get there, but we're just going to go for it, hire like crazy, scale, put a lot of investment in this thing and hopefully we'll figure it out."

Jiaona Zhang (00:38:34):
I do think there was a little bit of that in the ethos of how WeWork was functioning, for sure. I think that what was really important for us to do was to be like, "We have this." Operationally, WeWork is really strong. In fact, I went to WeWork because having been at Airbnb, I was like, "I don't feel like we've dialed this operational muscle down," but I know from what I've seen and the way WeWork has expanded, that they're really, really excellent at the operations. But I think it was, again, we hired beyond our skis on the tech side. It's like we don't need a team of this size to go do the things that are needed for the product to feel really great. At the end of the day, it's about booking. And yes, there's technology that would accelerate that, but do we need it to be super platform aware? Do we need it to be super futuristic? That's actually not what people care about.

(00:39:19):
So this all goes back to what are people's core desires in whatever product that they're using, whatever thing that your business is trying to serve them? And so really understanding that will help you have a sense of, "Hey, you can still be really ambitious." Again, in a hybrid world, it's like why have real dedicated office space? Every company could go through WeWork as opposed to this dedicated space. That's still a really good idea, that's still a really big vision and a relevant vision, but what's the key piece of that vision? The key piece of that vision is around inventory, and then you make that inventory management easier. You make all of these things easier, but that's not a technology play in the same way as it is an operational play. So just really understanding, again, you can still dream really big, but you don't have to dream big and hire big in all the things in order to have a very ambitious vision that you deliver to the market.

Lenny (00:40:13):
If you think back to WeWork, what was your favorite memory and what was your hardest, least happy memory if anything comes to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (00:40:23):
I think this idea dream really big. I think everyone who had joined WeWork, they were like, "We could do a lot here." The idea of really the physical space infusing technology. I just feel like the people at WeWork were dreamers in the best possible way. So that definitely... I feel like for every company that I've been at, it's really about, you join... I personally joined for the product, but I stayed for the people you joined because you're like, "I want to work on this mission. This product is really motivating." And then you really stay for the people. And the people at We WeWork were really great. So that was definitely my favorite memory.

(00:40:58):
I think the hardest memory was, this gets a little bit personal, but I was actually in my first trimester when we were going through all of these layoffs and I basically was faced with a choice. It was like, "Hey, do I stay at WeWork? I would be guaranteed maternity leave." I was going to be moved onto this other team that was definitely going to stay. "Do I do that or do I actually..." And I think there just a last piece of... The thing I was wrestling with is I hired a lot of these people and I felt really responsible for the fact that I convinced them to come to this company that now was going through a lot of change.

(00:41:33):
And I specifically remember someone when I hired them, we had a long conversation about their visa and in my head I was like, "I just don't feel right. Again, laying someone off. That's only going to have so many days to be able to go find their new role." And so the hardest moment, I actually remember this very vividly, "Am I going to take this new role or am I going to put myself on a layoff list essentially and give the role to someone else on the team?" When I really think about it, yes, I was pregnant, but I would have more time and more freedom to go find my next thing versus someone who I brought to the company who was on a visa.

(00:42:09):
That to me just really stood out and goes back to this concept around leadership is so much about empathy and people as much as it's about understanding your market, your customers, and the strategy of your product.

Lenny (00:42:24):
Damn. What convinced you eventually to take off and try something different?

Jiaona Zhang (00:42:31):
I made the call of, in that particular case, I'd give the role to someone else. And then once I made that call, I was like, "I got to go find something. I know that this is my last day, so I have to go find something." And it was really interesting because I actually... I went through an interview process. I was in my second trimester and then ultimately I chose to join Webflow and I joined when I was literally at the beginning of my third trimester. So I had exactly 90 days before my first son was born.

Lenny (00:43:01):
That's a great segue to the question I was going to ask is around your 90-day plan that I know you put a lot of thought into how to think about the first 90 days, but before we get there, the movie on WeWork with Jared Leto, how similar to reality was that brought?

Jiaona Zhang (00:43:16):
I actually have not watched it. Parent life, you don't have any time. And I do think there's... I feel like if you ask people at Uber, if they've watched some of the [inaudible 00:43:26] they're like, "It's not for me." Same way why I haven't watched Silicon Valley. You're like, "It's a little too close to home."

Lenny (00:43:35):
It was quite a great movie and I really enjoyed it. I'm curious how close it was to real life. Okay, so then back to the 90-day questions. So I know you spent a lot of time thinking about your first 90 days at Webflow, you're pregnant as you described, and you have a perspective on just how to think about the first 90 days when you join a company. Can you just share what you've learned there, what you recommend there?

Jiaona Zhang (00:43:55):
Yeah, I do think the first 90 days, depending on your role is very different. But maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the first 90 days as a head of product. Because you're like, "Whoa." Or even just as a leader, how do you go in, how do you really absorb all the information and get all the context you need and then affect change? And I think what was unique about my first 90 days is it was time bound. It was literally something where you're like, "Sure, I'd love to absorb information for many months, but I just don't have the luxury of the time" and so-

Lenny (00:44:21):
Because you're going to go on mat leave right after?

Jiaona Zhang (00:44:23):
Because yeah, essentially I was going to go on mat leave.

Lenny (00:44:25):
Got it.

Jiaona Zhang (00:44:25):
That's right. And so the biggest things that I thought a lot about for my first 90 days was at the end of the day, yes, you have to really... The most important thing for anyone's for assigning days is to build context and to build context well. But what I had to think about a lot was, "How do I quickly build context probably faster than I would be given the luxury any other time in my life?" And so I thought a lot about who do I speak to at the company? How do I create even just a calendar of speaking to people? Yes, my leadership team, but also across a bunch of functions and then across a bunch of levels. So it was really important for me to even start talking to some of the engineers from the team, some of the engineers who had been there for the longest time to really understand, what's hard about our tech stack? What's going on? What's hard about your day to day?

(00:45:15):
And so I actually took time to really think about, "I want to speak to all of these types of people at the company." And I packed my first couple weeks with a lot of those meetings. And so I think that was one piece, which is like how do you build context as quickly as possible? And my tip there is again, it's not just with your peers, it's not even just with your team, but to really think across all the different functions and then think about where you're going to get the most amount of information in that particular function. I think that was one piece of it.

(00:45:43):
The other piece was I was like, "I'm going to be out." I was only out for two months, but I was like, "That's still a long period of time in the life of a startup." And so what it was really important to me was like, I did not go out having just listened and like "Great, I have the context, I'll see you in two months." But it was really important for me to actually have a plan in place before I went out for my team.

(00:46:03):
And so there were pieces where I was like, "I want to first, again, get that lay of the land. I want to have enough of a strategic, 'Hey, these things make sense. Keep going, keep executing.' 'These things don't make sense, let's identify what those things are and let's actually start to do research around these things so that when I do come back, we have a body of work that we can look at and be like, "Okay, this information, this data is making us choose to go down the path." Or "This is a go or no-go decision. We can make that decision now where we couldn't make that decision before."'"

(00:46:34):
So that was another big piece, which is getting all the strategic pieces in place, having a plan laid out and explicitly articulating in that plan, "Keep moving. These are things that we got to do a lot more research on." And then assigning people like, "Hey, you're going to do this research and then we're going to come back and talk about it in the two months that I was out." And I also took the time, I actually... Funny story, I think I literally had a board meeting the day before I went in for a checkup, and then in the checkup they're like, "You're in labor." And it was really important for me to do that because I was like, "For the things that I'm seeing, for the gaps that I'm seeing. I want everyone to be aware. I don't want to just be with one founder. I want the whole leadership team. I want all the founders, I want the board. I want everyone to be aware that."

(00:47:14):
For example, engineering hiring was really, really important. And I was communicating, "Hey, we are just not staffed in a way where we can deliver some of the ambitious things that we want to do." And so explicitly calling those things out and creating awareness around them and then asking other executives to step in and be accountable, those were big pieces of what I wanted to achieve in my first 90 days.

Lenny (00:47:34):
So I take notes on this. So the first is just get context, figure out who you need to talk to. Is there a tip there of just how many people? Because you could do this infinitely, meet everyone eventually. How many people did you end up maybe scheduling meetings with?

Jiaona Zhang (00:47:47):
Definitely everyone on my direct team and definitely everyone on the leadership team, so call it those two combined were maybe, I don't know, like 20 or so people, 25 people. But then it was really about finding the people in the other functions. And to me, for any given function, it was really getting a read from, again, that leader, but also someone closer to the actual work. And so you look at the functions, whether it's product marketing or engineering, whatever it was. Back then I didn't have designs, like design. And really getting a couple of data points for each one of those functions. So if you add that up, that probably was like 40 to 50 conversations. But again, if you're doing them back to back and you're really synthesizing, you're actually getting a really good picture of what's going on.

Lenny (00:48:35):
And then the second bucket was identify things that need to be shifted, changed, flagged. I imagine there's also an element of trust and building trust. Was that a part of this, of how you thought about it? Or do you feel like as a product leader coming in that's less essential versus say an new PM joining it? A team as an IC?

Jiaona Zhang (00:48:53):
Trust is so important. Trust is everything. As a PM, the trust that your cross-functional partners have in you, the trust that the CEO has is you... It's huge. Trust is everything. And maybe here, I'll even talk about some of the mistakes I made in the first 90 days. I think I was so much like, "I only have 90 days. I got to go, go, go. We got to go." I was almost pushing too hard. I was pushing too hard for change. I think that's the tricky part that every product leader, especially if they're coming into a new role, has to figure out how do I gain trust and then take that trust and then push for change as opposed to push for change too quickly before I have that trust?

(00:49:33):
So again, it was a personal learning and I think part of it was really driven by the time-bound nature of it, but hopefully not everyone has only 90 days. So if you take that learning into mind, it's really thinking about your trust as a bank. It's like you're putting money into your bank and then at some point you're going to take money out, you're going to use that social capital, you're going to use that trust to go push for things, push for change, but you have to be thoughtful about how full your piggy bank is and you don't want to be spending when you don't have the trust in the bank.

Lenny (00:50:06):
What were signs maybe looking back that you didn't necessarily have the trust that you thought you did or you should have had?

Jiaona Zhang (00:50:13):
I think something, a product like Webflow is a very complex product and there are so many pieces to it. It's very difficult to learn the product in the first 90 days, especially if I was also prioritizing all these conversations with the team. And so I think that again, without the time constraint, what I would recommend is to be like, "Hey, every product leader has to take the time to really go deep on the product." Given the complexity of Webflow and given the time-bound nature of when I had to go out, and given the fact I really also wanted to build that social context around what is working and not working from a function working together? Not just what the product is. What I wasn't able to do was spend enough time with the product to be able to have all of that in my back pocket to be able to be like, "Oh, I know how this, this and this works because I've literally used it a bunch."

(00:51:06):
So you had to choose. And in my head I was like, "I would much rather understand how the team is functioning together." And the reality is the team was comprised of a lot of people with a lot of deep product context. So ultimately as all things in product, you know this Lenny, everything's a trade off. And so it's a trade off. And so you had to make the call of what you wanted to trade off. And the thing I traded off the most was that product context in my first 90 days. And again, it got me some things because I was able to have the time to go deep on the things I mentioned, but it didn't give me enough trust in the piggy bank around the actual product fundamentals or product, the actual thing we're building as opposed to the discipline.

Lenny (00:51:48):
So at this point you've worked at four legendary companies, Dropbox, Airbnb, WeWork, Webflow. If we were to just go through each one, what's just one lesson that you take away from each of these companies in terms of how it's informed either how you build product or lead people, anything along those lines?

Jiaona Zhang (00:52:06):
I'm going to actually give you my biggest thing across all four on the product side. And then on the people side. There are so many nuances also, and we could spend another two hours talking about each one of these. But I think just to impart my biggest high level learning. On the product side, it's about really understanding why people love you and not forgetting to invest deeply in that core concept and then building everything around that. And so I'll walk you through the different companies. So specifically for Dropbox, I think we did waste cycles where we would be like, "Oh, we see X happening in the market. Slack is really taking off. Why don't we build a Slack competitor? Or why don't we build chat?" And I think that it really missed this idea of, "Why do people love Dropbox and what do we need to do to continue investing in that so that remains true?" People love Dropbox for simplicity, for how delightful it is, how easy it is to use.

(00:53:08):
I think we actually went for a period of time where we didn't invest enough in just performance of our client. How long it takes for the thing to sync is a big part of the experience of using Dropbox. And so I think that is a big, big learning where it's really understanding that would've shifted your investments into doing that performance work as opposed to chasing the competitive space. And I think going back to chasing the competitive space, it's this idea of what is your alpha? Again, why do people come to you? People come to Dropbox again for all the things I mentioned, but also ultimately we have your files. So if you're going and building a chat product, that's fine, but really the best chat experience or collaboration experience is going to be more around your files as opposed to around just the conversation. So I think really understanding that is a huge, huge learning.

(00:54:01):
And I think that same lesson can be... It's very true for Airbnb. So at the end of the day, Airbnb is known for all the homes, the fact that these are homes that real people put on the platform. We spent some time talking about Airbnb Plus. When you are thinking "I got to go in and I got to manage the inventory and inspect it," you're almost like taking away from the thing that is what makes Air Airbnb special as opposed to leaning into it. We also spend a lot of time on experiences. We dabbled in transportation, we spent a bunch of times on other things. But if you really sat back and you're like, "What makes Air Airbnb special and how do you double down on your strength?" It's spending the time to make that experience of really understanding what's in a home so people don't go and get surprised. Making that onboarding journey for the host and then discovery journey and guest booking journey really, really great.

(00:54:52):
So I think that that same lesson when applied to Airbnb, would've in my head changed the way we invested and I think we would've gotten more returns, as opposed to spreading ourselves and then having things that sort of work but then didn't quite work. And then again, same principle applies to WeWork, what is the thing that makes you really special? It's the inventory it. It's not actually like, "Oh, it's so amazing that I get to use this key card and this key card does 10 different things." That's not what makes the WeWork experience special. And so again, if you knew that you wouldn't spend all that time being like, "I'm going to really deeply invest in the tech team, I'm going to do all these interesting things." You'd be like, "I just need to make inventory management great. I need to make it so that the sales team, the operations team, they have the tools they need to go out and get the inventory on the platform." You wouldn't do all this other stuff that's just not the core.

(00:55:44):
And then finally, even at Webflow, we are learning this lesson all the time where at the end of the day, people really love our designer. They love the fact that they can use it. It does so much for them, it's so powerful. And then you add our CMS and it's really powerful. You can design with data. So investing deeply there as opposed to spreading ourselves too thin is also a lesson. I think across so many companies this lesson around understand why people love you, double down on that and then whatever else you build around it... Because again, you don't want to also be like... You're not like a single product company, you're not like a one trick pony. You are going to invest in these multi products, but when you invest in a new product, really go back to, again, what's the core of our advantage and how can that be something we leverage in delivering a really great product experience for our users in X adjacent area or x add-on?

Lenny (00:56:34):
Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round.

Jiaona Zhang (00:56:38):
Okay.

Lenny (00:56:38):
What is the best advice that you've gotten that has transformed or impacted the way you build product or hire or lead? Does anything come to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (00:56:48):
I can't remember where I explicitly got this advice, but I feel like I got it in multiple forms and it just really sat with me. It's this idea of asking for help. I do think about that a lot because I think there are so many times when you're like, "Oh, I'm the leader of X thing, everyone's looking to me like the [inaudible 00:57:04] stops in me. I need to have my act together. I can't be asking for help. If I'm asking for help, is everyone feel like I don't know what I'm doing?"

(00:57:13):
And ever since I've been people managing, I've been pushing myself to be like, "I know it feels non-intuitive to go ask for help when everyone is looking to for you to give them advice, but if you don't ask for help, there's so many times where you're just going to be sitting there with your problems. Whatever you have in your mind is just not the global best thing and you have to go ask for help. You have to go ask for help from your partners, your peers, even your team, even being my team, I don't know. I really don't know. Here's the guidelines, here's how you might want to think about it, but I don't know the answer, you know the answer." Going out and getting mentorship. I think this idea of really being able to say, "Be honest about what you know and what you don't know and ask for help when you don't know something," that's probably the biggest thing that I hold as a core principle and just helps me build better products.

Lenny (00:58:03):
What's something that you've asked for help about recently as an example?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:06):
So I'm working on our product strategy for the next three years. I'm thinking a lot about how do we really leverage AI to support all of our service providers and support all our users who come into Webflow and have a hard time sometimes learning how to use our product. And so I'm not an AI expert, so asking for help from the founders, from external folks, from engineers to be like, "What's happening?" Every single week I feel like LLMs are changing. What's possible in the world is changing. And so constantly asking for help to iterate on the strategy is a huge part of... It's happening every day for me and my job.

Lenny (00:58:40):
JZ, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:44):
All right, let's do it.

Lenny (00:58:46):
What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:50):
I love the Design Sprint by Google. I also really Julie's book around managing people how to be a good manager. That one's really great. And so those are my more business side of the house books. And then we can also talk about fantasy stuff if you want. But-

Lenny (00:59:07):
Yeah, give us some recs there.

Jiaona Zhang (00:59:09):
I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson. He completed the Wheel of Time series on behalf of the [inaudible 00:59:14] author. He has the Mistborn series and so he's a great one. He actually has this... During the pandemic, he holed up and wrote a bunch of books and Vince was like, "I have a confession to make. I wrote four extra books." And the latest one is Tress by the Emerald Sea that I really love.

Lenny (00:59:32):
I saw the video of him sharing that news and he's just like, "I wrote a book during COVID" and then, "Okay, I wrote a second book and then, oh, I wrote a third book also" and it just keeps going.

Jiaona Zhang (00:59:43):
I think he was like, "I have a secret or I have a confession to make." And everyone was like, "Oh no, are you going to say that you have a ghost writer because you're so prolific?" And he's like, "Nope, I just wrote four more books."

Lenny (00:59:51):
What a beast. Next question on that topic a little bit. What's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you watched? And I know you said you don't get to watch much, but anything come to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:01):
I feel like every night I'm watching Sesame Street like songs. We don't do TV, but we do do YouTube songs. I honestly don't have an answer to that other than we watch the Elmo song and the ABC song with my three year old.

Lenny (01:00:18):
There's been a lot of parenting advice on this podcast with my child coming soon. And so this is very on brand. Before we started this, you mentioned the painting behind you is referenced in like Arcane, it's connected to or the show Arcane, which I imagine-

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:31):
Yes. I'm a big fan. So painted this a long time ago before Jinx and Vi were a thing, and when Arcane was made, both my husband and I were like, "What? How did we predict this? This is amazing." So it's a good one.

Lenny (01:00:45):
There we go. Some adult content. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:53):
I do like to do behavioral questions, just really understanding when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate ambiguity? Is a big one for me because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. So asking a lot of behavioral questions around that.

Lenny (01:01:14):
And is there anything specific you look for in their answer that tells you this is a good answer or not a good answer?

Jiaona Zhang (01:01:20):
Yeah. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity," but actually put a path forward. I think also looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs as opposed to being like, "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear." Because again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, "This is the path, this is how I learned why I put this path together." And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, "Hey, is this working? Is this not working?" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.

Lenny (01:02:12):
Awesome. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Jiaona Zhang (01:02:17):
I love... It's not recent, but I do love the SNOO and it's very top of mind because I just graduated my second son from the SNOO and it was a little bit like, "Oh my gosh, no more rocking of the baby." But I do think it does a good job of actually doing the thing and I'm also giving parents peace of mind.

(01:02:34):
The other thing I'm a big fan of, again, you'll see where my head's at, lots of child related things. Midjourney for your toddler is actually great because instead of it being absolute instant gratification of "I want to see a firetruck," and "Here you go, here's my phone." It's like, "Let's wait for Midjourney to create the firetruck." And specifically you can even tell Midjourney what you want. It could be like, "I would like it to be blue." He's obsessed with Jungle Book, "Wearing a fire hat next to a firetruck." And so you can actually create, and I do believe in the future, so much of what we are going to be doing as humans is literally what is the creative process? What's the idea? It's less about executing all the pieces of it, but it's so important to still be able to be like "This is the idea that I want to bring to life." And so I just think training that is huge.

Lenny (01:03:24):
Feels like you've just defined your three-year strategy for Webflow right there with AI.

(01:03:30):
Next question, what is something that you've changed in the way you build product that might be relatively minor that had a big impact in your team's ability to execute?

Jiaona Zhang (01:03:40):
There's so many different things that we've done at all the different companies. It really depends on the company. And what I mean by that is at a company like Webflow, where the tech stack is complex and where a given feature has so many different interactions, you're like "People depend on this workflow, this thing interacts with this thing. It's a whole platform." One of the biggest things we've been tweaking is like how do we do more of a tech spike at the beginning to be like, "Do we have a good sense of how difficult this is going to be? The unknowns? Can we get a little bit more detail on them so that we don't go down a path and be like, 'Oh, this doesn't make sense'?" So I feel like that that's a tweak in the process that has really made a big difference at a company like Webflow.

(01:04:20):
But when I look back to other companies, again, that might not be your biggest problem. Another problem could be like, "Hey, it's just so difficult to work with cross-functional partners and doing a little tweak in the process where you bring them in a kickoff meeting." That might be the thing that just changes that dynamic of how you work with teams. So it's really... I don't know if there's one thing, but it's almost like every day I'm thinking about small tweaks and process to make all of us more efficient.

Lenny (01:04:44):
Final question, what is your number one pro-tip for using Webflow and being successful with Webflow?

Jiaona Zhang (01:04:49):
My number one pro-tip is there's a lot of stuff coming out that I'm very excited about. I do think Webflow has traditionally had a high learning curve, and it's because we're a pro tool, we're a professional tool. We do really amazing stuff, so much power that we deliver you, but with that power has come with it's hard to learn. And so one of the things that I'm really excited about pro-tip for using Webflow in the future is we're really going to bring the magic of Webflow University, the magic of AI, all together so that you can just use and learn Webflow so much faster, learn webflow in the context of what you're doing as opposed to going into a different tab and looking for the Webflow University stuff. It's going to be in context to the product, being able to actually take action directly, prompting Webflow to be able to do things for you. It's just going to be so much easier in the future to use the product. That's what I'm excited about. We're working on it and it will be out in the future.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Okay. No specific dates yet. Yeah, you could share, this sounds like breaking news of cool stuff coming.

Jiaona Zhang (01:05:47):
Some things are in alpha and [inaudible 01:05:49] beta, but we do want to be developing it with our users and really learning is this the power that you're looking for? Is this thing that's going to get you over the activation hump that you've struggled with in the past?

Lenny (01:06:00):
JZ, I think we've made a maximally lovable podcast episode. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. How can listeners find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jiaona Zhang (01:06:11):
I always love feedback, so if there's feedback on the podcast, send it my way. Or even just what would you want to learn? Send it my way. And the reason I ask that is because I'm actually working on a course, another course through Reforge, which is around managing your PM career. And so really just... I've talked to so many people advice around their career, but if you want to reach out and be like, "These are the problems that I'm facing," it would actually really help me as I am creating this course, which is going to launch in a couple of months. And so I'm excited to... Find me there if you want to chat more and send the problems that you're struggling with when it comes to your career, and that would help me refine my course.

Lenny (01:06:47):
And that's just reforge.com? There's no URL yet specifically for that course?

Jiaona Zhang (01:06:51):
Not yet, but it will come soon. And maybe what I'll do is I'll post it on my website, which is built in Webflow, so my full name dotcom.

Lenny (01:06:59):
Got it. JZ, thank you so much for being here, and thanks again.

Jiaona Zhang (01:07:03):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:07:05):

# How embracing your emotions will accelerate your career | Joe Hudson (Art of Accomplishment)

## Transcript

Joe Hudson (00:00:00):
A lot of the people in my circles may have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange a life that they enjoy, and it doesn't fucking work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
What is holding people back?

Joe Hudson (00:00:09):
It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling, or expressing. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
What the hell? Why would... Why does this... You have this really amazing insight. The voice in your head is often telling you bullshit.

Joe Hudson (00:00:27):
What most people try to do is they try to stop it, and that doesn't work very well. I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day. One of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
You're really big on helping people feel joy.

Joe Hudson (00:00:45):
It's such an important tool for productivity. If you say, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient. Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone try to experiment with?

Joe Hudson (00:01:02):
Yeah, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Today, my guest is Joe Hudson. Joe is one of the most sought-after executive coaches amongst tech leaders and has worked with folks from OpenAI, SpaceX, Apple, and other world-class companies. Joe's unique approach to coaching draws from his spiritual, psychological, and neurological practices. In his intimate courses that he runs a few times a year, and in his podcast, he helps people create the life that they want with enjoyment and ease. In our conversation, Joe shares the two things that he finds most often keep people stuck in their life and in their job, and how to work on getting these things unstuck. Why the critical voice in your head is always wrong, contradictory, and telling you bullshit, and how to build a different relationship with that voice.

(00:01:51):
Why falling in love with your emotions is so important and so powerful. Why you'd be better off focusing on what you want versus what you think you should do or think that you need to do, plus a bunch of amazing advice on how to make better decisions, help your team run more effectively, and why a seven-minute daily gratitude practice will change your life. This episode is basically for every single person. It will make your life and your work better. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Joe Hudson. Joe, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Joe Hudson (00:02:34):
Oh, thanks. Good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:36):
It's good to have you. I'm curious if there's any common themes that emerge often in terms of what is holding people back from success or just living the life that they want, especially ambitious tech people, which I know is a lot of the folks that you work with. Are there archetypes of like, here's the thing, often come up most often and hold people back?

Joe Hudson (00:02:57):
A nonspecific answer to that would be a critical voice in their head and a relationship with that critical voice that is not productive. Oftentimes, the critical voice in the head says, "You need me to be productive," but it's usually a huge detriment to being able to really be successful. Even if you are successful with a really critical voice in your head, you never get to enjoy it. You might have the money, but then you're like, "Oh, shit, I'm still miserable." Or, "I got the car, I got the house, I got the money, I got the successful career, and why am I unhappy all the time?" That would be, I would say one of the biggest ones. Another really big one that in a large category I would say is their relationship with emotions is all fakata. They are either trying to pretend they don't have them or compartmentalizing them or trying to manage them rather than harnessing them and falling in love with them. That would be a big place.

Okay, so the voice in your head, you have this really amazing insight that I heard on one of your podcast episodes that the voice in your head is often wrong, often contradictory, often telling you, and that your advice is to learn how to work very differently with this voice in your head, which a lot of people just assume, oh, that's just like what it is. It's telling me how it's trying to help me, but it turns out it's not. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:07:04):
I would say every single time the voice in your head is wrong. That critical voice in your head. To be specific, I'm talking about the voice in your head that is critical and repeats. There's the voice that says the same thing over and over again. You got to work out more, you got to work out more, you got to work out more. Whatever that is, it's always wrong, and that doesn't mean there isn't truth to what it says, but it's incorrect. As an example of this, you should work out more, you should work out more, you should work out more, or you need me or you just sit around on the couch as a great example of one. If I was your boss and I was sitting right next to you and I was criticizing you every couple of minutes, there's no way that you would say, "Wow, I really need you. I couldn't be productive without you." It's a bunch of crap. Or you should work out, you should work out.

(00:07:58):
I see the truth that I'd be healthier if I work out. I get that. Should I? Is it really a should? There's another question. What makes it not say, "Oh, hey, why don't you enjoy working out? How do we get you to enjoy working out? What would motivate you to work?" It's not doing any of that. It's, "You should work out, you should work out." It's never an accurate thing that's happening inside of your head. Until you can see through that, it's hard to work with the voice in your head. You can do it, but until you see through it. The second part that I would say is that if you want to work with the voice in your head a new way, what most people try to do is they try to stop it. They try to control the voice in the head, and that doesn't work very well. Instead, I say, change the way that you relate to the negative voice in your head.

(00:08:46):
Instead of being, "Okay, stop doing that, stop doing that." Say, "Oh, I see that you're really scared and I'm right here with you." Or sing a musical to it or just go, "Eh, I don't believe you." As a matter of fact, I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day to have an experimental approach and say, "Oh, what's the relationship I want with this negative voice in my head?" Because right now, what it's typically doing for most people is that it says something and the person's like, "Yeah." Or, "Yeah, but I'm not going to do that, so fuck off." Or, "Yeah, that'll never work." Something like that is the response. What happens if you change the response to the voice in your head? That gives you a crap ton of freedom, and it's the beginning of what can be a state where the negative voice in the head disappears, which is really, really quite lovely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):
Oh, wow. I love this so much because there's so much that comes from this thing in your head just shooting you down or scaring you about stuff. It's so hard. I hear this, but it's so hard. Next time I'm, I don't know, giving a big presentation, I'm going to hear like, "Oh, something could go wrong. You could look really stupid or you could totally forget what you're saying." It's hard to really intellectualize, okay, I don't have to listen to this. Is there anything more there just how to turn that around and be like, just shut up?

Joe Hudson (00:10:11):
The shut up usually doesn't work. Experiment with all of it. To me, one of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you." Because part of the deal is that the voice in the head has assumed the position that it's like the boss, but it's really a little kid having a temper tantrum. If you listen to it, if you just dictated everything it said, it sounds like usually like a five-year-old having a temper tantrum, or it sounds like the way your mom used to chastise you or the way your dad used to chastise you or whatever, a teacher. It isn't, it's not logical, it's not thoughtful, it's typically not thoughtful, it's usually abusive. It's a lot of fear. It's one of my favorites, one of my favorite ways to respond.

(00:11:06):
I've tried, I mean, gosh, dozens of ways, and there's a lot of neat effective ways. I particularly think it's really good to set up a series of experiments rather than just take the one that I have because the experimental mindset means that you can never really fail. Typically, somebody, like worse with the voice in the head, they fail and they go, "Ah, fuck it." Because we have this part of our brain called the habenula, and the habenula basically is the part of our brain that is trying to teach us not to fail over and over again. It's the thing that when you go on a diet or you go to work out and then you don't do it one day and you say, "Ah, fuck it, I messed up," and then you don't try anymore or you don't try for a couple of weeks or whatever, that's basically what's happening in that part of the brain.

(00:11:48):
If you do it as an experimental thing, then you can't lose, you're just learning about yourself. You're learning about the voice in your head. The way I like thinking about that is people are like, "I understand the problem, but I don't have a solution." I'm always like, "If you understood the problem, there would be no question about the solution." If you fully understand the problem, you know the solution. All you have to do is really fully understand the voice in your head through a series of experiments and the whole thing goes away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
The advice here is next time you're hearing something in your head that you don't think is going to be helpful to you is try to respond to it in a different way from what you've been doing.

Joe Hudson (00:12:25):
I would be even more subtle than that, which is I really wouldn't care if you think it's helpful to you or not. I would just experiment with different ways of interacting with it. I wouldn't even do it as a goal of, okay, I want the voice in the head to be nicer to me. I would do it with the goal of just, hey, how do I learn? How do I understand this thing? It's a far more productive self-development. Generally, it's far more productive to learn, say about the river valley by walking through it, putting your feet in the river, going down the river with a canoe, smelling the soil, looking at the plants, than it is to say, "Okay, I am going to dam this river valley and try to..." You're not going to understand it the same way. You're going to make some mistakes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
Amazing. The second bucket that you shared of what you find most often is the root of what's holding people back is the way you described is your relationship with your emotions, which I don't think a lot of people would think of as the thing that's holding them back. Can you talk a bit more about what that looks like?

Joe Hudson (00:13:31):
Yeah, a great way to explain it. For the logical folks, so in 2012 or so, there was a person who wrote a book called Descartes' Error, and in Descartes' Error, the whole idea is that I think therefore I am, and this person's like, "Yeah, that's the error." It's a neuroscientist who looked at people who had damage in the emotional center of their brain, and they just basically ceased to be able to make decisions. Their IQ would stay the same, but it would take them half an hour to decide where to have lunch or decide what color pen to use. It would take hours and hours to make simple decisions, so their IQ would stay high, but their entire life would completely fall apart. What it tells us, and this is not exact, I'm paraphrasing for a podcast, but we make decisions in the emotional center of our brain. We use logic to try to figure out how we're going to feel.

(00:14:23):
You can see this just by asking yourself the question, how many decisions have you made to feel like a success or to not feel like a failure or to feel happier, to not feel trapped? There's these huge buckets of emotions that we are trying to feel and not feel, and we're making decisions based on those. There's no such thing as a logical decision. That idea is like, I'm just going to be logical and just make a logical decision, it doesn't. Neurologically, it's just untrue. If you learn to fall in love with all of your emotions, then solution sets become available that you didn't have before. If you are like, "Oh, I can't feel like a failure." Well, then you're probably not going to take certain risks. If you are, "Oh, I want to feel loved and I can't feel unliked by people." Well, then you're not going to say your truth, and then the world is going to not give you the things that are truthful to you.

(00:15:20):
I go into my boss, I say my truth, I get fired. Okay, I get fired, but then probably my next boss, I say my truth, I'm going to find a location where my truth is and how I want to be in the world is going to be acceptable. If I don't do that, if I'm constantly managing myself, then I'm not going to have that reality. It's really important, just for the decision-making part, how important emotions are to be able to fall in love with each of the emotional experiences so you're not making decisions based on your inability to feel stuff. That's like one, there's literally a thousand others. Most people, they feel stuck. They can have a big emotional release and they don't feel stuck anymore. When people feel overwhelmed, it's usually not the amount of crap that they have going on in their life. It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling or expressing. That's another huge chunk of stuff.

(00:16:11):
Depression is usually unmoved anger, is another example. There's so many levels in which people not able to feel really limits their life. Just one that's like almost everybody can relate to is feeling excitement is something that most people can only do for about 10 to 20 seconds. Most people aren't like, "Oh, I'm excited." If you walked into a Denny's and there was this person, a 60-year-old man and just excited and was excited for 10 minutes, you'd be like, "What's wrong with this person?" When we're excited, it's contagious. I walk into a meeting and I'm excited, probably other people are going to walk out excited. We're limiting just our ability to create collaboration by the fact that we're limited by our excitement. I could go on forever. There's so many experiences like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):
What I'm hearing is the core issues, we're not able to feel our emotion, but there's something there, like we are angry or scared. Because we can't feel it, we just can't break through that.

Joe Hudson (00:17:17):
Not quite. If you have somebody who's experienced a lot of emotional abuse in their life, then they might not be able to feel the emotions that they're having, and particularly where you experienced the emotional abuse. That might be the case for them. For instance, if you had physical abuse and I put a quarter in one of your hands and a key in another one of your hands without telling you which was which, you wouldn't be able to tell me if you'd suffered enough physical abuse because you've literally cut that sensation off. Similarly, people who've experienced emotional abuse can often not tell what the emotions are. Now, emotional abuse is, it's a big word. Generally, people don't even like equating the two. Just to agree on terms here, when I say emotional abuse, I mean you were told that you weren't allowed to have a certain emotion. That's what I mean by emotional abuse.

(00:18:08):
Maybe you got fed every time you got angry or you got your love removed, or you got punished, or maybe every time you cried, you were made fun of. My particular background was that. It's when you weren't allowed to feel certain emotions, you were told to cut it off because it wasn't going to be safe because you're either going to get bribed out of it or punished out of it, or loved removed because of it or made fun of or whatever it is. That might be a step that one has to take, but the place you want to get to is where the emotions are fluid, where it just moves right through you. It doesn't mean that you lose control. As a matter of fact, losing control means that there's still resistance in it.

(00:18:53):
The way I think about this is that emotions are like a tube, let's say, and there's water moving through the tube. You kink a tube one way, the water comes out a little funny. Kink the tube the other way, it comes a little funny. Let's say you have anger and that's the tube of, and you kink it one way and it's like, "You son of a bitch. You blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." You kink get another way and it's like, "Nice dress. You crank it another way and it's guilt. It's like, "Why would you ever do that to me?" Then if it's unkinked, then it's like Gandhi or Martin Luther king. It's this very loving boundary that's set. It's this clarity of purpose. That's how I think about it. The idea is to get to fluidity, to unkink the hose so that all of the emotional experiences come out with love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:44):
I did a meditation retreat, a 10-day silent meditation retreat, which I know is a big part of your practice and something that led to the work you do now. A term that's coming up for me is non-judgmental awareness. Basically, experiencing the thing you're feeling and just letting it go, not attaching to it, not judging it. Is that along the lines of stuff you'd recommend?

Joe Hudson (00:20:03):
Yeah, it's definitely a huge part of it. There's a couple of things that I noticed get in the way, or the translation gets in the way there. One is it's like, think about emotions as like kids in your house. If a kid came into your house and you're like, "I will be non-judgmentally aware of you." You're probably going to get a very different response from the kid than if you're like, "Oh, I'm so excited to see you. I welcome you in my house." The emotions feel different if you're like, "I am non-judgmentally aware of this emotion," or, "Oh, cool. Oh cool, I'm sad. This is fantastic." If you have that welcoming invitation. One of the quotes that I'm most famous for is joy is the matriarch of a family of emotions and she won't come into a house where her children aren't welcome. A very joyful life is a life where all the other emotions are deeply welcomed, not accepted, not non-judgmentally aware of. I think those are really great steps, don't get me wrong. If you can be in non-judgmental awareness of an emotion, fantastic.

(00:21:14):
The other thing that's a little bit different about what you said is that emotions do need to be felt. If you stop feeling an emotion, you have to constrict your muscles. I can watch somebody come in, come up for one of my coaching rapid coaching sessions. By the crease in their eyebrow, I can know that there's repressed anger. By the hunch in their shoulders, I can tell you about the critical parent that they had. The body takes on a shape that's based on the emotions that you've been taught to hold. You don't just by sitting there, well, it's not entirely true, if you just sit there and feel them in that way without the full expression, they will move eventually, but it might take a couple of decades. You can actually just move them. You can actually make the sound, move your body. All mammals do it. Like mammals releasing fear, they all shake. It's part of how we exist. That's also a really big part of emotional fluidity. It's not just being still and feeling them, it's letting the muscles move, making the sounds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
For someone that wants to get better at the skill of feeling emotions, being more in touch with emotions, helping their emotions be more fluid. I know this is a lifelong practice and not something you would just hear on a podcast, okay, I've installed this. Is there anything tactically you can recommend to a listener of just like, here's something you could do this week that'll help you, along these lines?

Joe Hudson (00:22:40):
We have a free audio on our website called Emotional Inquiry, and that would be the easiest way that I would, that's a really good entry level first step into emotional fluidity. The bigger problem is that every step has a different thing. If you're in the not aware of emotions, then that step may not be the right step for you. Though, if you are aware two or three emotions and you can do emotional inquiry, usually, it'll open up a lot of the other ones. There might be a point where you really need expression, and so emotional inquiry is not going to work. Just generally, the emotional inquiry practice is a really good one. What it is, is imagine you're a little kid and you pick up a toad.

(00:23:28):
You're going to pick it up, you're going to look at it, you're going to feel it, you're going to smell it. Some little kids are even going to lick it a little bit. They're going to really want to explore this toad, and that's what emotional inquiry is, is a somatic mental experiencing of an emotional experience in your body and what is it like and what happens when you welcome it. What happens when you love it. What happens when you resist it. It's a series of experiments that you're playing with the emotion and observations and felt sense of the emotion, and that I find to be incredibly, incredibly useful for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):
Just getting very curious.

Joe Hudson (00:24:06):
Yeah, a lot of wonder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
By the way, the quote you shared about joy being the matriarchy of all the other emotions, imagine people have said this, but inside out too, I think is exactly a representation of what you're talking about, where joy is actually, she's like the protagonist almost. I don't know if you've seen it yet.

Joe Hudson (00:24:25):
I think I've heard about this. I haven't watched it, but I think where you think it's all about being happy and you find out that you have to accept everything for happiness to really work, kind of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
Exactly.

Joe Hudson (00:24:35):
Yeah, I have heard about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):
Anxiety takes over, and then things don't go well. Something else that I've noticed listening to a bunch of your conversations, you do these lightning round coaching sessions with people, and so I listen to a bunch of them. Something that was really interesting to me is that a lot of people come to you and they're like, "Hey, I have this problem. I can't do this hard thing I know I need to do." Or, "I have imposter syndrome just keeping me from doing this thing I need to do." you're often like, "No, that's not actually what's going on here. I can see that's not a problem for you. It's really this other thing." Is that super common where people think they need to work on this one thing, and it turns out that's not at all, they're actually okay at that and something totally else?

Joe Hudson (00:25:13):
I'd maybe put it a little bit differently. They're living in a story that describes an old version of themselves or they don't see themselves clearly enough to be able to see the whole issue, and so they're just kind of living with a story that's in the past. That's a really common thing. Oftentimes, if I do that in a coaching session, typically it's because they're showing me right there that it's not true. Somebody's like, "I'm so scared, I can't do anything." I'm like, "You just got in front of a hundred people to ask me a question. Clearly, you're not so scared that you can't do anything, so I'm not buying it." I don't do it quite like that, I do it with a lot more love than that.

(00:25:54):
Oftentimes, I see that people's stories are a culprit, like how they describe themselves. A great way that you can really see this in folks is that nine out of 10 times that you compliment somebody, I really appreciate this thing about you, they're going to go, "Nah." Or, "Well, my sister is even more." Or, "If you knew me." They're going to do some sort of version like that. It basically is one of the indicators that they can't actually feel who they are. They would rather, in effect, call you a liar. You're lying to me or you're wrong than they would to actually accept the experience of being seen in that way. It does a couple of things. One of the things it does is it stops people from seeing themselves clearly. The other thing it does is it makes people forever want to be seen and complimented and acknowledged and validated because they're getting the food, but they can't digest it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Do you have any advice other than working with you and you telling them, "Hey, here's actually going on," for someone to like, okay, maybe revisit, maybe this isn't actually a problem to see what's actually going on?

Joe Hudson (00:27:09):
We have a set of five kind of what we think are foundational tools for transformation, and we do these free workshops on them, and one of them is question the assumption. That's a really great way to have people start to see through their stories. At the beginning, I said, "Nothing in the critical voice in your head says is true." This is how it applies, so typically, there's an assumption that you have to make for the problem to be real. If somebody says to you, for instance, if somebody comes to me and says, "I am an asshole to my girlfriend." That's their problem. One, you have to assume that the girlfriend doesn't want you to be an asshole, as an example. Two, you have to assume that you know what being an asshole actually is. It's not just what your mom told you an asshole was.

(00:28:04):
Three, there's some validation, there's another assumption, there's some clear thing that says this in the world. Everyone's like, that's an asshole and that's not, rather than what actually happens in the world, which is 50% of the people think that this person is an asshole and 50% think they're a hero. It's something like that. Also, another assumption there is that the problem is that you're an asshole, instead of that you're resisting the fact that you are an asshole, and therefore, it comes out sideways instead of really clear. There's so many assumptions in there. If you see through those assumptions, usually the problem starts fading away.

(00:28:40):
It's like, "Oh, okay, what do I mean by asshole, exactly? How do I define that?" It seems like a silly thing when I am using this example of asshole. I remember this moment in my own development, I was in Bodega Bay, out of all places, and this very good friend of mine at the time was like, "Joe, you're an asshole." I was like, "No, I'm not." He's like, "Why resist it? Just fall in love with the fact that you're an asshole. Just allow yourself to be an asshole for just a minute, just one minute." I stopped, and I thought of like, I was doing venture capital at the time, and I could think of all the things that I had done that somebody would call an asshole, and all the ways in which I was unattuned to people, and I could, "Oh, yeah, okay, I can totally see that I'm an asshole."

(00:29:32):
In that scene, not only in the scene of it, but as the shame fell away, oh, this is nothing I have to defend. This isn't something that I'm a bad person because of, I don't need to be ashamed of it. This is just some actions that I took. As that faded away, then and then over the next couple weeks, lo and behold, I became less of an asshole. It's a strange thing when you really grok that, that it's often shame that holds bad habits in place. Is it a problem that I'm an asshole, or is the problem that I'm ashamed of being an asshole? Is the problem that you're a smoker, is the problem that you're ashamed of being a smoker? Typically, there's so many assumptions built into everything that we call a problem, and if we look through those assumptions, the problems disappear. As in this case, it disappeared for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Wow, okay. There's a lot there. It connects to something I know you recently talked about, which is the emotion we want to avoid is the thing we end up experiencing a lot by trying to avoid it. What's going on there?

Joe Hudson (00:30:46):
Since I'm coach executives, let's do an executive example, so conflict avoidant executive. I don't want to feel the out of control in this that I do when people argue. I don't want to feel that level of out of control, so I am going to be conflict avoidant. I'm going to avoid conflict. Every way that we go to avoid a feeling, becomes the way that, that feeling gets invited towards us. We all know what it's like to work for a conflict-avoidant CEO or a boss, people get really fucking upset. Eventually, people get really upset. Decisions aren't being made. There's all this tension. It's never relieved.

(00:31:30):
Then wow, sure enough, the conflict-avoidant CEO is dealing with a whole organization that's tense and they feel completely out of control and the fact that they can't do anything about, so that's an example. Or when I was younger, it was emotional abandonment. My dad was an alcoholic, and I didn't want to feel that emotional abandonment again, and so I would get really hard when I felt like people were leaving me, I'd be like, "What the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah?" Which of course, made them abandon me quicker, or I would try to caretaker people, which would build resentment, which would make people abandon me. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
What the hell? Why does this happen?

Joe Hudson (00:32:14):
That doesn't sound right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
This is counterproductive.

Joe Hudson (00:32:20):
It is counterproductive. I think that the really cool thing about it is you can look at any issue that you're having in your life, so you can say, oh, one of the problems that I have in my life is that I am constantly in an argument with my girlfriend or boyfriend, let's say. What is the thing that you don't want to feel in that argument? I don't want to feel ashamed. You're getting in arguments because you don't want to feel ashamed, and that's making you feel more ashamed. What am I doing at that first time to not feel ashamed? I'm defending myself. Oh, and me defending myself is actually the thing that's starting the fight. You can backward engineer it to, oh, I don't want to feel ashamed, therefore I'm going to defend myself, which creates the fight, which makes me feel more ashamed.

(00:33:10):
Any problem that you're having, you can actually backwards engineer it and see, oh, I can solve that problem by just being okay with that feeling. God damn it, you didn't take out the trash. Oh, that's a shame I don't want to feel. I'm not going to defend myself. I'm going to feel that shame. Oh, yeah, then maybe I'm going to say I'm sorry I didn't take out the trash, or I'm going to say, I don't feel ashamed, I don't want to take out the trash. I have to defend myself to get in the fight, and then I'm going to feel ashamed. You can reverse engineer all your problems this way. It's like it's such a cool hack, but it's very hard. For somehow or another, it's very simple, but very hard for people to utilize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:53):
This is amazing. The advice is basically feel the thing and just come to terms with this is the emotion I'm feeling, and maybe, like an example, the asshole. Well, maybe I'm an asshole.

Joe Hudson (00:34:03):
It's what's required for you to love and accept yourself would be, and love and accept the emotion that you're having in the moment instead of resist it. There's that saying, what we resist persists. How do you fall in love with and stop resisting the reality on the ground? In doing so, it changes the reality on the ground.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):
In this argument with your supposed girlfriend, say you disagree about her perspective on what's going on. I guess that's not the root issue here. It's your feeling, it's not her perception.

Joe Hudson (00:34:41):
Hey, sweetheart, I really hear you want me to take out the trash, and that's not my truth. That's going to be very different than defending that shame. The defending the shame is going to be like, no, it's not my job to take out the chat. You're trying not to feel the experience, which is what's going to do it. The response isn't the important thing. It's really where the response comes from. It's so interesting because people are taught constantly, this is something we teach in the connection courses that it's really not about the conversation, it's about where you're at in the conversation. For instance, when my friend said to me, "Hey, you're a dick." Here's what he didn't do, he's like, he didn't go, "You're a dick. You asshole. You're being an asshole. You're being a dick. Fucking stop it." He was like, "Eh, you're a dick, so what? What's the problem?" He was coming from a place of love for me, and so I could not be defended in my response to him. It's really where you come from.

(00:35:49):
It's the emotionally where you come from, that's the important part. Not as much what you say. You can see this, a perfect example of this is, this happens all the time in my work. Let's say there's a person who has a CEO and the person is scared of their CEO. Let's say this is the CMO, and they're, "I'm scared of the CEO. I can't say my truth. They're always getting upset. They're going to yell, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." I'll say, yeah, there's one person who says it though. The answer is always yes. That CEO has one person who they don't yell at, who they listen to, who they'll take the objection from, that they don't get angry with. It's because there's somebody who doesn't approach them in fear. It's because somebody approaches them a different way. Not with judgment, but like, "Hey, look, this is what we have to pay attention to." It's really about how you're coming at it and not what you're saying typically.

I'm very happy with what advice we've already shared and there's more I want to tap into.

Joe Hudson (00:38:04):
You keep using the word advice, and I just want to, so for anybody who's listening, do not take my advice. Do not, do not, do not. Test it. Experiment. Set up an experiment, try it out. See if it's true for you. It's one, I just made this shit up. Somebody else could make up something different. It's like Jeff Bezos made up Amazon. We make stuff up, but we're humans. Two, is if you instead of just listen to it as a soundbite, if you actually do it and make an experiment out of it, you get to learn. It's in your bones. You get to see what's actually real for you. What's real for you in this moment might not be real for you what's in the next moment. For instance, I could give the advice that says, hey, you can't even control your thoughts.

(00:38:55):
You can't even decide what thought you are going to have next is, it's just going to fucking happen. you're completely out of control, and so it's all a gift. Can you look at life as all a gift? Wow, that could be really useful for one person, but the other person, they feel so disempowered that they're like, "I can't even control my own thoughts. Man, I am totally trapped." They might really need at that moment to learn that, "Oh, I have empowerment, I have choice." That's the advice that they need to hear. Do the experiment, find out what's true for you in this moment. If there's a piece of advice, that's the one I want to give.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:40):
let's share more experiments people can run. Another is this thread that I feel comes up a lot in your work is you're just really big on helping people feel joy. Feels like that's the core of what you're trying to help people is feel more joy. Why is that so important? Why is joy so important, so powerful?

Joe Hudson (00:39:57):
I definitely would not want anyone to feel joy. I wouldn't want to push somebody into or like, "Hey, you should feel joy." What I would say that's a close cousin to that is that enjoyment is such an important tool for productivity. Enjoyment is such an important tool for living a meaningful life. Enjoyment is an amazing tool. As an example, let's say you drive a Ferrari, you're not going to say, hey, that's an efficient car. That's a super-efficient car. You're going to say, no, that's a fast car. Somehow in our own lives, if we get something done quickly, we're efficient, but that's not efficient. You can go and get something done quickly and then you're so exhausted. What's efficient is if at the end of whatever you did, you feel like you have more energy, like you're stoked, like, oh, I can't wait to do this again tomorrow. That's efficiency, is that you've actually used the least amount of energy to get something done. If you say, oh, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient.

(00:41:13):
Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too. If you enjoy running, you're probably going to run more than if you don't enjoy running. If you enjoy doing a podcast, you're probably going to make a better podcast and you're going to do it for longer if you enjoy doing it. There's something really, really important about enjoyment because it's not only a measure of efficiency, it also has a strong correlation with hire in most things has a strong correlation with how long you're going to do it, your staying power, the quality of what you're going to do, all of that. That's one of the reasons that I think enjoyment is really great. The other thing is that if you enjoy things, they feel different. I think one of the things that people do is they say this, they say, "I want to enjoy my life more, so I'm going to do less things, take out the trash, and I'm going to do more things like go on vacation."

(00:42:14):
That's not how enjoyment works. You can enjoy taking out the trash or you can hate taking out the trash. That's a choice. Right now, somebody listening to this as an experiment that they can run is like, okay, you're going to stay listening to this for the next minute. How do you enjoy it 10% more? Typically, what will happen is somebody will take a deeper breath, they'll settle into their body a little bit more, they'll relax a little bit more. They might physically get more comfortable. There's a thousand things that they might do to just enjoy the experience 10% more. That, and in that, they're becoming more efficient in that the quality is getting better in that they're hearing what I'm saying differently. It's just a really powerful tool. What I know the problem to be is that some people will go, "Okay, now I have to enjoy life. I'm going to disregard all these negative emotions so that I'm in enjoyment." That doesn't work. It's horrendous. It's just a recipe for shit stew.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):
Along these lines, how much of the work is learning to enjoy the thing you're doing more versus finding something that you innately enjoy? Which one is more powerful? I guess, which do you point people to? Which experiments do you find people should run more?

Joe Hudson (00:43:31):
In our society, typically, it's how to enjoy what you're doing more. What happens typically is that if you find a way to enjoy the thing that you're doing more, you're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. It's just an order of operations thing. As compared to there's people, a lot of the people in my circles because of who I coach and everything, they're billionaires and they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange life that they enjoy and it doesn't fucking work. They actually have more power to make everything that they're doing exactly what they want to do, but that doesn't work. Flying the jet or buying the island or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, doesn't do it.

(00:44:25):
Whereas if you really learn to enjoy what's in front of you, all of a sudden, one thing that happens is that you're not as scared of enjoyment. You start saying, "Oh, wow, enjoyment makes me really effective, and so I'm want to do the things that I enjoy." You're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. Instead of having this story, I have to do X, Y, and Z so that at one point in the future, I can do what I enjoy. It's just an order of operations things. If you learn to enjoy the things that you're doing, you're going to naturally start doing the things you enjoy. If you only do the things you enjoy, you will not learn how to enjoy what you're doing very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:03):
You show this tip of how can I enjoy this 10% more? Just ask yourself, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:09):
Yes, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
Is there anything else that you find helpful for helping? Yeah, right now, how can I enjoy this 10% right now?

Joe Hudson (00:45:14):
That's right. It's not about changing anything in the external world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):
Got it. Internally, what can I do? What can I change about the way I'm experiencing this?

Joe Hudson (00:45:23):
Yeah. I like to ask it as how do you enjoy it 10% more, because if it's what can I change, then there's trying, trying is usually not more enjoyment. It's actually usually letting go of trying that creates more enjoyment. The phrasing can really make or break the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):
Enjoy it 10% more. Say someone's sitting in a boring meeting that's really sucking their soul, look, they should ask themselves this question, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:51):
Well, should, they can. They get to, it's a great experiment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:54):
It's an experiment. Okay, perfect.

Joe Hudson (00:45:58):
The reason I do the should thing is that as soon as you say you should and then you don't then you can fail. If you fail, then you're less likely to try it again. That's why the should, it ends up usually in stagnation. If you think about the way it feels in your body when you say, I should do something, and there's a stagnation, there's a, hmm. whereas if you say something like, oh, I want to do it, or here's an experiment I can do, or here's what I enjoy, there's less stagnation, there's more movement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:31):
This touches on something else that you talk a lot about, and we've been circling around this idea of authenticity versus improvement, where you help people realize that you are good as you are, you don't need to necessarily improve. We've talked a lot about these sorts of things already, but just what else can you share there just how to help people learn this?

Joe Hudson (00:46:49):
My favorite metaphor on this one is at what time in the journey of an oak tree is it perfect? Is it when it's an acorn, when it's sprout, when it's 20 years old, 40 years old, 150 years old, 200 years old, depending on the oak tree? Now, I'm perfect. The idea is ridiculous. It's a similar thing for us. The idea that I need to improve myself, it really disturbs the natural process that's at hand, which is we evolve. We as human beings evolve. If it's like, oh, I'm evolving and I can enjoy it, and I'm acting from my authenticity, then that has a lot of alacrity. That moves quick. If it's I need to improve, there's something wrong with me, I need to improve, I should do it, that all goes really fucking slow. Because there's a lot of emotional stagnation in that.

(00:47:55):
There's a lot of should shame. There's a lot of stagnation in that, and so you don't actually get that natural flow of life. The Taoist talk about this as kind of like a river always finds its way, it just always goes in that direction. We are naturally evolving. That is our nature. Then to put a whole bunch of shoulds and shits in the way just slows the process down. The other thing about authenticity that I think is really important too, is that if you are one of the few people, I'd say 10, 15%, who can say, I should be this way, this way, and this way, and then you do it, which is very few people can actually do that. What most people do is they say, I should do this, should do that, should do that, and then a decade later, they're still saying they should do the same things. Let's say you're one of those really successful people, then you have a life for not you. Then you have a life of who you think you should be, not for who you actually are.

(00:49:02):
If you move from authenticity, naturally, certain things aren't going to work, certain things are going to work. Certain people are going to work, certain people aren't going to work. Certain jobs are going to work. The ones that you end up with over time are going to be the ones that are right for you, not right, for who you think you should be. The most obvious of this is you meet a woman and you're like, oh, this is how I should be for them to love me, and you just do it. You just do everything that you think you should do, and then you get married, and then they love not you, they love who you think you should be. They don't love who you are. What kind of marriage is that? As opposed to, this is who I am and I'm going to be as genuine. I'm going to show you all my parts. I'm going to be as genuine as I can with you. Then if you do get married, you're married to the right person, you're married to the person who actually sees all that and loves that and wants that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:01):
How do you hold that idea with I also want to get better, I want to develop myself, I want to feel my emotions more, those sorts of things?

Joe Hudson (00:50:10):
I love that I want to, the better part is kind of just, gets a little bit in the way. We all want to, like a little kid wants to run faster. They might want to be a better runner, but the part that they missed, the reason that they develop so fucking quickly is because they don't think they're going to be a better person if they run faster. The idea is like, yeah, you have this natural want, that want is the thing that moves evolution. A plant is like, "Oh, there's sun. I want to move in that direction." As compared to I should. Both of them are human concepts, but the want, it's the thing that what allows us to know that's our evolutionary path. Oh, I have this want to be closer to people. Oh, I have this want for great sex. Oh, I have this want for being able to have a business that supports me.

(00:51:07):
These are great wants, and they show where the growth is occurring or wants to occur. It's like that's our natural evolution. It's great. What makes it need to be better? I want to be better. It just slows it down instead of, it's like saying that what I am is broken and therefore, the whole thing slows down. We try to word everything as more in the experimental framework, but also, we try to word everything as self-awareness, self-experimentation, self-discovery, instead of self-improvement. Because if you understand the problem, then the problem goes away. Just explore it. Just understand it as compared to making a list of things that you should do to get better, that you will eventually fail and then you'll just be stuck in this should loop where you beat yourself up and where most people hang out a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):
The experiment here that I'm taking away is think more about your want versus the should, and then things you think you need is okay.

Joe Hudson (00:52:20):
Because typically, when you say, I want to improve, it means the subtext in that is once I do X, Y, and Z, then I'm lovable. Once I do X, Y and Z, then I'm okay. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be worthy. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be enlightened, whatever the fuck, the thing is. That's just not how it works. What works is the person who loves themselves has loving relationships. It's not the person who's done X, Y, and Z so that they can be lovable, has loving relationships. The people who do X, Y and Z, so they can be lovable have relationships where people are critical and constantly telling them that they have to be better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:01):
Coming back, you just said this interesting quote that you also shared at the beginning. This idea, once we understand the problem, it goes away.

Joe Hudson (00:53:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):
Let's make sure people understand what that means. Is it related to this idea once you feel like I'm an asshole, okay, and then like, oh, okay, and then it starts to kind of away, is that the core?

Joe Hudson (00:53:15):
I just mean practically. It's like, can you really fully understand a problem if you don't understand the solution to it? There's a principle, and I can't remember the name of it, like it's Strickland principle or something. It's something that this CFO that I used to work with said, and he would say, "Problems get solved if you spend time on them. If you just give enough attention to a problem, the problem will solve." That's the way it works in business. An unsolvable problem, obviously, it's not going to work that way. The reason that, that works is because the more you spend time on a problem, the more you understand it.

(00:53:58):
Another one, love him or hate him, one of the things that Elon Musk has said that I found it very valuable in my time, is that if you really want to interview somebody and they claim that they've done something, you ask them six levels down. You improved sales. How did you do that, exactly? Well, we improved the pipeline. How'd you do that, exactly? Oh, well, we made the pipeline more measurable by having things that could be. How did you know? What were the seven stages of the pipeline and what made you pick them? You go six levels down and you can really understand if somebody was the person who solved the problem or if they're the person who is claiming that they solved the problem. It's the same thing.

(00:54:47):
If we just explore a problem enough, the solution is apparent. If we understand the problem enough, the solution is apparent. Typically, if we come to a problem with a kid's mind, wonder, if we come to it, what could I learn here? What's exciting? What are the experiments I can run? Then typically, that's the most efficient way, enjoyable way to solve a problem as compared to, I have to get to this problem by this time and we're going to do it this way. Usually, that doesn't work. I could geek out on why that lets democracies win over autocracies because they're far more experimental by nature, and it's not one person saying how things are going, but just generally, just we're more efficient when we're exploring. We're more efficient when we're exploring ourselves and understanding ourselves and trying to improve ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:46):
There's a couple of more experiments I want to help people try to run. One is you have some really good advice around decision-making and how emotions and getting better at understanding and working with your emotions helps you make better decisions. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:55:59):
That's similar to what I said before, which is if you learn to fall in love with the emotional experiences, then you have more solution sets. Let's say I want to have all human beings, I want to be a part of a great team. Nobody has ever raised their hand and said, "I'd like to be a part of a team." Yet, grand majority of people at their work right now have shitty teams or not A teams, not great teams, even though nobody wants that. If one of the things you're unwilling to feel is that conflict, that tension, as we talked about if you're conflict avoidant, you're not going to be able to make an A team because there's nothing that is alive doesn't require tension. A cell requires tension. Breathing requires tension. Playing pickleball requires tension. A good team requires tension. If you're going to avoid that experience, you're not going to be as easily, if at all, be able to create a quality team.

(00:57:05):
To be able to look forward to any emotional experience, creates more and more solution sets for more and more optionality. In creating a great team, for instance, you need to be good with people hating you. You need to be good with drawing boundaries and having people upset. You need to be able to have high expectations. You have to be okay with somebody being disappointed with themselves. You have to be okay being disappointed with yourself. All these emotional experiences have to be available to you if you're going to find the solutions to make an A quality team. The more you can fall in love with each emotional experience, the more you have and then the clearer the decision making gets. That's one thing for making great decisions. The other one that I find really, really useful and very hard to execute on until you really understand it is creating a set of principles to live by.

(00:58:06):
We all have a set of principles to live by that we're doing it. For a lot of people, those principles are what do I have to do to get likes on Facebook? I'm going to make a decision based on getting likes on Facebook. I'm going to make decisions based on whatever it is. Pretending that I want to get wealthy or trying to get wealthy or there's a series of things. If you really take a look at what it is you're making your decisions on and then really think about, well, what would be the five or six things that if I made decisions with these principles, I'm guaranteed success? Then experiment with them and then refine those principles and then experiment with them. Then there'll be these moments where you don't want to do it, but those are your principles, so you're going to go and do it.

(00:59:03):
As an example for this, one of the principles that I live by is embrace intensity. It's not create intensity, it's embrace intensity. It means that right now, any moment in my body, for instance, there's going to be a sensation that's more intense. How do I welcome that sensation? At any moment in running my business, there's going to be something that we don't want to talk about. How do we lean in and talk about that? We start all of our meetings with what are you scared to say in our business? What are you scared to say? Not all of our meetings, but some of our meetings are started with what are you scared to say? Because we want to embrace that intensity because we know that if we lean into the thing that we're trying to avoid, our life is going to get better, our business is going to get better.

(00:59:57):
If you can see what those principles are for you, and then run experiments to see if they work and then refine them every once in a while. Because of that embrace intensity, if somebody comes to me and says, "You're fucking up this business. You're doing it all wrong." I don't have to think about what I'm going to do. I'm like, "Oh, cool. Tell me what I'm missing." It's going to be immediate because I live this way. Maybe I don't want to hear it. Maybe I'm having a bad day. Whatever it is. Maybe I'll say, "Hey, I want hear you give me, I'm not able to, give me a day and I'll come back to you." all of a sudden, my decisions get made automatically if I live by a set of principles and very effective, I find very effective living by a set of principles

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:51):
For someone that wants to create their own set of principles. Is there a guide you have? Is there any advice for how to actually go about starting this list, putting it together?

Joe Hudson (01:00:58):
We have a decisions course, which is a large part of it is about how to do that. It's a difficult one to explain because there's a lot of nuance in it. Just as for instance, one of the nuances is defining the principles, not just by what it is, but what it isn't is a really significant, very minor thing, but it ends up being incredibly major. If you're going to do your set of principles and you want to do them on your own, the main thing I would say is keep it to five. I wouldn't even do six. I don't do six, but I keep it to five. I would test each one of them for five days.

(01:01:39):
Make your principle and then see if it works for you for five days and then keep on experimenting until you find five. When you look at those five and you say, "If I do that, if I live by those principles, I am just almost a hundred, if not a hundred percent confident that, that's going to create the life I want if I live by those principles." Then you have a really good start and make them simple. Mine are things like embrace intensity or connection first or everything is in iteration. As soon as I live by them, things work, company works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:20):
Amazing. We'll point folks to that course if they want to take it themselves. Cool.

Joe Hudson (01:02:25):
It's only once a year, so it's a rare one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):
Oh, wow. When is the next one?

Joe Hudson (01:02:29):
January.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):
Okay. Not too far away for folks to want to wait. Again, the two pieces of advice you shared, and that's our experiments that we can run to help become better decision makers. One is create a list of life principles, and there's a course that will point people to, to take that. The other is the thing you keep coming back to over and over and over, this idea of falling in love with your emotions, embracing your emotions, welcoming your emotions. There's also, I know you do a lot of work with teams. I imagine there's very similar advice for how to help your team be more effective. Principles, I imagine is a part of it, falling in love.

Joe Hudson (01:03:02):
We've run principles for teams, yeah. That's one of them. Teams would be more effective. We have a lot of, I mean I think I have, at this point, I have 12 things that I'll go into a company and do with a company. Typically, the way I like to do it is I will go in and I'll talk to the leader typically and they'll say, "This is what I want." Then I really want to assess. Typically, if the person who is a big part of creating the problem has a hard time seeing the way through the problem, or it wouldn't have been created generally. This is not demeaning any leader, we all have these issues. Usually, what I like to do is I like to go in and I like to talk to three or four people, see what their perspective, not just the leader's perspective.

(01:03:57):
Then I like to sit in a meeting or two and just see actually what the dynamic is. One of the things I like to say about how to change a company is that the atomic structure of a company is the meetings and the decisions. It's particularly true in Silicon Valley, but it's really true in all businesses that all we are as a company is a group of people's relationships and ideas. Especially, like Amazon, you got a couple of buildings and some servers. There's not a lot of hardware there, and they wouldn't be useful without the people anyways. Anybody, whether you're running a farm or a shoe factory or anybody's successful is going to tell you it's all about the people. The atomic structure is what are our meetings like and how do we make decisions? I'll just really pay attention to a meeting. One of the things we do is we talk about what we call five-star meetings, which is how do you make every meeting enjoyable?

(01:05:04):
Literally, how is it that everybody when they walk out of a meeting, they're like, oh, fuck, that was great? It turns out, we've all been in meetings that are hard as shit, and we've walked out and gone, oh, those are great meetings. We've all been in meetings where nothing happens and we're like, "Oh, God. Fuck, another one to just drive a nail through my head. I don't want to sit there." What's required to make one of your meetings five stars? If you do that, that's one of the things we'll do inside of a company is work with them to figure that out. If you do that, every single problem with your company will come to the surface. Every single one of them. I had ten five -tar meetings, but these two meetings sucked. That tells me exactly where we need to focus as a company.

(01:05:53):
That tells me exactly where to look for the problem that's happening. It's the same thing with decisions. If you really start unpacking how the decisions are made where people are frustrated in the decision-making process, you're going to find exactly the problems in the company. An example of this, I was working with a friend and he's a content person, and we were just talking about how do you make every one of your meetings a five-star meeting? He's like, "Okay, great." He's like, "Yeah, I'm never going to do this." I was like, "Really? Tell me why." He's, "My YouTube meetings fucking suck." That's not where he makes most of his money, but these YouTube meetings suck. They're never going to get better.

(01:06:39):
Luckily, there's a couple other people around at the time and everyone's like, "No, wait, I love my YouTube meetings. What do you mean? How could this not work for you?" He noticed, oh, the team didn't, the content, none of it was working for him. None of it was him. He was just like, "Ugh." He changed it. He was like, "Okay, I'm going to commit to that. I'm going to see what it's like for me to just say every one of my YouTube meetings have to be something that's super enjoyable to me." When he did it, his YouTube numbers went off the charts in a very short period of time. It's just that common. Wherever the meeting is that sucks, it means there's something else that's a problem that needs to be worked on. That's typically how. I can just look at, usually sit in any team meeting and see at least three or four of the major problems that are happening in the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):
Such a cool way of thinking about where to focus decision-making meetings. I love that the story comes back to something you shared earlier with the more you enjoy something, the more joy there is, the better it's going to go anyway. The more you can find those moments and make things enjoyable, the better.

Joe Hudson (01:07:45):
The other cool thing is most of the executives or the CEOs that I've worked with, when they get to a point, and it usually takes them like, we always have the goal of a month, it usually takes two months to make sure every one of their meetings is five-star meetings. Once they've done that, then it's like, how do you make sure all of your teams have five-star meetings? Usually, it's like within two months and they usually have half the amount of meetings at the end of it. Half the amount of meetings in their companies are more effective. It's an incredible tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
I could see why people enjoy that if you were meeting as well. Is there anything more along those lines before we start to close out our conversation, either around teams or decision-making?

Joe Hudson (01:08:30):
I'll say for anybody who's running a team, Harvard has got a couple of these, but we used to do these tiny pulses. As a VC, one of the strategies that was really effective that I saw very few VCs doing was I would want these pulse, I would like to read the pulse of teams with these short surveys and stuff. It was the most effective way of not very happy, didn't want to come to work on Monday. They weren't going to make their numbers. The likelihood of them making their numbers is going down. There was this interesting thing that just about how Drucker, I think said it first and then the Virgin guy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
Branson?

Joe Hudson (01:09:16):
Branson said it. He's like, "Culture eats strategy for breakfast," or some such. If that's true, then it's measurable and it can be a leading indicator, and it absolutely is. If you really pay attention to the culture on a team-by-team basis, it's an amazing, very effective way to drive results, but also, a very effective way to know when bad results are coming. What's interesting to me is most people feel like they can't control the culture, like most people feel like.

(01:09:52):
Most people, I notice, they feel like, it's more likely for me to hear from a CEO, "God damn it, everybody agrees when I get out of the table. When I get off the table, everyone's like, yeah, we're going to do it. Then they don't do it. Why aren't they doing it?" I'm going to hear that more often than I'm going to hear a CEO say, "Oh, wow. I really noticed that the way the email system was working in our company, we were disempowering people by not requiring an action after every..." I'm going to hear more complaints about why shit isn't working than I'm going to hear about strategies, like very gentle, simple strategies to change the culture. it's an amazing thing to me that it's so powerful and yet people feel so out of control with it

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
To give people something they can do, say today or tomorrow to work on a lot of these things we've been talking about. Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone should try to experiment with in the next day, couple of days or weeks, just to help them be better and more successful and happier?

Joe Hudson (01:11:00):
I would do seven minutes, no less than seven minutes. You can do more than seven minutes. Seven minutes of gratitude with another person every day. It can't be, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this. It has to be feeling the gratitude and then seeing what comes out of your mouth when you're coming from the felt sense of gratitude and doing it back and forth. You're savoring the experience of gratitude and you're going back and forth with another human being. Call mom, dad, sister, brother, business partner, friend, and every day just express gratitude back and forth for seven minutes, coming from the feeling, not from the thought. If you have a full body sensation of gratitude and you experience that for seven minutes a day, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly. Really, really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):
Wow. I already feel it. The practice is you are expressing gratitude to the person you're with.

Joe Hudson (01:12:09):
It can be gratitude for anything in your life. As a matter of fact, I would say do it for a couple of weeks and then do it on the places where you feel lack. That's where the superpower comes in. In my own personal life, I was meditating. I spent seven, eight hours a day meditating for years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):
That's a lot of hours.

Joe Hudson (01:12:32):
You can imagine, I didn't have a lot of money. The joke I used to make is I would meditate and worry about money most of my day. It's funny, but it's truth. One day, I was thinking about money and thinking I was driving in my car and I was thinking about this billionaire I knew and I was thinking about how I didn't have enough and then I thought, "Oh, this billionaire doesn't think they have enough either. I know I'm well enough." I'm like, "Oh, I have the experience of a billionaire right now." I was like, "He's probably driving in a car somewhere thinking he doesn't have enough, and I'm driving in a car somewhere thinking I don't have enough. This is great. I'm a billionaire."

(01:13:20):
It tickled me, the idea tickled me. Then I was like, well, what happens if I start focusing on everything I do have instead of focusing on what I don't have? Which is where the gratitude practice came from. My wife and I would sit every day and just be grateful for all the physical stuff that we had. We were living in a hobble, were living 15-year-old year cars. We had no money. I was in debt. I was in, I think $40,000 in credit card debt or some crazy shit. We just did it. Literally, was it three months later, my credit card debt was gone. Six months later, I had $60,000 in the bank. Entire life changed because I no longer defined myself by somebody who didn't have, I defined myself as somebody who did have. All of a sudden, I could look out the window and it wasn't, "Oh, shit, I can't have that. I can't have that. I can't have that."

(01:14:18):
I look out the window, I'd say somebody made money on that. Somebody made money on that. Every fucking thing I looked at, somebody made money on. 20 people, 20 companies made money on the fucking lamppost. The person who installed it, the energy company, the rubber company, there's just, holy crap, it's all over the place. Then in that definition, all of a sudden, it became really clear. It doesn't matter if the thing that you feel like you lack is time, or the thing that you feel like you lack is love or the thing that you feel like you lack is money. If you can really do a gratitude practice on the thing that you lack, there's a superpower in that one, changes everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
Do you still do this?

Joe Hudson (01:15:00):
I do gratitude, yes. Do I do gratitude on stuff I lack? I don't really have an experience of lack. That's not really...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:07):
You still do this gratitude, seven minutes?

Joe Hudson (01:15:09):
Of course, yes. That's like asking if I still have sex. Why would I give that up? It feels great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:16):
Just to be clear, you find someone seven minutes every morning, probably think about things you're grateful for and share back. Focus not on your intellectual thing you're grateful for, but just what's coming out of your emotional body.

Joe Hudson (01:15:28):
Feel the gratitude.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:30):
Yeah, then gratitude.

Joe Hudson (01:15:30):
Let the feeling of gratitude speak rather than your mind, so that you get the felt sense of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Joe, I'm incredibly grateful for you. I really appreciate you sharing so many experiments for people to run. I think this is going to make a real impact on a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find your courses? I know you have a podcast. Where can folks find the stuff they do online, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:15:55):
First of all, Art of Accomplishment, the podcast, it's Art of Accomplishment with Brett Kistler and Joe Hudson, I think. Then Art of Accomplishment, the website will show you where all the courses are. It'll give you a whole bunch of experiments you can run. There's all sorts of really great information there. The other thing that we just mentioned also is just that we really want to make sure that you think that the courses are for you. The way we do courses is that it's a very felt experience thing. It's not intellectual at all. It's really in your body. The way we like doing it is that you bring real problems that you're having and you use the tools that we teach you. The foundational course for that is called the Connection Course. If you want to get into it, go to the Connection Course.

(01:16:45):
To find out if it's right for you, if you're not already know that it's right for you, we do these little hour and a half free workshops and it'll give you a taste of what it is that we do because it's like anything that's going on out there. It's people doing, they're like, "What the hell was that?" It's just a completely different thing. It's not like learning in the normal way. You literally sit down with another person and run experiments face-to-face with how you're being in the moment. You learn all this stuff through direct experimentation. If you find out it's right for you, you can do it through these workshops, and I'm sure there'll be a place where they can find out where to go for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
There's one coming up in September, I believe.

Joe Hudson (01:17:30):
The Connection Course is coming up in September. It's a great place to start. It's foundational for everything else we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):
Then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:17:39):
I want my children to grow up in a fantastic world. The best way that, that can happen is that if the people listening to this discover who they are and their nature and the truth of how they operate. Not for them, but for their children and their children's children. You want to do me a favor and make my daughter's world a better place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:08):
I also just had a son, and so I totally resonate with that.

Joe Hudson (01:18:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:13):
Joe, thank you so much for being here. What an amazing podcast episode. This ended up being as I expected.

Joe Hudson (01:18:19):
Pleasure. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it, Lenny.

# Conscious leadership: Unlocking vision, strategy and purpose | JM Nickels (Uber, Waymo, DoorDash)

## Transcript

John Mark Nickels (00:00:00):
Get clear on your objective function, and one way that I've gotten clear on it is trying to think about it from future me because five years from now, I'm not going to give a if I made the presentation slightly better, but I'm going to care a lot about what kind of relationship I have with my daughters, and that means that the next action, the next thing I do today and tomorrow, those will translate into the relationship with her, right? Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. We try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed, right? We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work and go on vacation and do what we do. To me, an awareness and mindfulness that our lives will come to an end punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Today my guest is J.M. Nickels. J.M. has been a product leader at Waymo, DoorDash and Uber. He's also an engineering manager at Groupon, and before that an equity trader at Getco. At Uber, he built and launched the very first version of Uber Pool and then went on to lead the team responsible for the infrastructure and algorithms powering the economic and logistics brain behind Uber's matching and pricing systems. At DoorDash, he was head of product for DoorDash platform. At Waymo, he led product for the commercialization of autonomous ride hailing and last mile delivery. And he recently returned to Uber to lead product for the mobility team.

(00:01:30):
This conversation is a unique and beautiful mixture of hard skills, soft skills, tactics, and emotions. I won't give away too much about the conversation, but this is a powerful one. Tears are shed, stories are shared, and I'm confident you'll become a better leader and human having listened to J.M.'s insights and lessons. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you J.M. Nickels.

(00:02:05):
J.M., thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

John Mark Nickels (00:02:08):
Thank you, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm thrilled to be here. Really appreciate your dedication to helping product managers improve their craft and up-level. We've done a lot of great researches out there for that, and coaching and development, as I'm sure we'll get into, is a passion of mine as well, so we have a lot of shared interests there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:26):
Oh, I really appreciate that. I want to start with a phrase that came up again and again when I ask people what to talk to you about from your colleagues, and this phrase is conscious leadership. What is conscious leadership? What does this phrase mean?

John Mark Nickels (00:02:42):
To me, leadership is broadly defined as having influence in the world, and so by that definition, to me, everyone is a leader because we all have influence in some way. It's not about whether you're a manager or not, it's like I have influence on my kids or my partner or my community, or the world, the way I vote, the way I show up. So we all have influence. We're all co-creating influences of each other. So that's the leadership piece. The conscious piece then is becoming more aware, waking up. To me, it's like learning more about my interior world, what my background is, my biases. We all inherit certain belief systems from our parents or our church or our community, and a lot of times they kind of go unquestioned and then they end up in conflict. And so it's really just about becoming more aware and then taking responsibility for the influence that I have. So yeah, taking responsibility for my influence in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:42):
As you talk about this, something that came up and something that I thought about as I was preparing for this episode is this idea of soft leadership, the power of soft skills and just how important that is in success. Is there something there that comes up when I say that? Just the power of soft skills and the importance of those in being successful.

John Mark Nickels (00:03:59):
Yeah, it's, what was it? Theodore Roosevelt, speak softly and carry a big stick? Yeah, I think I've evolved in that department. I think when I was younger in my career, I thought it was really important that we got to show up to the meeting and have the right slides and be the loudest, rightest voice in the room, and that's the way to have influence. And there's certainly a place for having leadership in a meeting and presenting a point of view and helping guide the narrative, but to me, yeah, I would say I've evolved more towards sitting back. It's also as I've become a more senior leader, I'm aware that there are power dynamics there. There's imbalances where junior folks don't feel as comfortable speaking up or I say something's not a good idea and then, "Well, I don't want to disagree with J.M."

(00:04:45):
So it's like, back to being more aware of my influence in the world. I really try to spend more time being mindful of that and say, I want to hear from other people first. I want to create space and I don't need to win the argument in the meeting. There can be a follow-up. It's not like this is my last chance to say something, but that's also more true when you're more senior because when you're more junior, it's like, well, this is the one presentation I have with Dara for the next six months. I really got to nail it. And so the pressure is a little bit different. Yeah.

(00:07:35):
There's a couple of threads I want to follow here, but first, I was thinking as you're talking, when people think Uber and people that work at Uber, I don't think they imagine people like you. And I know you were there early and then you joined again. Was that ever like a, "Is this a place for me?" Did you ever go through that struggle or is it just, yeah, I don't know?

John Mark Nickels (00:07:55):
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I would say I have been fortunate to experience probably three Ubers at this point. We joke about Uber 1.0, the Travis era, and you hear a lot about in the media the kind of bad parts of that, but there were some really good parts too. I mean, I think there was a lot of... Like when I joined in 2014, there was this mission of making transportation as reliable as running water for anyone anywhere, which is bold, audacious, and maybe a little bit pretentious from a little bit of Silicon Valley edge, but you could feel the electricity in the air. There was this energy and excitement like we're doing something transformational, autonomy is coming, car ownership will change. And it just like, feel, like my vibration.

(00:08:37):
And then, yeah, the good parts of that era were, Travis was a very great visionary product leader, and we started ATG and Elevate and these future-forward things and the way he would conduct product reviews, I learned a lot. It was stressful at the time, but looking back, I was like, wow, I learned a lot. But yeah, I would say it was not a very conscious leadership sort of place. You're right, it was like many organizations that run on fear because you can do that, carrots and sticks do work. But actually that's kind of how I found this work is it was in 2015 and I was a very junior product manager at that point, in over my head in a fast-growing place. And in these weekly reviews with Travis as we were building out Uber Pool, and I had a six-month-old daughter, my firstborn, and we had just moved to San Francisco from Chicago. So my whole life was in flux and it was a very stressful place, and I was like, "I think I'm going to snap. I don't think I can handle this."

(00:09:31):
And that's kind of what led me to start to explore this sort of inner work and meditation and sort of finding a way out of that. And that's what got me interested in bringing it to teams too, is because I remember I was in one meeting where we were working on this future pricing thing, which is rider pricing, driver pricing, incentives, and how we bring surge pricing and all that together. And it gets very, I'll go heavy, and we have all these PhDs in the room, some of the best minds in the world. We were able to hire people like Garrett van Ryzin, who was the foremost [inaudible 00:10:04] more person from Columbia and other people.

(00:10:06):
But everyone's back to lizard brain, everyone's arguing. They're like, "Well, no, I think we should do it this way. We should do it this way." And I was like, huh. As much as I enjoy the content of this, believe me, I'm an algo PM end to end, I love that stuff. But I was like, I don't think this conversation actually needs another PhD, or I'm not even PhD, but content expert. It's like what we need here is a way to shift again, back out of that fear, threat, righteousness sort of state into a more co-creative, collaborative, open-minded, curious, trusting sort of space. And that got me interested in pursuing more skills in coaching of individuals and teams.

(00:10:49):
But yeah, to your Uber question, yeah, the Uber 1.0 was crazy. Uber 2.0 was kind of like, Travis is out, the board is feuding, is leaking to Mike Isaac, whatever. And then Dara comes in and the peacemaker and then tries to stabilize, but the IPO is rocky. And so now I would say we're in Uber 3.0, which it's full pirate ship to navy, in Reid Hoffman's words, a profitable company. We're printing free cashflow, we're in the S&P 500, we've established the independent contractor model in a lot of states and jurisdictions, and it's like there's less risk of that model changing.

(00:11:28):
And yeah, I would say we're in an era now of Cambrian explosion of different types of transportation. The company really just built the UberX model and scaled it out to the world. That's primarily how we got here. And now it's like we're going out for all these different new sort of modalities, whether it's reserving a ride in advance or shared rides or renting a car or buses, and then different supply types too. It's not just contracted, we have a lot of fleets in the platform, we now have a lot of taxi drivers in the platform. You've seen we've signed deals with Waymo and Cruise and other autonomist players. So I feel like we're now at the beginning of another era of Uber and transportation, that the next decade or two, it's going to be super exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):
One quick tangent, UberX, a previous guest shared that the name UberX came from... it was just like the internal code name, UberX, we'll figure out a real name later, and then it stuck and no one had a better name. Is that true?

John Mark Nickels (00:12:23):
Yeah, that's right. I think that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
Amazing.

John Mark Nickels (00:12:26):
When I joined, we were already scaling UberX rapidly. I joined in early 2014. That's amazing. But I did help name Uber Pool, Uber Pool, which I selflessly like to bring back. It got renamed to Share during my external APM rotation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:42):
Okay. I want to come back to the thread that I pushed us off of, which is you talked about, you made this really interesting point about emotions, and this is something I've been learning myself recently with having a kid and also a couple of previous guests. So you say that when you have... so you're in this meeting, you're stressed, there's a lizard brain kicking in. Something's like, "Oh, Dara's going to think I suck and it's going to really screw my career if I mess up this presentation." Your advice there is very counterintuitive, I think for a lot of people, which is accept that emotion. Because when I feel stressed and nervous in a meeting, I'm not, "Embrace the nervousness, let it out." It's more I'm just like, "No, it's fine. Going to be okay. Don't worry about it." Talk about why that is actually more effective.

John Mark Nickels (00:13:28):
Yeah, yeah. It's like my daughter the other day had some nightmares and she was like, "Dad, how do I stop thinking thoughts about the nightmare or whatever?" And I said, "You can't. Don't try to stop the thought. Just allow it. Let me show you why that doesn't work." I said, "Don't think of a pink elephant. What did you just think of?" And she's like, "A pink elephant." And then now she thinks it's hilarious and she tells her sister, "Don't think of a pink elephant."

(00:13:55):
But yeah, I think you're right. It is a little counterintuitive, but one of my first coaches actually had a great phrase, what you resist will persist and what you fear will appear. And so in my experience, this is another reason why becoming more aware of my internal world has been so important. I have more agency than I realized on the outcome of my experience. And so when I think a thought like, Dara might think I suck and then I have a thought that I suck, that can become a self-enforcing negative feedback loop where I have a thought that creates stress, anxiety, fear, and then that triggers more thoughts and we call it cognitive emotive loop where you're kind of in this cycle of thinking stressful thoughts and then having unpleasant, anxious, fearful feelings. And so one way to break that is to just allow it and not try to fight it with other thoughts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
So the advice is very tactically, so you're in a meeting with Dara, you're stressed about something. Just allow it, let it be. Don't try to pretend like it's not there or don't try to convince yourself-

John Mark Nickels (00:15:00):
Well, that would be the first step, is just to allow whatever's here, thoughts and emotions are rising. They come, they go, they're transient. It's not permanent. There's a lot of wisdom I think in the Buddhist lineage around those concepts. And then the next piece for me, once I can take a breath and relax a little bit, is coming home to the fact that I... and this is a little more radical for some people, I don't actually need Dara to approve of me in my presentation in order to be okay. What I'm up to over here is trying to force self-worth and self-love from within. And so we talk about approval, control and security. It's very easy to look for that from the world. Do you approve of me? And if not, can I control outcomes to get approval or get security and get the job, the bank account, the house, whatever it is?

(00:15:52):
But what I kind of woke up to at one point was that as long as I was going out there looking for all that stuff to try to complete something inside of me that was missing, it's like I was a hungry ghost. It's like, it doesn't matter how many Michelin star meals and promotions and money and title and whatever. It's like it's never enough. It's like you kind of enjoy it for a little bit and then you get back to like, hm, you know? So it's like a never ending sugar addiction. And so that's the next step for me is allow it. Yes, allow the emotion, allow the thought. Come home to, "I am okay even Dara does think I suck." And then also it's not permanent, right? It's like sure, there might be some high stakes things in life where you only get one shot, but for the most part it's like if I didn't do a great job on this presentation, there'll be another one. It's okay.

(00:16:45):
And think of it as practice. The other thing is from the fear threat state, I'm like, uh-oh, this is a risk, alarm bells, my career could be over. Whereas if I'm in that trusting, curious, open space, it's like this is an opportunity for feedback. How can I learn? How can I get to become a better presenter? It's like the feedback from others is no longer a threat. It's actually a gift. It's like information that I can use or not use to alter how I show up in the future and the skills I develop and all that good stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:21):
I imagine some people may hear this and feel like if Dara or Travis or whoever thinks I suck, my career is at stake and that really matters and everything's going to fall apart in my life because I get fired, there's stakes involved with messing up. Is there anything that helps you get past that and not worry so much about just this trickle effect of all the things that could go wrong if you mess something up in an important high stakes meeting or presentation?

John Mark Nickels (00:17:46):
Yeah. Again, and maybe it is a little paradoxical, but what I found was the more I focused on how I show up and optics and having a good deck and all this, the less I got promoted and then the more I dropped focusing all that. Because for my first few years of Uber, I was a senior PM and then I finally got my groove and started kind of moving through the product ladder. And it was really correlated to me at least, maybe causal, with dropping a lot of the focus on the presentation and how I show up and whether people like this or not, and just really focusing on the work. It's like, you know what? I am here to be a conduit from what wants to happen in the world of transportation and mobility and shared rides is one that I've always been particularly passionate about, so that's a good example, and then how can I get present and listen to what wants to happen next in the world of shared rides? And there's lots of different ways we can take the product and all that.

(00:18:45):
And it's really about, I want to make a fucking awesome product, right? And it's like, whether people like me or think I'm a good PM or presenter, as long as I manifest a great product into the world that makes riders better off, drivers better off, cities better off, less congestion, all these things, that to me is the reward. And sure, in order to manifest that, it is often helpful to communicate things, present, align, all those sort of things. But those are a means to a more powerful and transformative end than just my career. I'm tapping into a larger purpose and sense of belonging and identity and sort of meaning. And from that place, it's like I've just dropped the kind of egoic, self-centered focus on whether I did good in the presentation or not. And then yeah, maybe paradoxically, by doing that, it actually goes better and we do great work and it gets recognized.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
Wow, that is fascinating. To make that work, you need to really connect with the mission of the company you're working at. You really need to believe this is very important and very meaningful. So maybe that could be an issue for people if they don't really care about what the company's doing, it's going to be hard to allow for that approach.

John Mark Nickels (00:19:58):
Totally, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:00):
It's interesting that you say that optics aren't as important. I think the reason I think about this as you talk about, a lot of people feel like there's the work and then there's talking about the work, making the work, the optics of what you did is really, really important. And I love to hear. Nobody wants to do that, but they always get this advice. So important, optics, how you share the impact you've done, how you represent yourself. I guess, is there anything else you can share there about just helping people relax about that aspect of their job and without being so critical?

John Mark Nickels (00:20:31):
Yeah. And to be clear, I do think it's important. It can't be all work and no optics or all optics and no work. There does need to be a balance there, and I think it does change depending on the size of the company and the level of seniority. When you're an IC, you're probably hopefully doing more actual work, and leaders are supporting them and presenting and communicating that work so that they get.

(00:20:56):
I mean, the optics does matter, right? At some senior level, you do spend more time on that, and it does have influence, back to the influence piece, which is like, how will I communicate an idea and the need for engineering resourcing and so forth might mean that team gets more engineers or doesn't get more engineers, or we do this project or we don't, right? Because at the end of the day, executive resource allocation is largely based on the, quote-unquote, "optics layer". So it does matter. I want to be clear. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, but to me, again, it's more about that's a means to an end. It's not about the optics itself. It's like say what the Buddha is saying, don't mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon. And the finger pointing at the moon could be the presentation, the OKR, you know, whatever. And it's like, that's not the actual outcome we care about. That's an input to the output that really matters, which is the work, the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:47):
Okay. I'm going to shift this to hard skills and another kind of direction. So another thing that came up a bunch when I was asking people what you're amazing at and what you're really good at is strategy and vision. I had this quote from one of your colleagues, Brent Goldman, "J.M. thinks big, has lots of great ideas, will 'yes, and' to other people's ideas, will inspire everyone around him to be more creative, ambitious, and hardworking. He doesn't climb hills, he finds bigger mountains and will bring you there." So along these lines, say someone comes to you and wants to build these skills, wants to get better at strategy, wants to get better at vision, which is something basically every product leader is trying to get better at and every leader wants to get better at, what advice do you generally share? How does one improve in these areas?

John Mark Nickels (00:22:35):
Yeah, thank you. I appreciate the compliment. Thank you, Brent. That is a great quote. Wow. Yeah, I mean there's no magic toolkit or manual. I've long ago given up on the notion that I'm one book away from the perfect elusive answer to whatever plagues you in life. And there's obviously lots of books about strategy and you get into all that. I guess for me, a couple of things have been helpful. One is you mentioned earlier finding a mission that you're really passionate about. I think it would be hard for me to come up with a strategy for improving the healthcare system. It's like, sure, it's important. I hope someone does it and figures out how to deal with HIPAA and whatever, all this stuff, but it's just not for me. It's not my purpose, mission and vision in life.

(00:23:24):
And so step one is, am I working at a place and in a product area in which I have a tremendous amount of passion? Because for me, that is the fuel and the motivation that helps me break through to getting the strategy. That's the first step. So that's where I feel enormously lucky because again, this revolutionizing transportation and car ownership and what happens with autonomy and form factors and future of cities is something that I'm super excited about. I think about my daughters growing up and having a different world to live in that's safer and more environmentally friendly, all this stuff, and I get really jazzed when I think about, wow, the work I do could actually impact their future lives and other people. It's like, whoa, I can feel the chills right now. It's just super motivating. So that's the first place, just getting myself fired up.

(00:24:10):
And then the next thing I guess that's been helpful is I've deeply immersed myself. I haven't really jumped around between crypto and gen AI, this stuff, and a lot of people do that. It's great, nothing wrong with that, but I've been in this largely focused on mobility space for 10 years now with some stints over in the restaurant tech and delivery side, but very related in terms of last mile logistics. And so I think it's hard to come up with a great strategy if you've only been working in an area for six months. Especially things like this, they're super nuanced. Shared rides is another a good example where it's a super hard problem to crack and it's going deep on that for a long time is a precursor to being successful.

(00:24:55):
The other thing I would say though is people always talk about first principles thinking, but if there's truth in it, I think that's like when Elon's like, "Well, why does the rocket cost a gazillion dollars to launch? And there's no reason they have to throw away the materials and blah, blah, blah." One example might be, why do we need a 4,000 pound vehicle to move a human three miles? Okay, well... Or even a couple of humans. We do an Uber Pool or a Share, and you move two humans or three humans, even then that's pretty inefficient. If you think about just the physics there, the energy expenditure.

(00:25:32):
And that's where I think you might come up with bikes and scooters and little other things. And sure it's not always, it's raining or you want the car, but that's sort of an example of why questioning why are things the way they are, and then is the way they are super inefficient or not optimal in some sense? And that is often a doorway to opportunity to see, okay, well maybe things could be different. And so I kind of extend that at a larger level to the future. My general thing is just like, yeah, that's the mountain thing is I try to just close my eyes and imagine the future as far out as I can.

(00:26:09):
It's like five years from now, 10 years from now, whatever. And it's develop a really salient picture of what that looks like. It's like, we could do this right now, it's okay. 10 years from now, what could San Francisco look like? Or some city? What happens to the parking spaces? Are there still parking garages? Are those parks now? What are the modes of transport? Are there bus-like things that are autonomous that are connecting people to bikes and scooters? And how are people living? Do they live in the far suburbs even more because autonomy and they have a nicer house and they come in, or is all the space repurposed and actually it's cheaper to live in the city because we compact things, blah, blah, blah. It's not even about having the right one, it's more just developing some sort of picture of the future that gets you fired up.

(00:26:57):
And then yeah, you got to go articulate that and communicate it and get people to come on the journey with you. But from that picture, it's like, well, first principle, what's going to be true 10, 20 years from now? Well, autonomy is a given. I think most people would probably agree with that, and we'll probably solve it with just cameras and won't need lidar because humans don't have lidar. The cost of vehicles and sensors will come down, remote support will come down, and at some point it'll be super cheap and it's like, okay, I can extrapolate, that will be a thing. Separate from which player wins. I'm not saying I can predict the ecosystem of companies that will win here. It's more about just the underlying dynamics. And then that would be one, and another one would be sharing. It's like, well, a lot of people are like, "Oh, well, once we have cheap autonomous cars, everyone can just have their own super cheap Uber, Tesla or whatever it is here in the city."

(00:27:45):
And you're like, "Well, that doesn't work because then we're going to hit this induced demand concept," which is what economists call it, and you used to, when text messages cost 50 cents a piece, how many did you send versus now when it's free, it's in the millions. Same thing when they add a lane to a highway, the traffic just gets just as bad as before because more people drive and so forth. So if we flood the streets with super cheap autonomous cars with single occupancy, we're just going to have even more good luck than we do right now. Maybe we'll do The Boring Company thing and dig tunnels, but that seems unlikely.

(00:28:16):
So then for me, it's like, well, from first principles, shared rides is going to continue to be an important part of the future of transportation. And other modalities where yeah, back to the three mile thing, it's like, well, there probably will be various form factors of bikes, scooters and little mini golf cart things and whatever we end up building. And so that's hopefully an example of how I try to think about what are the likely things to be true in the future, and then how does that lead to a potential ecosystem and strategy around what we might build towards that future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
This is great because this is something everyone can do, and there's all this talk of creating a vision, painting a vision, communicating a vision, and what you're describing is how to actually sit there and think about what it might look like. Sit there, close your eyes and in your head visualize in the next five or 10 years, what does the future actually look like? And do you do this in a state of if we were to do this product and change, or is it just even if we're not around, here's where the future is going to go most likely, which direction do you usually take?

John Mark Nickels (00:29:20):
Yeah, that's a good question. I think you could probably do either. I typically like to start with the former, which is just like, what will the world move towards absent of me? Just trying to pick a bird's-eye view of what I think the trajectories are and trends and what's going to happen. And then yeah, you could apply a lens of, okay, if we were to build product XYZ or have the strategy, how might we influence the outcome or benefit from it, or is it in congruence with that or is it rubbing against that and trying to change that? Either could be good, you might say it's a tailwind or a headwind, both are overcomeable, but having some awareness of the relationship between those things is good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):
And I think transportation, Uber, Waymo, in theory it might be easier to visualize that future and how exciting that might be versus a B2B SaaS payroll app or some photo sharing thing. But on the other hand, not necessarily, right? What in the future in 10 years, how are people going to be paid? How do people work at companies? I think there's an opportunity to do that no matter what you're building. Is this something you actually do? You just sit there in the office, close your eyes and just imagine? Is this more of an iterative process where you get with your team, how do you actually practice this?

John Mark Nickels (00:30:31):
Yeah, it's not like something you can just schedule 30 minutes for in the middle of your day of packed OKR reviews and random one-on-ones and meetings. It's like, I like to do it on my own at first unless it's something that I already have an outline for and I'm ready to move into a team space. So for me, it's like, yeah, can I get into a quiet contemplative space? So yeah, I like to go for a run and that obviously gives me ideas, or I'll go for a hike up in Marin and sometimes I'll just think of stuff or jot something down or make a voice note while I'm doing that to get things going. But yeah, the first step for me is just getting out of the craziness of day-to-day. To me, it's still insane how many product manager, leaders of all kinds just run the schedule of back to back meetings, 30-minute review, big meaty topics, you run out of time, run to the next thing, answer a bunch of emails, and then cram some PRDs in there. It's like, it doesn't work.

(00:31:27):
And so I'm a big fan of carving out time, again, first for myself, a couple hours, whatever, where I can just get out of the day-to-day craziness and get into that head space of five, 10 years from now. It's just a different place. So you need to transition to that. And then bring that to teams. If I have an outline of that kind of future of transportation in my head, I might share that with a group of folks and we'll come together also for some extended period of time. We recently had an all-day Monday thing where eight of us came into the office to talk about future of marketplace, and it was super productive. It was like, laptops down, we're going to spend all day together on a whiteboard. It's like a lost art. People don't use the whiteboards anymore.

(00:32:10):
But yeah, and then from there it's getting more people and then you can kind of iterate on it. It's like I had some vision of the future and someone points out something that is a little bit off with it or has a better idea. Then you move into co-creation. But I love that. It's like Pixar calls the brain trust. If you read [inaudible 00:32:28] book, how they come up with a Toy Story and Inside Out and all these things, is they have this group of people that just sits around riffing on ideas. And again, there's no judgment, there's no attachment to being right. They're in a co-creative sort of space where they're just like co-exploring and riffing with each other. And I love to be in that space with other PMs and engineers and data scientists.

(00:33:44):
Something I've started to do, which is hard, but I find really valuable is when I'm driving to not play anything on the radio, not listen to any podcasts, and it's so unnatural and it's like, oh, this is hard. I don't want my brain to just go... you don't trust your brain to go to a place that's fun, but it always does. It always ends up being like, oh, that was so interesting just to think of this idea that just came up. So I've been trying to do that, and that's such a simple thing to do. Just don't turn anything on.

John Mark Nickels (00:34:13):
Well, it's not really good for your podcast business to tell people not to listen to podcasts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):
Okay, everyone, we're cutting this. What I find really helpful is playing Lenny's podcast every time I'm out and about.

John Mark Nickels (00:34:25):
No, but there's something to what you said, which is there's always a lot of content out there to pursue, and I've been in that mode where I'm like, yeah, more content, more... But yeah, actually similar to you, spend a lot of time now not listening to anything. Go on a hike where you don't listen to a podcast or music on your commute and see what happens. You might be surprised.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:45):
Yeah. And it always ends up being like, oh, that was cool. And that's where shower ideas come from and all these things. Maybe just to see if there's something here, in this meeting that you have, this ideation brainstorming meeting, is there anything that came out of that that was really surprising or new from a recent experience? Is there anything there of just like, oh wow, we really uncovered this potential wrinkle of the future that we really need to think about differently?

John Mark Nickels (00:35:08):
Well, it wasn't maybe a specific wrinkle, but one of the things that we're thinking a lot about, like I'm fortunate to be involved in trying to help develop and articulate a multi-year three-year product or even overall tech strategy for the mobility business at Uber. And one of the, I guess big ahas for us is as we move away from the, in some ways simpler world of UberX being the predominant product, which is it used to be pretty simple. It's kind of like a taxi meter on the driver's side. There's a time and distance rate that everybody gets, and then on the rider's side it's like, sure, there's some surge pricing based on supply and demand, but it's one product, it's pretty straightforward. And so this future of multi-modality and on the both demand side and the supply side is what makes the marketplace even more complex and challenging to build.

(00:36:00):
And so it was kind of all this around, okay, well now that we have taxis in the platform and we have fleet providers and we're starting to add Waymos and Cruise and other things, we have to have a marketplace that's aware of those different types of supply and which one might be available for what trips and how to think about cost and quality and allocation of trips and all that. And then on the demand side, it's like, yeah, we've got all these different products like shared rides and reserved rides and comfort and X and priority, and it's like how do we think about how to price those relative to each other? How do we think about which one's to show which user? How do you think about the ranking and so forth? And then that all has feedback loops into the pricing and matching itself as well.

(00:36:45):
So the dynamics of the thing, when I think about the future of marketplace, Uber, is like, whoa. And I don't think anyone's ever built that. That's the super cool thing about it. I think we have the best logistics marketplace tech on the planet and we built something that no one else has ever built, relative to digital marketplaces, for example, just different physical world requirements. And then this next arc of what I described of thinking about different types of supply and different kind of demand channels just adds even more complexity to that. But the aha was like, I guess, yeah, we got to think about all that stuff and think about how the supply and demand relate to each other and yeah, it's going to be cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):
It's just an infinitely cited marketplace now. That's wild. One last nugget I wanted to just reinforce that you shared about how to become better at strategy and vision, developing great and interesting and innovative strategy, and vision is going really deep on a topic. So you've been in the space for a long time. There's this idea that Paul Graham talks about, I think, called your top idea or something like that, that when you have... Whatever your top ideas, the more you can just think about that and keep that top of mind as you go about your day and just have one core focus, the more likely it is you're going to come up with new interesting ideas because your brain's going to keep working on it when you're driving around listening to Lenny's podcast. Just kidding, or going on hike.

(00:38:09):
So I think that's a really important point is if you're finding you're not coming up with a great strategy or vision and just having struggles, part of it might just be you're not spending enough time in that space, you're not going deep enough in the problem area. One approach is just spend a decade in that space. Is there anything else just comes up as I say that of just how to do that?

John Mark Nickels (00:38:26):
Yeah. Well there's also, that's at the macro level, maybe spending 10 years in a space, but at the micro level, back to kind of like defrag your day, don't just do the 20, 30 minute meetings on 20 different topics. Sure, sometimes you do that first and you got to do that. You have a large team like I do, obviously reviews across teams. I'm not saying I don't do that on some days, but it's like, yeah, what are my top few things, right? I think, you're right, I think it was Peter [inaudible 00:38:52] or PayPal guys talked about that too, going really deep and having a person or a leader really responsible for one core, deep thing for the company, and that's something they immerse themselves in. And so in the micro, that to me again translates to, yeah, I don't have a to-do list of 20 things. I try to have a to-do list of three of the most important highest leverage things that could have impact broadly across the company and then try this, like you said, let that one top thing marinate and chew on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:22):
I love that. And I recently had a post about all these productivity tricks, and one of the things that I find really helpful is at the beginning of each day and also at the beginning of each week, just write down, here's the one to three things that I need to do and get done. And everything else, I might have this really long list, but here's the three things if I get done, life will be good. I've done a lot. I've accomplished really great, important things.

John Mark Nickels (00:39:42):
Totally. I tried to do the David Allen GTD thing once, the super complicated organization system. It was too much structure for me. I couldn't do it. At the end of the day, what you said is right. There's basically three things that I need to do next, and then there's just some random backlog that I can just scan through periodically and that's it. That gets you most of the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:01):
It's crazy. I read that book 20 years ago at this point, and there's elements that still make things, like I leverage and benefit from. Even if you don't do the whole thing, that book I recommend people read because there's just like, if you pick a couple things from there, your life gets better. The things that have stuck with me, the main one is this waiting for concept of if you're waiting, if you email your designer and like, "Hey, I need you to review this product," just note, "Waiting for Dan to review design." And just having that thread written down and not in your head really helped me.

John Mark Nickels (00:40:36):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):
Yeah. Anyway, I'm not going to go on that tangent.

John Mark Nickels (00:40:41):
Yeah. It's the core concept of like, whatever steps you use. I think the most powerful takeaway from that book for me was if it's in your head, you're screwed because it's like you're trying to keep track of stuff and be creative and come up with the future of transportation and remember to pick up something from the pharmacy. It's a recipe for disaster. This whole idea of empty mind, beginner's mind, well, you have to empty the mind of all the to-dos first. Just get that out of the head.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:04):
Absolutely. I think it was mind like water, that's the one that stuck with me, where nothing you need to remember can be in your head. It needs to be written down somewhere Anyway, let's not go into a whole productivity podcast here.

John Mark Nickels (00:41:15):
Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):
So we talked about vision strategy. So there's classically two problems people have with vision strategy. One is how do I get better at it? The other is just like, I need to actually get shit done. I can't spend all my time thinking about vision. You have a really good take on how to find this balance and you've seen it work well and not well, just vision versus execution. When do I go big vision, how much I spend on vision versus just get shit done, execute, execute, execute? What could you share about just what you've learned about how to find that balance and what you've seen work and not work?

John Mark Nickels (00:41:48):
Yeah, I think you can go too far either direction, right? It's like everything in life is about balancing the polarity between two opposing forces. And so in this one it's like, yeah, you go too hard in division and theory land, I've seen that go off the axle, early Uber where again, back to the future of pricing, it's like we have all the data scientists and PhDs locked in a room for two weeks and there's a beautiful whiteboard diagram. What did it look like? And then it's like, why don't we actually build this thing? And engineers are like, this is like boiling the ocean. And you just get wrapped around the axle of like, well, that sounds really good in theory, but I have no idea how to even start executing on this. So that's probably an example of we tilted a little too far towards the vision theory land.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):
And this was, you're describing the original plan to make a really good surge pricing algorithm?

John Mark Nickels (00:42:39):
Yeah. This was a plan to try to bring together, say how we do driver pricing, time and distance rates, but also we do incentives for drivers where it's like if you drive this many hours a week, you get a bonus. And there's also surge pricing and how to tie all those systems together in a very sophisticated sort of way. This was back in 2017 or something and it winged a little too hard into theory land.

(00:43:03):
And we still have that bias sometimes. We joke about marketplace, especially when we talk about with other teams that are trying to integrate in the marketplace, let's say they add fleets or teams with a big new product. And then marketplace people would be like, "Well, have you thought about this one random problem that could happen two years from now if teams become this much of demand and blah blah blah, whatever." And it's just like we do get wrapped around the axle on that sometimes. But yeah, so the future of pricing is a good example, we winged a little too far into theory land. But you could probably go too far into execution land too. And I'd say DoorDash in my experience would do that sometimes where we used to actually even half joke there, some of us leaders would be like, "It's ready, fire, aim."

(00:43:49):
And it was like, people would be like, "I'm just going to run through a wall. I have no idea if that's the right wall to run through, but at least I know I'm running through a wall." So yeah, I think it's about balance and can you adjust. Again, it's dynamic. I think there's times where you're in a soul searching sort of, "What is our product strategy? We got to pivot." Maybe you're a startup and it's not working and you want to think about... And then it's like, okay, well pull off the gas a little bit, ease up on the execution and let's lean into the strategy vision piece. And there's times where the strategy and vision's pretty baked at least for the next whatever, six months, a year. And it's like, okay, pedal to the metal. Let's just go execute. Let's get it done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:34):
I just went to this Acquired Podcast event at the Chase Center. Zuck was there, and the CEO of Spotify was there too. And there's two quick anecdotes that you remind me of. One is, Zuck talked about how once Facebook and Zuck and the team align on here's where we're going, no matter how many walls appear in front of them, there's going to be a Mark shaped hole in the wall very soon because they're just going to run through and get things done that they need to get done. And I really love that mentality of once we're sure where we're going, we're going to bust through these walls.

John Mark Nickels (00:45:11):
That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):
The other is a really interesting value at Spotify. So Daniel Ek shared this. He said, "At Spotify we have this core value, talk is cheap." And when you hear that you think it's saying talk is not valuable, and it's actually they look at it as a virtue. Talk is cheap, we can talk and it costs us no money, very little money compared to building something. So they actually spent a lot of time at Spotify refining their ideas and discussing until they're really sure something is right. And I guess any reaction to that? Because I thought that was really interesting.

John Mark Nickels (00:45:41):
Yeah, I love that. It's almost a different flavor of, I think the base of saying of he's like, I like a crisp dock and a messy meeting. The whole Amazon thing, if you have the three-page or seven-page narrative, it's written with the clarity of angels singing from on high, at least describing how the problem statement or feature or whatever. And so it's super crisp and organized and well articulated. And then you might have a meeting where you pick it apart and you talk a lot. That's what made me think of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:12):
Yeah. Awesome. Okay, couple more things I want to spend some time on. One is you've worked at a lot of really interesting successful hyper growth companies, DoorDash, Uber, Waymo. You were also in finance for a while. I want to pick on a few of these and just see what's a lesson you took away or what's an experience from that time that might be interesting or helpful to people?

John Mark Nickels (00:46:34):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):
So you talked about DoorDash a bit. What did you take away from your time at DoorDash? What's something you saw there that either is like, wow, that's a really cool thing I want to do in the future, or here's something they weren't amazing at that I learned to try to avoid?

John Mark Nickels (00:46:47):
Yeah, yeah, it's really amazing to get to see different places and pick the best of what you like. And also the other thing is back to like, for me, there's no right or wrong, it's just differences have pros and cons. There's always two sides of the coin. So what's interesting I think about Uber and DoorDash is first back to the mission and the strategy. They started with different DNA, right? So Uber started with it was to utilize blocked cars at the airport that were not doing trips, but it was more about the riders. It was like whatever origin story you believe, Travis and whoever can get a ride in Paris. And so then it was about better than taxi and all this stuff, but it was very rider centric. It was consumer centric in that sense.

(00:47:31):
And so for a long time, I think Uber kind of took that too far. We got to the polarity of drivers are a commodity, blah, blah, blah, and they had to flip that back and start really investing more on the driver's side of the marketplace. But you look at DoorDash and it's like, Tony grew up in his parents' restaurant kitchen and the DoorDash thesis was how can we help small businesses be more successful? And delivery was just the first instantiation of that sort of meta purpose of DoorDash. And so they're much more merchant centric as opposed to consumer centric. And by the way, the consumer centricism of Uber that started with rides than translated to Eats. I think when Uber started with Eats, it was like, "Well, we just want Lenny to have some great Thai food and sushi and have some options. But selection is a means to Lenny having a great eater experience." Whereas DoorDash with their merchant focus is like, "We want every Thai restaurant in this city to be successful and be on DoorDash."

(00:48:24):
So their motivation for selection is, "We want all of the merchants to thrive and survive." So that happens to give you better selection as a result. But the motivation was very different. So the analogy I use is Uber is to Amazon as DoorDash is to Shopify, if that makes sense. Amazon has always been more consumer focused, Shopify is obviously very merchant focused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:46):
Interesting.

John Mark Nickels (00:48:46):
And by the way, either of those, again, there's no right or wrong, is a fine strategy. They're both great companies. And I actually don't know if you could do both. Is it possible to be Amazon and Shopify? To really focus on consumers and build all the merchant restaurant tech? And maybe with enough resources and time, but that would lose focus. So it's like there's a trade-off there. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:08):
Yeah. Like at Airbnb, there was always this, "Should we optimize for hosts? Should we optimize for guests?" And there's always this like, "This time, guests are most important. Right now hosts are more..." Make these trade-off decisions in the marketplace. So it's interesting that at Uber, your insight there is Uber is always very rider focused, and DoorDash from its DNA was very merchant focused. You also talk about at DoorDash, there's this mentality of just going before figuring out where to go. Is there anything more there that might be helpful, either as a cautionary tale or as a lesson?

John Mark Nickels (00:49:37):
Yeah, I think it's a balance. It's back to I don't want to deliberate and pontificate for weeks on end about which door I should run through. And I don't want to go to the other extreme and just spend 30 seconds thinking about what to do and just go, go, go. So it's finding that kind of happy medium. If I had to pick one, I'd rather bias towards running through a wall than not doing anything, because you still get learnings from that and you either make progress or you don't, and that gives you feedback and you can run through another wall as a result. So I think the biggest failure case is probably erring on the other side of deliberating too long without action.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:15):
What about Waymo? What's something that you took away from that experience as a thing that you want to do more of or something you want to try to avoid?

John Mark Nickels (00:50:22):
Waymo is, you've probably seen people in San Francisco, they're quite prolific now in terms of they're all over San Francisco and you see them all the time. And I'm not sure, I can't remember the last time I saw one towed, I don't want to say that they've solved self-driving, but they are obviously driving at scale with very minimal, at least real world intervention. You can't tell by looking at the cars how many humans behind the scenes might be helping provide guidance of the car or whatever. But yeah, I would say what's really interesting about Waymo is they've largely solved the self-driving piece, however they've done that, and in a complex environment like San Francisco, and you see them driving in fog and rain and puddles, and it's like, wow, that's pretty cool.

(00:51:07):
But I think what Waymo was learning, and I was trying help them learn is that building a self-driving car on a test track is a very different problem statement than scaling a fleet of thousands of cars. And how do you operate them, clean them, charge them, maintain them, and then how do you build the ride share network? It's like, okay, well we got to build an app and we got to acquire users and do classic growth stuff and think about that marketplace and matching and pricing and those are very different skills. And so it's like a warning that those are different things.

(00:51:41):
And trying to hire for that and build culture around that was hard, honestly. It's just like you're kind of a different thing than the host organism. Most of the host organism is just obsessed with perception and planning and all the core autonomy pieces and you're like, the commercialization people there, "Well, now we've going to make money with this thing." That's why I think that's an example where your overall vision would say Waymo is to build Waymo One. Just be mindful that it's more than just one. There's multiple pillars of that. There's the self-driving piece, there's getting a lot of cars at scale, financing them, operating the fleet, getting the demand, filling the cars with people, and then it has to all come together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):
Right. Yeah. It's so interesting that your title is Lead Product for Commercialization of Autonomous Ride Hailing at Waymo, and now it's come full circle where at Uber, that's going to be in a sense the way that people call Waymo. And so it's so interesting that you've seen both sides of this.

John Mark Nickels (00:52:50):
Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens. I think Uber, it got out of the autonomy business when it divested Autonomous Technologies Group or Advanced Technologies Group. And right now our stated strategy is to be an aggregator. So it's like, we are partnering with Waymo, with Cruise, Motional, others in China, et cetera. And then the idea is to have every vehicle on the platform really, right? Autonomous or not. And then use the power of the platform, we have this big demand base, we have a lot of riders.

(00:53:22):
And so I think what you're seeing is, Waymo and Cruise and others are like, "Okay, now that we've developed autonomy, what's the path to profitability for us?" And so they can go it alone and try to build a ride-share network. And Waymo is doing that with Waymo One, but it turns out it takes a while. It's funny, I feel like engineers too are always skeptical of why other people's engineering problems take so much work. There'd be engineers at Waymo would be like, "Why does Uber have so many thousands of engineers? How hard can it be to build a ride-share app?"

(00:53:59):
But when you look at what made Uber successful, what we've been perfecting for the last decade, A, the marketplace tech that I alluded to earlier, but also how we manage a large rider base and doing rider support and driver support and logistics and all of the helping finance electric vehicles and working with regulators and cities and making sure we have safe and accessible pickup points and on and on and on. And those are all the depth of the iceberg that you don't really realize or think of when you're like, "Oh, I can just build a ride-share app." Right? Tesla publishes their sigma design and some earnings report and everyone goes crazy like, "Wow, okay, well I don't want to bet against Elon because that sounds scary," but there is more to it than just the app and the autonomy.

(00:54:46):
So yeah, I think these companies will have an interesting question. Do they go alone, build their own ride-share network to capture all the value, or do they say, "Well, I could just work with Uber and have a faster path to high utilization of the vehicles," which unlocks financing and more vehicles and that gets them to scale faster? And so if you look at the landscape right now, it's a bit of both, right? Waymo is obviously working with Uber in Phoenix and we just announced Cruise will come back to some city next year I think, but Waymo is also still building their own thing, so they're kind of hedging their bets at the moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:18):
I want to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast that I call Contrarian Corner. I feel like you're going to have a good answer here. What's something that you believe that most other people don't believe?

John Mark Nickels (00:55:32):
One is back to being aware of your internal state and allowing emotions and thoughts is... Emotions in the workplace, a lot of people have the thing of like, "Well, there's no need for emotion in the workplace. We're going to be logical. We're going to be data-driven. Keep your feelings at home. Just show up and presentation J.M. Mode." And I guess in my experience, there's this thing around whole body intelligence and whole body, yes, which is yes, there is signal from the head and logic and data and left brain reasoning are amazing and it could be great, but there's also heart and gut. And to me, what is an emotion? It's just energy moving on the body. Often it's correlated with a thought too as well. I might have a thought that creates fear and so forth.

(00:56:23):
But to me there's wisdom in emotion and I can start to access noticing them more. Like where do I feel sadness in the body? I notice I feel fear in the kind of center of my chest, and then sadness is like a sinking feeling in my stomach. And I notice when I'm angry, my jaw gets tight and my eyes furrow a little bit. And so those are common ones, but you may have your own little signatures of you pick up where is joy, where is creative energy? Where is fear or sadness, anger? And then noticing those in a meeting or in a conversation or review. And actually if you're willing, even just voice it to other people, that's like the next step. But start with just acknowledging it to yourself.

(00:57:02):
And so for me, the wisdom of emotions is fear is something wants to be paid attention to. There can be the saber-toothed tiger is not really Dara disapproving of me, whatever. I shouldn't be afraid of that. But there are times where fear is applicable. There might be fear around, let's say back at Waymo, you want to be really intentional about safety and you want to be super... That's one of the things I love about Waymo is they're very committed to having a super strong safety record. And so there might be fear around did we really consider all the edge cases of what might happen if a dog runs in the street or a ball or child or whatever, and you might see wow, fear. It's great. The wisdom of that is something wants to be paid attention to and listened to. Okay, great.

(00:57:46):
Sadness for me is something wants to be let go of. There's a mourning, there's a letting go of I had an idea or vision for the future that will no longer be because whatever, something happened, other people don't want to do it, this or that. But it could be a vision of a relationship, it could be a vision of what you thought your life would look like, whatever. We all go through those sorts of things.

(00:58:07):
And there might be micro-moments of sadness of like, wow, that feature didn't work. It's like I really wanted it to be successful. I just let go of that, welcome the sadness. Anger to me is something is not of service to me or my people or my mission or whatever I'm up to. And so again, that can be a great signal to like, okay, I pay attention to that. I want to change something. And then joy is something that wants to be celebrated. We had a great win. We nailed the OKR, we had a great product launch. A lot of times we spend too much time moving back into the next, okay, let's set another goal. It's like, it's okay to stop and celebrate.

(00:58:45):
And then creative energy is something wants to be born into the world. It's like it's almost like I'm going to birth an idea or a vision or some new product thing and then just tuning into that. So yeah, I would say welcome emotions, maybe even talk about them, god forbid, in the workplace. Imagine that instead of having a OKR review where you're behind target and everyone's blaming other people, and you could tell when it's kind of fearful, if someone was just like, "Wow, I noticed that I just feel fear around this." Everyone was like, "Wow, I feel fear too." That would just totally change the tone of the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:20):
The advice here is bring your emotions into work. Don't let emotions... What most people believe is leave your emotions at home, don't bring your emotions into the workplace, and what you've found is they actually can make you more effective and make your teams more effective. And you even talked about it helps you make decisions in a more intelligent way because your gut and lizard brain almost tells you things that you should pay attention to.

John Mark Nickels (00:59:46):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):
I love that. Okay, so I'm going to close with a question that is rooted in something that you shared with me when we were chatting about this podcast that I think is going to be helpful to a lot of people. What have you found to be keys to a successful, impactful, rich, fun life?

John Mark Nickels (01:00:05):
It's a great question, and I think lots of people have different prescriptions for that, and I don't claim to have the one truth around that, but the first thing I would say as a meta observation is I spend a lot of time thinking about objective functions. We design algorithms to do matching and pricing and think about short-term effects and long-term effects. And so I really am ingrained in this idea of we have an objective function for our life. And then the problem is that a lot of us aren't conscious of it. It's just like an implied OF that you inherited values from your church or community or what your parents valued or what you learned to be good at, and I do this for work and blah, blah, blah, and I'm just kind of bobbing along.

(01:00:49):
That's why I love Ray Dalio's principle thing where it's like, Hey, write down your values and your principles and get clear on what they are. Or Clayton Christensen wrote a great book that he's less known for, he's obviously known for Innovator's Dilemma, but he wrote a book called How Will You Measure Your Life? And he was trying to answer this question of, he teaches whatever, MBA students at Harvard, and he's like, "Wow, all these executives are super successful. They're like Fortune 500 execs. They're most super successful, but they're all divorced and their kids hate them and their personal lives are a mess. What's happening?" And so one of the key insights he comes to is like, it's Sunday night and you have the choice of playing with your daughter, or you're reading a book or playing a game, and you have a presentation to Dara on Monday. And he's like, "Well, I could make those slides a little bit better and I could go practice or knock out some emails," or whatever it is you want to do.

(01:01:49):
And so what he basically found was the type A exec, successful people are very short-term OF driven. They're like, "Well, presentation's tomorrow, and that can either go great or okay based on Sunday night." Whereas like, "My daughter will be here, I'll play with her next week." And the problem is that he's getting in this cycle where it's like, okay, you start working every Sunday night and then years and years go by and suddenly you don't have a relationship with your daughter who's now a teenager.

(01:02:16):
But I think we're just not conscious of that. So to me, the first piece of advice would be get clear on your objective function. And one way that I've gotten clear on it is trying to think about it from future me. Because five years from now, I'm not going to give a shit if I made the presentation slightly better, but I'm going to care a lot about what kind of relationship I have with my daughters. And that means that the next action, the next thing I do today and tomorrow, those will translate into the relationship with her. And I think a lot of us aren't just tuned into that.

(01:02:49):
I love the stoic stuff, being mindful of death, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, all those great ones. Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. And we try to avoid that and we try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed. We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work and go on vacation and do what we do. And that can lead us to doing things that ultimately don't matter in the long run, and focusing on the wrong things.

(01:03:28):
And so to me, it's like an awareness and mindfulness that our lives will come to an end punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities, stop wasting time on things that don't matter with people who matter. This relationship, this journey, it will come to an end. I'm actually tearing up and feeling tingly just saying that. It's like even right now, come back to it. How am I going to spend my afternoon? Am I going to hug my daughters? Am I going to spend time with them after work or am I going to do email all night? What would I wish I had done when I'm in my last breath?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):
There's a quote that I heard once that really stuck with me that I think is going to hit a lot of people really hard, which is that the only people that will remember you working late every night is your kids.

John Mark Nickels (01:04:32):
Wow. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):
Yeah. An important reminder. J.M., we've covered a lot of stuff. Is there anything else that you think might be helpful for people that you want to leave listeners with? Or we're going to have a lightning round coming up, but before we get that, we ended on a really powerful, impactful note. Is there anything else along these lines that you think might be helpful for people that you want to leave them with?

John Mark Nickels (01:05:01):
The one thing I'd encourage folks to do out of all of these we talked about is to see if you'd be willing to commit to breaking out of victim consciousness and mentality. And it's not to say there aren't victims in the world, there are real injustices and things happening, but most of us, I've experienced, I often can fall into the trap of living my life at the effect of, right? I'm at the effect of other people and what they do. I'm at the effect of circumstances like COVID or Trump or whatever. I'm at the effect of the conditions and circumstances of life, and I feel like life is happening to me.

(01:05:39):
And so to me, the most empowering and radical transformation that I've been able to cultivate and develop is shifting from that to a state of I I am willing to take responsibility for how I see the world. And I may not be able to change the weather or the election or all that, but I can change how I'm being in relationship to it and choose to see it as a growth opportunity, as learning, how am I co-creating it, even things that I play a small part in, injustice in the world, how am I perpetuating that and being willing to see the world as I'm the painter of my existence?

(01:06:11):
I think Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is probably the best example of that. He's in a super oppressive situation that is very horrific and tragic, and the way he described his relationship with the people in the camp and the guards, and he given he gave a talk after he was free, the amount of compassion and empathy he had for his oppressors was just amazing. So I'm like, well, if he can do that in the face of those conditions, I can show up differently in a product review or in a conversation with my partner or meeting or whatever it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Yeah, I think just that skill alone is such a powerful unlock for a lot of people instead of, here's all the things that I don't have and here's all the things that are setting you back and all the things that are hard for me versus other people. Shifting to, I need to take responsibility for my own success and no one else will. And just taking agency is a really powerful thing. It's easier said than done. There's a lot of hardships. People have a lot of things that they don't have that other people have that are hurting their career and hurting their ability to be successful, but still, the more you can take responsibility and have agency and the less you have this victim mentality, I 1,000% agree, there's so much power there. So that's an awesome lesson to end on. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round jam. Are you ready?

John Mark Nickels (01:07:34):
I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:35):
Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

John Mark Nickels (01:07:41):
In the realm of the soft skills and conscious leadership, the best one is the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership by Diana Chapman and Jim Dethmer. And those were my early coaches and teachers almost 10 years ago, and Diana is still my coach. So I think that's a fantastic book that we'll go into more detail about some of the things we talked about around fear and threat versus trust and drawing a triangle and all that great stuff. That'd be one that I'd definitely recommend first. Another one more in the content world is I think you had Nancy Duarte on your podcast one point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):
Yeah, Nancy Duarte. Yeah.

John Mark Nickels (01:08:17):
Or Duarte, sorry. I love her book Resonate. I know she has some other ones too, on slide design and stuff. But what was so cool about that, I gave it to PMs all the time when I'm trying to help them develop their communication, storytelling, and presentation skills. And she goes through those TED talks and Martin Luther King, I have a dream, and going to the Moon, and basically make the spark line against it to understand this concept of resonance with the audience. It's actually a great skill for, back to vision and north-starring, she said what all these things do is they alternate tension between the world as it is and the world as it might be. And it's like, here's that beautiful future of transportation, San Francisco, blah, blah, blah, but here's why it sucks today, all these problems and this and that, but here's how it could look in a few years.

(01:09:05):
And then you're creating that tension and the audience at the end is like sweaty palms and like, "I want to help build that future." What do you need? You need money, you need time, resources, join your company. Great. So anyway, Resonate, Nancy Duarte, great book. Those would be some of the top two that I recommend. There's not one specific book, but I really love Alan Watts' books if you're into... He was one of the first people to articulate and kind of import Buddhism and that sort of Eastern thinking into the West, and he just has a very satirical, comical sort of not taking myself too seriously style and just like the way he explains a lot of those concepts. So that'd be another one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):
He also has an amazing voice if you listen to recordings of him with music, it's just so fun to listen to.

John Mark Nickels (01:09:52):
Totally. Actually, Sam Harris's Waking Up app now has the entire... he worked with I think Alan Watts' son. So the Waking Up app has all 80 or 100 hours of recorded Alan Watts lectures.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:03):
Oh my god. There's YouTube videos.

John Mark Nickels (01:10:06):
[inaudible 01:10:06]

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:06):
There's some awesome YouTube videos of him that are worth watching, we'll link to some of those. And then Nancy Duarte, she shared exactly that lesson on the podcast that we had together. So if you don't want to read the book and listen to her give this tactic of this way to communicate a vision, you can listen to that episode, we'll link to it. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you have really enjoyed?

John Mark Nickels (01:10:28):
Yeah. The last movie I really enjoyed was Inside Out 2 with my kids, which is very-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:34):
I could see why you'd love that.

John Mark Nickels (01:10:36):
Yes, consistent with the emotional awareness and allowing the different emotional parts and don't want to spoil the movie, maybe everyone hasn't seen it, but it's very simpatico with that lesson of you can't just let one emotion run the show, they all have wisdom. On the first one, Sadness, Joy learning that Sadness is necessary. It's all about integration, but it was beautiful the way kids understand it and it's a way to teach emotional literacy to your kids. So I think what they've done there with those Inside Out movies is just brilliant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? It could be an app, it could be something physical.

John Mark Nickels (01:11:11):
Yeah, so Eight Sleep is a smart mattress company. They're on their third or fourth rev now, but it's like a Tempur-Pedic mattress, or you can put their cover on any mattress, but it has a cover that has little tubes of water, and then it has a little computer thing and you fill with water and then an app. And basically what you do is you program it and it learns, it has sensors, it can measure your heart rate, your HRV, body temperature, all that, but you're basically trying to program a temperature curve to help you maximize your kind of REM sleep and deep sleep and get more value out of the sleep that you do have.

(01:11:41):
And so for me, it's super cool early for deep sleep, and then it warms you up as you want to wake up, which is... or an alarm and all that. But it's back to my thing about wanting to show up with the right mindset and energy and aliveness. Having really high quality sleep has been a really key part of that, is like if I don't sleep well, I didn't get enough sleep or didn't sleep well, you're already starting off on a bad foot. So yeah, if you haven't checked out Eight Sleep, great product. No endorsement fee for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:12):
What's also cool about it is it tracks your sleep. It gives you all these stats. Instead of wearing a ring, and it gives you all these stats about your sleep quality. And there's this guy, Brian Johnson, I don't know if you follow him, he's like this guy that's trying to stay alive as long as possible, and he had a perfect sleep score for six months in a row to set the record.

John Mark Nickels (01:12:30):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:30):
Yeah. He knows what he's doing over there. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, think of, find useful in work or in life?

John Mark Nickels (01:12:42):
Yeah, I probably have had different ones over the years. The one right now that really serves me is there's this track called Sit Around the Fire by Jon Hopkins, but it's on Spotify, Apple Music, but it's basically music with one of Ram Dass' talks, lesser known talks. And so the mantra that's been really serving me recently is the very first part of that, which is he says, "Beyond all polarities, I am. Let the judgments and opinions of the mind be the judgments and opinions of the mind. And you exist behind that." So sometimes I have an abbreviated version of that where I'm noticing I'm activated, I'm clinging to an opinion, I'm arguing with somebody, and I'm just like, "Beyond all polarities."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:44):
An abbreviated version.

John Mark Nickels (01:13:45):
I do that in front of my kids and they laugh at me like, "Daddy is so weird sometimes."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:47):
Beyond all polarities, kids. That's so funny. Oh man. There's another Ram Dass line that I often use with my wife, Be Here Now, which is the title of his book that everyone sees with the blue cover. And I do that when she's on her phone and we're doing something. I'm like, "Be here now." And she's like, "Okay, okay. I'll put my phone away." Yeah. Final question. I was going to ask you about the line tracking and what you learned from that. You already shared an awesome lesson from that time. So let me ask you something else. I'll ask you about Travis. Any crazy, fun, memorable stories of working with Travis Kalanick? However you say his last name, Kalanick, Kalanick?

John Mark Nickels (01:14:27):
Travis Kalanick, yeah. Yeah. I'll share a quick one that's short but sweet or hilarious to me, and maybe lesser known. So we used to have the Uber office at 1455 Market, and so there was one conference room where we'd often do reviews with Travis, and it wasn't the war room, whatever whenever room it was. That was interior and no windows. So this room had windows overlooking, what was that? 11th street. So 11th and Market. And so we'd have a presentation up on the projector, some big screen we're about to go through something with Travis. And reliably, every time he'd come in, he would close the blinds of the windows. Everyone like, "Travis, what are we doing?" It's not because there was glare. They were orthogonal to the screen. And then one time I was like, "Why are you doing that?" He's like, "I'm pretty sure Lyft has drones outside the windows of our office and they're spying on our presentation."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:19):
Oh my gosh.

John Mark Nickels (01:15:23):
I was like, whoa, your competitor paranoia runs deep, man. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:32):
It's hard to mention Lyft doing that. I could see Uber doing that to Lyft.

John Mark Nickels (01:15:36):
Old Uber. Uber 1.0

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Old Uber. Yeah. Wow. That's amazing. It's like coaches in the NFL that are covering their lips always when they're telling and giving plays, just like, I wonder if people actually do that. That's amazing. Yeah, I get that. It's like high stakes. You never know. Might be a drone out there.

John Mark Nickels (01:15:54):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):
Amazing. J.M., what a roller coaster of a conversation. We covered so much ground. I can't even name all the things we covered. So let me just ask you two final questions. Where can folks find you online and reach out if they want to work with you? I know you work with folks, talk about that. And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

John Mark Nickels (01:16:13):
Yeah, yeah. So I am occasionally on Twitter @NickelsJM, but I don't tweet a lot, but maybe I should start. But the best way to find more about my thoughts and thinking on the soft skill stuff is a website called rhythmofbeing.com. And I've got some blog posts and stuff there that go into detail on some of these things. And yeah, I do a little bit of coaching on the side with folks. I do very little now. My day job at Uber and my night job with my kids takes up most of my waking hours. But for the right person and a few select spots, I can make time. But yeah, that's the best place to find me, is rhythmofbeing.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
And then how can listeners be useful to you?

John Mark Nickels (01:16:57):
Well, in the spirit of welcoming and embracing feedback, you could most be useful by reaching out, telling me what resonated, what didn't, what was useful, where did your energy go up when I talked, and where did your energy go down? Because that to me is a signal of where I'm back to tracking the life, where's the juice? And then that way in the future when I do other versions of this or other conversations, I'll pay more attention to the energy up stuff and go more there, and the energy down was like, okay, maybe that wasn't as interesting or didn't resonate. Great. No problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):
J.M., thank you so much for being here.

John Mark Nickels (01:17:38):
Thank you for having me.

## Transcript

Jonathan Becker (00:00:00):
There's a lot of different ways that we are beginning to use AI to do more with less, basically. The effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. We have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic. It's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers. And less so the like trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.

(00:00:35):
On our creative group, we can come up with mockups, in literally, 1% of the time that it took. And so you still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, "Do we like this more or do we like this more?" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jonathan Becker. Jonathan is a legend and an OG in the world of performance marketing. On this podcast, we've done deep dives into the many aspects of growth, including SEO, sales, conversion optimization, retention, product led growth, product led sales. But this is the first episode where we get super deep on paid growth. For the past decade plus, Jonathan and his team have planned, built, and executed more than $3.5 billion in paid acquisition budgets for companies like Uber, Asana, Square, Masterclass, Tempur-Pedic, and many more. And they've built their agency, Thrive Digital, into one of the preeminent independent digital marketing agencies. In our conversation, we get real deep into all things paid growth, including what's changed with recent privacy shifts, why focusing on creatives is the new biggest opportunity within paid growth. How to think about attribution, and what's changed there. What to look for in people you hire to run paid growth for you, how AI is already changing how paid growth teams operate, and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Jonathan Becker after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:16):

Jonathan, welcome to the podcast.

Jonathan Becker (00:04:48):
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

Lenny (00:04:50):
It's my pleasure. What we're going to be doing with this episode, is we're going to be digging real deep into all things paid growth, which we've never done on this podcast yet. And normally I actually skip this part, but I thought it'd be actually helpful for you to spend a little bit of time to give us a little bit of background on your experience in the space of performance marketing, AKA paid growth, AKA paid ads. You tell us what the right term is for this genre. But yeah, just tell us what you've been up to in this area over the past decade and a half, I think.

Jonathan Becker (00:05:20):
Sure. No, that's a great way to kick things off. And again, thank you for having me here. If I think about it, my experience goes back about 15 years into this space. I started off as a web developer. And as I built and structured websites for people, I became pretty obsessed and fascinated with the fact that you could build landing pages or homepages, or whatever it was. Basically the content on a website, and structure it in a manner where you had the chance to surface in organic, so SEO results more prominently. And as I became a practitioner of SEO, SEO really being my first love of marketing, I started attracting attention and people wanted to hire me on as a freelancer. And what I noticed is that as people started asking me questions like, what was the ROI of our SEO campaign? Or, how do I scale this, or whatnot? The answers to their questions ended up being a lot more aligned with what then was the biggest driver in the paid acquisition world, which was paid search.

(00:06:25):
And so I started experimenting with paid search. And what I found was that it was a tangible format and lever through which we could basically give people the types of results they were expecting from SEO, but that were obfuscated in terms of Google's analysis algorithm from an organic point of view being somewhat intangible. And Google slowly removing a lot of the data early on that allowed you to guess and test more easily. 10 plus years later, what started off as this freelancer consultancy that I started running in a walk-in closet in my old apartment, became 130 people. And we manage about $500 million a year in ad spend for small and large companies, including Uber, Asana, Tempur-Pedic. We've worked with Lululemon. Very exciting companies, mostly from the United States, even though we randomly happen to be based in Vancouver, Canada.

Lenny (00:07:26):
There's a number of threads I'm going to pull on there over the course of our chat. But you mentioned Uber and you told me that you had a crazy story about how you actually landed Uber as a customer. Could you share that?

Jonathan Becker (00:07:35):
I had been running Thrive for a couple years, and it was a very excellent regional agency in Canada with really cool local clients. In 2013, I got invited to go down to the TED conference, which was in Long Beach, California. And my friend Andrew Wilkinson asked me to join him at a dinner that night. I didn't know anybody from the TED community at the time. So we have dinner, and then afterwards as it goes at conferences, there's an after party. And so essentially I hop into a taxi, everybody else sped off in their cars, or however which way they were getting there. And as we're talking to the driver saying, "Hey, we're going to this place, can you take us?" There's a knock on the window and the person outside says, "Hey, I think I'm heading to the same destination. Do you mind if I hop in this car with you?"

(00:08:25):
And so we're like, of course. And I turn to him and I'm like, "I'm Jonathan. I run a 10 person agency out of Vancouver." And he says, "Hey, I'm Garrett Camp. I started a company called Uber." And so ironically, I meet the founder of Uber, the company that is in the process of disrupting the entire taxi industry worldwide in the back of a taxi cab. And what happened next basically changed my career forever. We end up at this party. At the time I was spamming Uber's referral program. Kind of a long story, but essentially I was using paid search to camp out on their branded keywords. And as people would sign up with my confusingly similar snippet to Uber's organic snippet, I was essentially siphoning off referral credits. So I would get $20 every single time someone signed up.

(00:09:18):
And I ended up making tens of thousands of dollars doing this. And so fast-forward, I'm getting a drink at the bar next to Garrett, and in my head I'm like, should I tell him about this? Maybe I can land them as a client. This would be really interesting. And essentially I tell him, I'm like, "Hey, I'm doing this. I'm adding zero value, but this is a loophole in your marketing system, and someone should close it." He essentially is like, "I need to report this to the board, but here's my card, write me what you're doing and we'll contact you." And so I get contacted by a bunch of his lieutenants. If you've read the book, Super Pumped. All the people that we dealt with at the time are in the book, and [inaudible 00:09:58]-

Lenny (00:09:58):
I watched the show.

Jonathan Becker (00:10:00):
Yeah, exactly. And they were like, "Hey, this is bad, you have to stop doing this. But can we hire you to solve the problem?" And so what started off as me running projects for local bars in Vancouver, or clothing stores, or whatever it was. Turned into me landing early stage Uber as a client, and really graduating us from competent professionals to leaders in our sector. And so it was a fascinating project, and we worked with Uber for 10 years.

Lenny (00:10:32):
That is an incredible story. I love the arbitrage game you're running there. It's basically siphoning VC money out of Uber. And I guess the lesson there a little bit is just sometimes it's this interesting combination of hustle in terms of just make some money, and also taking advantage of this opportunity you were plopped into.

Jonathan Becker (00:10:53):
Yeah. I think people often talk about entrepreneurs who have been successful and they comment that they're lucky. Whereas, I actually look at that situation and I think that you have to make your own luck. I could have been like, oh, cool, I met this guy in the back of a taxi and that was it. But I decided to take a risk, being that I could get embarrassed or nothing could happen, or they could shut down this referral gimmicky thing that I was doing. I had very little to lose, I guess, ultimately. But a lot of people just don't make these moves in life because they're nervous, or they're worried too much about what the downside might be. And so I very much was like, I'm going to shoot my shot here. And you put yourself in situations where everybody has luck, but you have to capitalize on it basically. And so that was an example of being willing to take a risk, and it paying off pretty big time I think.

Lenny (00:11:46):
Also, being at Ted, that seems like a good move. Networking, paying off. Love that he was in a taxi, that's hilarious. I was going to ask you about that. And clearly, he's doing some research [inaudible 00:11:55].

Jonathan Becker (00:11:54):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:58):
Let's start diving into the world of paid growth. And if you think about just paid growth.. And again, actually, what do you refer to this area as? Paid growth, performance marketing, paid ads?

Jonathan Becker (00:12:08):
There's a lot of interchangeable terms. Performance marketing is a common term. Paid acquisition is a common term. Some people think of those two things as growth marketing, whereas I see growth marketing as a bigger practice area within which paid acquisition sits. And then of course there's subsets, there's social ads, there's paid search, there's programmatic. And so there's a lot of different ways of saying the same thing.

Lenny (00:12:31):
I'm going to use performance marketing. I like that term because it really describes what it is. It's like marketing with you can measure performance. Let's see how that goes. As a channel, it's such an interesting mix of, on the one hand it's this incredible growth lever that allows basically any company to spend money and understand the ROI and acquiring the users. This thing that never existed before. Essentially Facebook and Google created these platforms. On the other hand, there's this sense that it's this drug that you start and then you get hooked on and you can never leave. And there's a lot of advice of just, avoid paid growth. That's just not a good healthy way of growing, especially as a startup. And so my question to you is just, how do you think about that element of it? And then even more specifically, what products do you find paid growth as a channel is right for and not right for?

Jonathan Becker (00:13:24):
Yeah, it's a really great question. And so, I think there's a couple different things that need to be unpacked here. Paid acquisition or performance marketing-

Lenny (00:13:33):
Performance marketing. [inaudible 00:13:35]-

Jonathan Becker (00:13:34):
... you can call it, can be seen as a drug, I suppose, when you are entirely reliant on it to fuel the revenue of your business. The analogy that I try and use here is that it would be very dangerous if I was advising you with your life savings and I told you to put it all in a single stock in the stock market. Stocks can be volatile. And as a result of that, your net worth would fluctuate quite a bit in the short-term and the long-term based on a lot of things that you don't control, like the external markets, or things that are happening within the performance of that particular company that you invested in. When I think about all of the marketing mix, so email, direct mail, linear television, performance, marketing, whatever it is, I think about it as investing capital with the expectation of a return. And in the same manner that I would not take all of your life savings and dump it into a single stock, I don't recommend putting all of your money into a single performance marketing channel, and then somewhat exposing you to the volatility of fluctuating CPCs or changing market conditions. I would agree with you that it is a drug, in a sense, if you have all of your eggs in one basket, and that basket takes you on a very intense rollercoaster in terms of performance. But when I think about the fact that Thrive manages $500 million a year, I think of myself to a extent as a fund manager, we are managing people's money with the expectation of a return. And part of the strategy is to diversify across channels. And so we decrease the reliance of any individual project on a singular channel and its performance.

(00:15:26):
And similarly, I always say to people that the first rule of performance marketing is not to forget about offline marketing and the classic marketing that works for organizations. In other words, direct mail can really work, email marketing works beautifully, SEO can really work. There's all of these wonderful things at your disposal. The real crash and burn scenarios that I've seen are these, not fly by night brands, but brands that figured out... Just like with Uber, I figured out this weird tie-in where I could make free money from their referral system. Sometimes people find shortcuts, hacks if you will, to scale rapidly because of one specific nuance of the Facebook ad platform, or something like that. And what they fail to see is that those loopholes come and go.

(00:16:19):
And so if they scale massively and their entire business is predicated on the performance of this one loophole that they found, or investing everything in a single channel, and then the conditions change, they're not going to be very happy and the business will suffer dramatically. And so when I think about this, it's a responsible channel mix, diversity, and understanding that you can't be overly reliant on performance marketing for the success or failure of your business.

Lenny (00:16:48):
What about the second part of that question of when you think about when companies come to you. What do you look for to help you understand this is going to be a really good fit for performance marketing and this is going to give them a lot of opportunity to growth, versus maybe not, maybe it'll be a small sliver but it's not going to be a massive success for them?

Jonathan Becker (00:17:06):
Yeah. I would say that the answer to that question is different at different stages of a company's life cycle. Early stage, look at what the company is doing, look at your own company. Have you established product market fit? Is this an idea that has yet to be tested, and are they entirely looking to performance marketing to scale everything? Are they at risk of it becoming an over-reliance on performance marketing? At a later stage we look at certain criteria that they might or might not possess. Typically, that will come down to resourcing.

(00:17:43):
The question at a later stage is not, does it work? But, to what scale can it work? And so we are looking at things like, do they have adequate creative resources and buy-in? Does creative resourcing tie into performance, and can we create a feedback loop there around testing? I'll talk to you about that in a bit. Do they have professional marketers on staff? Are there people who have experience doing what we do, that speak our language so to speak? Or is part of this an organizational educational, and creating buy-in through stakeholders process that needs to take place? Do they have technical resources? If we say, "Hey, tracking and attribution is broken, here's how to solve that." Can you implement it? And so on and so forth.

(00:18:27):
There's no one magic formula for what works or what type of company will be successful on performance marketing channels. Just as evidence of this, Google, which I think had a down quarter reported sales this week, and it was $70 billion in three months. And Facebook similarly just recorded yesterday evening, and it was $32 billion. That's $100 billion on just Google and Facebook in three months, and the majority of that revenue is from ads. This works really well for lots of different companies, it's just a question of at what scale.

Lenny (00:19:06):
Just to pull an thread a little bit more. Something I've heard from other guests is that paid ads are best for products where you get basically payback really quickly, basically to feed the flywheel of spend so that you're not sitting around waiting for someone to buy something in the future, or it's a small trickle of pay. How important is that, I guess? Do you find that you could just do paid growth for any company, it doesn't matter their business model? Or is there something you're like, okay, this needs to exist for you to invest serious resources? And even hire that team that you just talked about.

Jonathan Becker (00:19:37):
It's always nice when there's a quick turnaround on investment and return. And that's wonderful for like D2C or e-commerce style businesses where they're essentially taking the revenue to fuel additional inventory and operating costs. However, not all businesses work that way. And so, in a B2C or B2B lead generation scenario, we have to undertake pretty sophisticated modeling around these abstract concepts, like lifetime value. Which is difficult, because most businesses are relatively new that we work with, and so the idea of lifetime value is a misnomer. They don't know what that is yet.

(00:20:15):
But we have to model things like LTV to CAC, so cost per acquisition costs versus lifetime value and the period within which the payback occurs. You end up getting to a pretty sophisticated place where you can build out things like a lead scoring model, which predictively can determine in a statistically significant way the likelihood that one lead will convert to revenue over another. And so there are ways around the slower payback period that still end up being pretty accurate based on what you're bidding on today versus the latent revenue that will be accrued to those campaigns through attribution.

Lenny (00:20:58):
Do you have any just rules of thumb for someone listening and trying to decide, is paid a real model for us, either on LTV or CAC, or payback period? Or something just like, here's what you probably should have, especially early stage for you to feel like paid growth is going to be a great lever for you to use, and maybe a primary lever.

Jonathan Becker (00:21:18):
Product market fit. If you know that your business sells into audiences. Let's say you are a social media influencer or you had a really strong email marketing game, or organically your content surfaces within Google search results. Or, you did a lot of direct mail and linear television and billboard advertising and that worked. If other things work, it is highly likely that paid acquisition will work. The issue for most companies is in this incorrect assumption that the data that is provided through paid channels allows you to have full end-to-end understanding of attribution. Which is wrong, it's never been that way. And the other aspect of this is the patience to understand that every business is unique, and these metrics that we know are important are different for every business. Lifetime value, like propensity to repurchase, ROAS, which is return on amount spent, CPA, CAC, all of these different things are different for every business.

(00:22:24):
Even if I worked with two hotels in the same city, they would have different results based on the nuances of their budget, their brand, the market that they sit within, the services that they offer, and so on and so forth. I think that everything else, the main problem here is that nobody should expect an overnight turnaround with performance marketing. It is a very difficult channel to manage, and that's why people hire experts like us to help them with it because it's a never ending problem with constantly changing issues. It's always been like that, that's not a new thing since pandemic, or whatever. And it will take some time to work out what works.

Lenny (00:23:07):
I have this framework of there's these four growth channels, basically growth engines is what I call them. There's paid/performance marketing. There's SEO, there's virality in their sales. And essentially there's some companies whose growth is almost primarily paid. A few that come to mind are booking.com, which we know well at Airbnb, which is almost all paid growth driven. Credit Karma comes to mind as a classic paid performance marketing. I keep coming to paid growth as my term, so I'm just going to stick with that. TikTok initially was very performance marketing, paid growth oriented. Wish was another one I think about.

(00:23:42):
And I want to talk about how much things are changing within this realm. But before we get there, do you think there's still an opportunity for startups to emerge where they get to scale almost exclusively through performance marketing? And this question actually came from Twitter, someone tweeted this randomly the other day. And I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan. And by the way, her name is Liz.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan, and by the way, her name is Liz Georgie asked this question, so there you go.

Jonathan Becker (00:24:06):
I'll put it this way. Every unicorn from the 2010s era that scale did performance marketing, but not everyone during that time who did performance marketing scaled. So I want to remove the bias here that just because all the successful organizations did this didn't mean that it was a magical channel for everyone. We had plenty of projects that we worked on that flatlined during that period. And so the sense that there was a period of time where this was easy or it worked on any project is not correct in my opinion. With that said, we see companies that are spending millions of dollars a month on performance marketing channels like Google and Meta still, despite all the ups and downs that they have faced and they do so profitably.

(00:24:55):
And I think there's some really great examples of companies that have scaled in relatively recent times, almost exclusively through paid. Grammarly is a really good example of this. They have been good at solving for this problem that exists around understanding the cost per acquisition versus lifetime value, how sticky customers are, predicting how much revenue can come from a customer and backing out into therefore how much we can pay per click and per lead and so on and so forth. Athletic Greens is another good example. So Athletic Greens is actually a pretty old company. I think they've been around for 10 years. I think they have retail distribution. I think they have done a lot of the more classic marketing things that are important in terms of developing that channel mix. But I think the amplification of that brand really, really gained traction quite recently where now everybody knows what Athletic Greens is, and that's because they're buying loads of ads on TikTok. They're buying loads of ads on other social channels like Facebook. They're investing in podcasting partnerships. But this is all digital paid acquisition.

(00:26:07):
And so it had a wonderful effect on this really interesting business that they had already built. So yes, it's still doable. We still see people doing it, and I think that there's been a bit of a reckoning in the performance marketing industry pertaining to things like privacy and the changes that Apple made and people being very creeped out at how their data is being used rightfully so. And then obviously the economy in 2022, we had a terrible macroeconomic shift where interest rates rise and inflation's out of control. And so of course the first thing that people cut are typically marketing budgets and we see Facebook and Google and other ad channels directly suffering from that. So all of that said, these storms pass. And so when the economy improves, generally speaking, I imagine people will go back to trying to find as much inventory from a pay per click point of view that they can purchase as possible and figuring out the economics of how to do that.

Lenny (00:27:08):
I was definitely going to ask about that, and I love that you touched on it, just clearly a lot is changing in paid growth/performance marketing recently. You talked about the privacy stuff, you talked about COVID kind of shifted the way people spend and kind of dropped and then came back. So my question is who are you finding has the most success these days in performance marketing? And I will plant one seed, which from the examples you just shared, it feels like it's mostly companies that are very efficient. I think Grammarly, they're just super efficient as a business. And then I think Analytic Greens, they're a sponsor and their negotiations for sponsoring is just like, okay, here's the number that makes sense for them financially, and they're not going to go anywhere above that.

Jonathan Becker (00:27:49):
Yeah. Because they know, they understand how many impressions they'll get and on average what the quality of impression is and how many dollars they can put behind that before it has a cliff in terms of ROI.

Lenny (00:28:05):
Exactly. So broadly, who do you think is having the most success now with the changes and then generally, what should people know about what has changed in the past say year in the space of performance marketing?

Jonathan Becker (00:28:18):
I'm not going to really be able to point to this company is really getting it right and I think that you can do that, but it's like saying, a friend of mine who recently on Twitter tweeted this funny thing where he was like, this is the number that I used to win the lottery said every successful founder ever trying to give advice to other founders. And so in other words, just because they won the lottery doesn't mean you're going to be successful picking the same number.

(00:28:43):
To that extent, there is a bit of a playbook around modern day performance marketing, and that includes everything from really stringent and rigorous creative testing and thinking about that correctly to understanding the subjectivity of attribution and its strengths and weaknesses, doing a lot of work around validity of these campaigns. So really just the measurement and whatnot. Companies that can do those things and then understand their own marketing economics, in other words, quite basically how much can we afford to spend in acquiring a customer on any channel before that acquisition is no longer profitable. So really focusing on the profitability of the bottom line and not just break net growth, for instance. Companies that have those capabilities and see the world that way tend to be successful in performance marketing.

Lenny (00:29:39):
When you were giving your intro, you talked about how you initially started doing SEO, that's where you started, and then you moved to paid growth. Well, how do you think about those two investments as a founder trying to decide which direction to go? What would your advice be of spend your time here versus there if X, Y, Z?

Jonathan Becker (00:29:56):
When I'm asked a question of should we put money into organic search or paid search? My response is often that they're actually not mutually exclusive to one another. So it's a great idea to do both, and that backs into my strategy of diversification of channels. So don't build up exclusively in one area and create volatility within your marketing mix essentially. SEO is a wonderful marketing capability when it's built out correctly. I think the issues that you run into are cause and effect related. So one of the things that people really like about performance marketing theoretically is that we can spend a certain amount and then if we're modeling things correctly, we can essentially determine how much revenue is generated from the actions that we took. Finance teams love that, C-suite teams love that, they can build projections, they can budget around it. There's some degree of predictability around it if it's done properly.

(00:30:52):
Search engine optimization is different in that the attribution can be tough. It's difficult to determine whether ultimately the actions that you took contributed to a rise in organic traffic. You have to essentially correlate that. And the reason is because when you build clusters of content and it's grouped thematically and you're targeting buckets of keywords, whether they're long tail or head keywords, whatever it may be, you can publish all of that on your website. Google still has to crawl it. They run it through their analysis algorithm, which is comprised of 200 different signals, of which maybe 20 to 30 have been publicly disclosed. So it's a bit of a black box.

(00:31:37):
We don't really know ultimately what ROI comes off of that unless you're very sophisticated, like probably one of your other guests, Ethan, in terms of measurement. Whereas paid, the ROI is still a difficult problem to solve, but there was a lot more of a linear relationship as it relates to attribution. And so paid being tangible was the reason why I leaned heavily into paid and ultimately away from SEO. But I do think that if you do SEO properly, the payoffs are indisputable and it is certainly an important part of a modern media mix.

Lenny (00:32:18):
You mentioned this earlier, I've heard this more and more recently that one of the biggest levers these days in paid growth is around creatives. It's not tooling or smarter data, or you tell me if I'm wrong, but it's just getting better creatives. And so I'll let you actually explain, what are creatives? There's a term creatives that people outside the industry don't really necessarily get. And then broadly, what should people be doing to optimize the way they approach creatives?

Jonathan Becker (00:32:46):
Certainly. So when we say creative, we're referring to the assets that power typically visual programmatic or pay per click campaigns on social channels or display networks. And so literally the motion graphics ad that you see on Facebook, the user generated content that you see on TikTok or a static ad that you might see that has a pretty picture in it or whatever. And so I think that when we talk about creative as a big lever around efficiency and optimization, the underlying conversation there is that over time our industry has been heavily automated. So a lot of the levers so to speak around performance have been automated by Google and Facebook over the last seven to 10 years. That's because originally when you ran these campaigns, you needed to have a rocket scientist in front of them. It was so complicated and there were so many different things that you could get wrong, and their solution, the channels like the big tech company solution to this is figuring it out for you. So eventually Google wants you to say, hey, I'm Google, give me your credit card and I'll take care of everything else. Facebook-

Lenny (00:33:57):
And the URL to point people to, and then we'll do the rest.

Jonathan Becker (00:34:00):
Yeah. I don't know if that's a great idea for consumers, by the way. But in the meantime, there's certain things that have just been fully automated. In the context of creative, it's still one of these things that for now is not auto-generated in the world of AI and all the changes that we're seeing. Maybe that's something that will change. But for now, essentially creative directors and their teams are concepting and producing different types of assets. And so there's a bunch of problems that we typically see when people come to us. So number one, performance marketing and brand marketing in a lot of organizations are two different things. And the designers that occupy brand teams bandwidth and whatnot often don't have a sense of how paid acquisition works.

(00:34:48):
And so one of the pitfalls of working with certain companies or the mistake that they make is the design team will hand off a file full of random assets for paid acquisition without any sense of how the channel works. And what I mean by that is these days we're using the analogy, the classic analogy of the funnel to organize our thinking around creative assets. So you can think about this as generating intent at the top of funnel and capturing intent at the bottom of the funnel. When I think about an experience that I want a consumer to have on Facebook, audience targeting and creative, I think about us beginning a conversation at the top of funnel creatively with an audience, having that conversation change as we say different things, and the audience that we're targeting ultimately graduates through different behaviors on our website from one to another, and then ultimately it resulting in an end to the conversation where they take an action hopefully that the brand that we're working with is looking for.

(00:35:56):
And so there's a clear beginning, middle and end to that. And one of the major pitfalls that we see is that certain brands just dump one homogenous message into all of their targeting. You see the same ad over and over again. It creates banner blindness and it's a total lack of efficiency. The antidote to that is to have resources dedicated to paid and essentially iterate upon the creative assets themselves based on the data that we see coming from ad sets and campaigns in various channels. And so what that means is that you have to experiment. You have to take a bit of a scientific approach, although it's a bit of an art and a bit of a science. You have to try and isolate variables, maintain similar conditions across targeting, and then determine which style and feature of an ad performs best at which stage of the funnel versus which audience. And the results that we see are dramatically different from brand to brand. But if you are not undertaking rigorous testing in conjunction with how you are driving the iteration and design of your ads, then you will not make progress essentially.

Lenny (00:37:11):
Is there a specific example that comes to mind here as something we did that just dramatically changed the impact of a change to a creative? Or if you can't think of one, are there just specific tactics that you can suggest for people to improve the way they approach creatives?

Jonathan Becker (00:37:28):
Yeah. So I think from a testing point of view, let's say I was running ads on Meta, beneath the campaign level when I create a campaign, the structure that my testing might take would be that I would have an audience, a single audience at the ad set level, and then I would have two nearly identical creatives within that ad set. The only thing being different across those two creative assets is a single variable. So it might be the copy, it might be an image or whatnot. That allows us to isolate a lot of variables and really test into one singular change across two creative assets. There's a lot of nuance to this. So sometimes the ad-serving algorithms, even when we set up a test structurally in that way, we'll serve one ad a different number of impressions than the other ad, in which case we then have to say, what is a leveling factor that allows us to look at these two ads equally, even though one received dramatically more impressions than the other?

(00:38:31):
This becomes where it becomes subjective in terms of how you want to determine success. But a good example is looking at the click-through rate, which is essentially a ratio or a metric like impressions until conversion, which is a leveling metric that allows us to determine, even though in a scenario where two ads facing the same audience within the same campaign received different numbers of impressions, we can still measure the efficiency or effectiveness of one ad over the other using metrics like that. And so from a testing point of view, I think that this is one way that we might look at trying to assess ad performance so that we can gather learnings, send that back to a creative team and say, hey, it turns out that when this copy is used at this stage of the funnel, it converts 50% more frequently than this other copy.

(00:39:26):
So let's now take that copy, use it as our base copy and challenge it with a different type of copy and see if we can continually iterate and refine. So that's a very practical example of how ad creative testing might work on a channel like Meta. You asked for specific examples where we've seen an unlock. There's two that come to mind. Several years ago we realized that highly produced ads from brand teams, and there's nothing wrong with brand teams, we work with them all the time. They do amazing work. I think we're just trying to work as a singular unit as opposed to being fragmented. But a lot of the brand guidelines of different companies would end up yielding these highly polished assets. And when you launch those on Instagram back in the day or something like that, what we found is that they would always underperform next to user generated assets.

(00:40:23):
So a brand that essentially has an influencer in front of it that says, I tried this product, I love it, I'm filming this ad from my iPhone. Look, check it out. Here's the product, here's me, I'm better off for it. Whatever it is that they're talking about. The unpolished iPhone, mobile phone creative, suddenly we realized massively outperformed these other channels because there was an authenticity to it. And rather than the brands themselves saying, hey, trust us, our product is great, here's a third party essentially validating what is so great about these brands, basically. So I can't speak to specific clients because I'm not allowed to talk about the work that we've done in large part, but that would be one example. And another example is we worked with a furniture company several years ago, which scaled dramatically, but they were having difficulty early on thinking through how to scale social ads.

(00:41:21):
And so paid search worked really well for them. Social ads, again, they had these highly produced styled rooms and one of the owners had their dog in the office all the time, and so they have these models sitting on furniture or whatever it was, and they would take these beautiful styled shots of their furniture in a room and one of the art directors was like, put the dog on the couch and let's take some photos of dogs on furniture, which made it more playful and approachable. That one change resulted in a total unlock of their performance on paid social channels. It would double or triple the ROAS that we were seeing type thing. So it's these minute differences that you can test into that ultimately can drive performance.

Lenny (00:42:04):
That reminds me of Airbnb. The photography team found, and actually the photography team was initially including people in the photos of listings, and that was the [inaudible 00:42:16] images of listing photos. And it turns out when there's no people in the listing photo, much higher conversion. And the theory basically people don't want to see other random strangers in a place they're going to sleep, and that was not expected.

Jonathan Becker (00:42:29):
That's a really great example. And so the question becomes, as a company and as a brand, do you arrive at those learnings anecdotally by accident? Is it the brilliance of one person on the team that the whole brand is predicated upon in terms of performance? Or do you put a very rigorous structure around testing and the iteration of assets and how to determine whether something works over another thing that is a process that yields the outcomes that you're looking for? And so a lot of times with agencies, people talk to us about the obvious hard skills that we have, but the soft skills are around process that can be deployed, that can actually be the difference between being highly sophisticated or unsophisticated. Internal teams do this too, but that Airbnb example is a great illustration of how if you put the right testing in place, you can yield an outcome that becomes an unlock for performance.

Lenny (00:43:28):
Getting even more tactical with that idea of testing a bunch of creatives makes me think about a story from chatting with a guy from Wish who's had a growth at Wish about how they uploaded hundreds of variations. And I think Wish is the epitome of the opposite of brand highly polished ads or it's just the most ridiculous looking product with just banners and numbers and prices and crossouts and all kinds of stuff, just anything that would take to get people to click. Is there a tool or process that you can point people to to help them do this testing on creatives or is it mostly built into the existing tools now and there's nothing really fancy about it?

Jonathan Becker (00:44:04):
We get asked this a lot and I think there are tools for different types of functions that we undertake in the process of running paid acquisition for different brands, but these days most of the testing that we do is within the channels themselves. So Meta ads, Google Ads, I keep touching on those two specifically because they're the most advanced in my opinion. They're really powerful. The good news here is that you don't necessarily need some exotic tool to do sophisticated creative testing. You can do it in platform and you can use the structure that I just kind of outlined as a starting point.

Lenny (00:44:43):
You mentioned Google and Facebook. What is your take on TikTok and YouTube and maybe Snap? Do you recommend people go there and there's a big opportunity? Do you think it's overblown? Do you think people should just take Google and Facebook basically at this point? What's your general advice?

Jonathan Becker (00:44:59):
So when I say Google and I say Facebook, I'm talking about the Google ecosystem of channels inclusive of YouTube. And when I talk about Facebook, I'm talking about Facebook, Instagram, and probably eventually WhatsApp, which I think will probably launch ads later this year. With all that said, some interesting opportunities these days really exist on channels like Amazon and TikTok as well as a number of other challenger channels I think. Snap I'll talk a little bit less about because I think really there's just fewer and fewer people potentially using Snap. There's no knock on Snap. I use Snap, I like it a lot, but at the same time, most individuals or organizations tend to want to place ads where there's a lot of views and engagement and the king of this right now is definitely TikTok. And so TikTok faces its own set of challenges and arguably there is as much an opportunity there as a barrier at the moment.

(00:45:58):
I love TikTok. I'm a consumer of content on TikTok, not a producer of content on TikTok. Their ads platform kind of reminds me of where Facebook ads was like six, seven years ago. It's not super sophisticated and attribution is not great yet, but you can get cheap CPCs because there's just fewer organizations advertising there. Fewer companies have figured out how to make that work. And same thing with Amazon. Amazon is a bit of a bespoke channel. It doesn't work for a B2B SaaS company. It's more specific to D2C I would say. But essentially those channels are wonderful. They're not at the point yet where they're kind of ubiquitous. Every single advertiser that has ever worked with us I think in the last 10 years is for sure on Google. Everybody does that. And then the question is, what else can I invest money in with the expectation of profitability?

(00:46:53):
And so TikTok and Amazon, and even if I want to break out YouTube, they tend to be a little bit more specific and they definitely work, but not for everybody yet. And so the question becomes, will TikTok become as prominent as a social ads platform like Meta Ads? And we just don't know yet. What we see working very nicely on TikTok, by the way, are these founder led brands where the founder is the ambassador and they're doing those handheld videos with their iPhone. They're talking about the merits of the products that they make. They're talking about the problems that they solve. They are great at cultivating a following. Their content is highly engaging. Those types of organizations crush it. Also, companies that got really good at partnering with influencers. So we haven't talked about partner marketing that much, but affiliate marketing companies got into this early, and then influencer marketing networks are all over this. But essentially having these third parties be an ambassador for your brand in an authentic way, partnering with them, having them generate the content. And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems...

Jonathan Becker (00:48:00):
... And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems to work quite well.

Lenny (00:48:05):
Awesome, I love those bullet points of just what is likely to work on TikTok.

Jonathan Becker (00:48:05):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:48:09):
Just broadly, would you say TikTok advertising today is underrated, overrated, or just right?

Jonathan Becker (00:48:16):
If you are e-comm based, if you're wholesale, retail based, anything direct to consumer, you have to investigate TikTok and try and figure out whether there's a way of promoting your products there, basically. It's a massive, highly engaged audience with somewhat specific demographics. It's a very exciting opportunity. Other brands need to pay attention to this and figure out what their entry point is going to be. And just because the innovation hasn't happened for B2B SaaS yet on TikTok doesn't mean it won't. TikTok wants that to happen, and so the question becomes how. And so someone will unlock that, and they'll make a billion dollars because of it.

(00:48:59):
But I wouldn't recommend that channel to everybody yet, and at Thrive for instance, we don't have a huge amount of people coming to us yet saying, "Hey, I'm spending $750,000 a month on TikTok, can you help me?" Type thing. The other problem with TikTok is that it's extraordinarily creative, asset dependent, and heavy. And so you are launching net new assets several times per week, it is hard for creative teams and brands to produce that much content. It takes a machine, and that's expensive, and so that all factors into the cost of not only just the ad dollars, but the creative resourcing and investment that's required to power that. So it can be done in a more nimble manner if you're spending less, but you can't really get to a million dollars a month on TikTok without having a huge amount of creative being pushed to that channel.

Lenny (00:49:56):
Awesome, that's really good advice. I want to chat out about AI soon, just because I imagine that could help with some of these things. But you mentioned B2B SaaS, and I wanted to ask, I imagine Google is the primary channel for B2B SaaS, and if not, or if it is, where else do you find there's value in spending money to drive growth through B2B SaaS, which channels and ad networks?

Jonathan Becker (00:50:20):
So I'm agnostic here in terms of where people should be spending money. I see this world in terms of impressions and clicks, and does that conform to the marketing economics of a project that needs to be achieved in order for it to grow. It's less about where to place your money and how to think about the placement of those funds. And so the common mistake that we see as people build out a funnel, so to speak, for B2B lead gen projects, or B2C lead gen projects, is they'll be overly reliant on the first of a sequence of metrics that ultimately yields a sale.

(00:50:57):
So typically it's something like cost per lead, marketing qualified lead, sales accepted lead, there might be a couple more metrics there, and then eventually a sale occurs. And so that the thinking is that, okay, for sales to occur, I need more leads at the top of the funnel. The more leads I have, the more marketing qualified leads I'll get, the more sales accepted leads get, and ultimately the more opportunities there will be and the more revenue will generate.

(00:51:24):
And so if I think about this world of lead generation on performance marketing platforms as a function of cost per lead in that sense that I just described, then the tendency is always to want to drive down the cost per lead, thinking that that's the efficiency, I can get more cheaper leads and that will yield more revenue. When in fact it turns out that if you flip that conversation on its head and say, not all opportunities and sales are equal, and instead of focusing upfront on a cost per lead, I now want to focus on what is a high value customer, so the cost per lead is actually higher, but the ROI of targeting those people is also higher. And so to get the higher quality leads, it's not a function of CPL.

(00:52:15):
And so that is a very common pitfall that we see when people come to us. The antidote to this, it's interesting, so Thrive developed an ETL tool, an extract transfer load tool called Thrive Stack. It's not commercially available, but if you wanted a commercially available version of this, you can use something called Supermetrics. Basically Supermetrics is a data connector. There's a world of different data connectors out there, but it allows you to pipe, via an API, revenue data from your CRM into a third party database that can then be joined with data from the channel itself. You can build tables within a database and normalize them together in a manner where you can start to determine the relationship between, again, the audience that a particular cohort of opportunities came from and whether a sufficient degree of revenue is derived from those opportunities.

(00:53:08):
And then you can build upon that what is known as a lead scoring model, which allows you to bid in real time on the audiences that have a higher likelihood to convert to high revenue generating customers. And so the magic there, we talked a little bit about rates of return and instant gratification in the performance marketing world, lead generation inherently is a slow gratification process. And so the problem is that if my pipeline is full of opportunities that yield revenue in two months, six months, sometimes 12 months, how do I determine how heavily to bid on different leads today in order to predictively have an outcome where I'm maximizing revenue? And a lead scoring model basically solves for that.

Lenny (00:53:59):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming.

(00:54:20):
And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming using sticky notes, reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, dry ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research, to product roadmaps, to customer journey flows, to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro. com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:55:06):
You talked about attribution, and I thought this would be a great time to get into that. So the way I think about this is oftentimes the biggest challenge in driving growth isn't the actual work you do to drive growth, it's measuring what impact your work is having and understanding where dollars are spent effectively. And things are changing heavily in attribution land with privacy shifts and ATT and iOS 14.5.1, or maybe whatever the version was that came out that changed everything. And so my question is, what changed, is one, in terms of being able to do attribution. Maybe even explain what attribution means for folks that are just like, what the hell are you even talking about? And then finally, just what do you recommend people do now to do attribution well in this new environment?

Jonathan Becker (00:55:57):
Yeah, it's a really, really great and pertinent question in the industry, and it has a lot of focus on it now, but attribution has always been a conversation that's been very important. So just to kick things off, attribution essentially is how we determine the relationship between what we did and what happened. In the context of performance marketing this means what ads did we serve, what campaigns did we launch, and generally what was the revenue ultimately that was derived from these campaigns? And so there's a funny quote that I love, someone named John Wanamaker in 1919 said, "I know-"

Lenny (00:56:33):
I bet I'm going to guess what it is.

Jonathan Becker (00:56:34):
Do you want to guess?

Lenny (00:56:35):
It's, "Half my marketing dollars are wasted, I just don't know which half."

Jonathan Becker (00:56:41):
Exactly, I love that you knew that. He said this in 1919. The world was a very different place there, but oddly enough we still have these types of problems today and it's because the world of what I did and what happened because of what I did is very complicated. There's so many variables, some of which we know, and then some of which we don't know that we don't know, type thing. And so attribution, as it stands in our industry, is still an incredibly subjective art and somewhat of a science. It doesn't mean that it's impossible, and it doesn't mean that there aren't varying degrees of sophistication as it relates to attribution, but we're still in a place where we have to understand the business and its goals, and then start to work on an attribution model.

(00:57:32):
An attribution model is probably something that is never solved, but I'll give you a couple of examples. So number one around attribution, it's important to determine whether an organization, a company, a client, is focused on profitability or growth. Whether I use one attribution lens or another will drive those outcomes. And so these days, for a number of different reasons, you mentioned iOS 14.5, in addition to third party cookie deprecation, and whatnot.

(00:58:02):
There's no one way necessarily of approaching attribution. The most classic and commonly held version of attribution used to be a cookie-based form of attribution called last click attribution, meaning that the last click in the sequence of clicks that yielded a conversion would be attributed with all the revenue from that conversion. Other models in a cookie-based world involved first touch attribution, so it's actually the first click. So I launch an ad, it's in an audience that doesn't know about my service or my brand, and so the first click that I get should be given all the credit for that sale. And then there's multi-touch attribution, which can take several different forms, but essentially is saying it's not one way or the other of the two first versus last click options, it's somewhere in between. So I'm going to create a weighted attribution model where the first touch gets so much of the credit and the last touch gets so much of the credit.

(00:58:59):
This is very subjective, as you can see. I am essentially looking at my business model, determining what my goals are, and then I'm backing out into an attribution methodology that I think adheres to both the economics of my business and the capabilities of these platforms. And again, we live in a world where a single brand might do television advertising, they might buy media in magazines, they might buy billboards, they might get impressions from Facebook, they might do paid search, so there's a big argument over how to ultimately model this.

(00:59:34):
So there was something called an IDFA that Apple allowed advertisers to use, and essentially what that was, it literally means ID for advertisers, and it allowed Facebook, Google, and other advertisers, Snap, TikTok, whoever was essentially selling ads that were predicated on being displayed on a Apple mobile device or a desktop device, it allowed the advertiser to provide attribution metrics and certain types of customer match metric metrics in their own platforms. And so when Apple ultimately launches its privacy changes, I believe in mid-2021, overnight it allows users to say, "Well, I don't want to share that information, I'm not going to share my IDFA anymore." Or, "Yes, I do want to share my IDFA." And so what you see as a result of that is less of the core data that Facebook in particular would've required to make attribution more airtight and ultimately validate its advertising.

(01:00:43):
So because we can no longer validate attribution on Facebook as seamlessly, we are in a situation where we're not sure any longer which audiences to target, and we're not sure how to run all of our creative testing, and ultimately we can't even determine the degree of revenue that's coming from particular campaigns that we've launched, and whatnot. And so it created quite a stir in the world of attribution, which is obviously this core discussion to is it working or not? People want to answer John Wanamaker's question, but the modern methodology now is through a number of different approaches to validation.

(01:01:25):
So the cookie based attribution, which had been probably the most popular version of attribution in the 2010s, really up to this point, is now one of the ways that we would look at this, but we would also include things like various forms of statistical modeling, customer surveys, population surveys, there's a number of different ways to the same place here. Statistical modeling, by the way, one thing that's very popular these days, which I think was originally created in the 1950s, is a form of statistical modeling called media mix modeling. It's essentially regression analysis, and it is trying to determine the causal relationship between, again, what you did and what the effect was on revenue. That's very topical in the industry these days. If you're looking for a tool off the shelf that can help with this, Recast is something that I see people using. But a lot of organizations build these highly customized bespoke models that ultimately feed the algorithm inside of an MMM model in a customized manner.

Lenny (01:02:27):
What is it, or is there a recommendation of just like, hey, if you're trying to do attribution today, here's what you should do. Is there a clear, do this, piece of advice, or is it super personalized depending on what you're trying to do?

Jonathan Becker (01:02:42):
The advice is that there's no single source of truth. Anyone who claims that they are a single source of truth, whether it's an individual, a model that they've created, or a tool that they've created, is not being accurate. I believe that the approach that works to attribution is that it's an ongoing investigation and it never stops, and essentially what you're doing is looking for evidence that validates the outcome of your performance marketing campaigns one way or the other.

(01:03:12):
There have been plenty of incredibly sophisticated attribution models that we've helped build and invalidated with MMM or other types of tools that have indicated that the campaigns do not work. So I will repeat that, we, a very sophisticated organization, have stood up campaigns that we measure and ultimately determine do not work, and that is an important finding in terms of an organization's determination of whether they want to continually invest, take budget out of these channels, or invest into other areas.

Lenny (01:03:49):
Awesome. You mentioned a company called Recast. I don't think you knew this, but I'm actually an investor, and so obviously a big fan, so check it out. I don't know what the site is, recast.com maybe. I think if you Google Recast attribution, we'll also have a link in the show notes.

Jonathan Becker (01:04:02):
Cool. Yeah, they're working with a couple of our clients right now and it's interesting, I like their approach.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Yeah, they're basically, they're building the model as a SaaS tool to do attribution in a really clever way. Amazing. Okay, just a couple more questions, one is around AI, one is around agencies, and just how to start down this road. How has AI in any way impacted the work you're doing today, or the work of paid growth, performance marketing, and then where do you think this will go in the next few years?

Jonathan Becker (01:04:29):
Interestingly, and I think I alluded to this earlier, but our industry has been influenced by AI for over a decade. So Google, Facebook, even Microsoft, these are some of the organizations that historically have been at the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence, and their goal was always to automate as much as possible within these platforms. And so the effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. So we're actually, we have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic, it's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers, like some of the things that we've talked about, and less so the trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.

(01:05:19):
So I think if we are the canary in the coal mine for other industries, what will be interesting is I assume that if you work in an architecture office that you'll be doing less of the drafting, and it's already been a change that's occurred in those offices, but you'll be doing less of the drafting and more of this strategic problem solving around what kind of building is necessary for the client in this scenario, type thing.

(01:05:42):
And so on a practical level, though, some of these conversational AI models are very interesting for us in that when I think about creative testing, for instance, we can have ChatGPT come up with all kinds of variants of copy that we would not have necessarily thought of. It can do a lot of drafting of things like RFP responses, so we can feed ChatGPT 100 previous RFP responses that we've done and have it spit out net new responses to net new questions in a net new RFP, and it's like 80% good and still requires 10 hours of work to massage to the point where we can send it off to a client, but that replaces a week of work with five or six people that it would've previously taken.

Lenny (01:06:33):
And that's already happening today, you're saying?

Jonathan Becker (01:06:35):
That's happening now, literally right now, type thing, all of what I just said. And there's a lot of different ways that we are beginning to use AI to do more with less, basically. So that's how I see it influencing not just our industry, but other people's businesses as well.

Lenny (01:06:55):
That's amazing. So just to repeat what you said, your team now, because of ChatGPT is able to spend more time higher level, and leverage specifically ChatGPT to do this kind of, and RFPs are basically proposals, people are asking you to pitch to work with them, is that?

Jonathan Becker (01:06:55):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:12):
Okay, yeah.

Jonathan Becker (01:07:13):
Some of these AI-driven organizations that allow you to type in a prompt and it spits out an image, on our creative group we can come up with mockups in literally 1% of the time that it took. So you no longer have to draw the initial mockups for art. Suddenly what might have taken one person a week of work on a campaign takes an afternoon, type thing. You still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, "Do we like this more or do we like this more?" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.

Lenny (01:07:55):
What's the tool your team uses for that, is it MidJourney or Dall-E or something else?

Jonathan Becker (01:08:00):
It's Dall-E and it's MidJourney, so you got it.

Lenny (01:08:03):
Got it. And so what you use it for is you're thinking about a concept and you just come up with a mock, coming up with a prompt to pitch what this could be.

Jonathan Becker (01:08:11):
Yeah, the interesting thing there is that these concepts often live inside of someone's head, and we do this thing as humans where we verbally discuss it, and I try and put the image in my mind's eye, in your mind's eye, which is an inherently inefficient process and actually hurts our ability to be creative leaders. Someone might just see it slightly differently than you do. Now that person theoretically can use Dall-E to output what is inside their head, and they can refine that easily through subsequent prompts in Dall-E or MidJourney, or whatever it may be, and then just say, "Do you like this? This is my idea." And so in a way it's helped humans connect more easily in that context than we were capable of doing before, and then in the context of pitching a client on ideas, we are capable of generating more ideas faster and iterating upon them live. So I can have a Zoom call with you, I can present my screen, and if you don't like the output of Dall-E that I just prompted, I can re-prompt based on your feedback in real time.

Lenny (01:09:16):
There's this sentiment that AIs going to take away the fun stuff of jobs, like maybe being creative and coming up with a new concept and photography, setting up a whole photo shoot, whatever.

Jonathan Becker (01:09:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:30):
Do you find that your team is excited about uploading this to Dall-E, or are they just like, goddammit, this is what I loved, and now I'm just sitting around in docs writing prompts.

Jonathan Becker (01:09:40):
I am not an incredible artist, but now I can take those thoughts in my mind and output them just as well as someone who's pretty skilled in artwork. So in a sense, I'm excited because this technology democratizes the ability to do this across everyone. Anyone who can think a thought can generate an image on an AI image generator. How many scribes do you know?

Lenny (01:10:04):
Zero, I believe zero.

Jonathan Becker (01:10:06):
Because we invented something called the printing press, and the printing press took over what was a cottage industry for very specific individuals that allowed them to control the flow of information. Yet today it's not like we have fewer writers or creative thinkers, they're just using different tools to arrive at the same place. You could say the same thing of the loom. There used to be people who would stitch your T-shirt together, or your sweater together, and none of those people have work anymore. There's still people who knit, I suppose. But your clothes are made in factories with machines, and the quality of the clothing is arguably a lot better than it was, maybe I'm wrong about that point, but you can make more of it and more sophisticated clothing.

(01:10:46):
There's no question that AI is going to displace and replace certain industries of people, certain roles. I'm not going to pretend like I know whether that's a good or bad thing, and I'm also not a poster child for AI, I am really just using the technology that's available to us to run our business the best way we can. We haven't let anybody go yet because of these efficiencies. The people who used to do the artwork are the ones using these tools, and I think they're excited that they're more productive. Is there going to be nuance around that? Of course. Are some people going to be sad about the changes? Yes. I think human nature is that people generally don't like change, but I think over time we've seen change has been a productive and positive thing for society, not a negative thing.

Lenny (01:11:35):
Awesome. Yeah, so it sounds like the team is excited, generally, and that's a good sign, and that's what I find generally. I think some people will be really upset, but most people will be like, amazing, and they never wanted to do this part.

Jonathan Becker (01:11:47):
This generation of people will be upset, and then there will be a subsequent generation that never knew anything different. So the way that I think about this is the people growing up these days have always had the internet, whereas you and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI-

Jonathan Becker (01:12:00):
You and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI is a platform like the internet and just as when the internet was launched, you couldn't conceive of amazon.com or all of these wonderful or social networks or whatever it was. The permutations of what AI will become, even in the current GPT 4 context or Dolly context or whatever it may be. We don't know what people are going to create with this and so it's difficult for the generation that knew what life was like beforehand, before iPhone, before internet, before AI, but there will be people who know nothing but this eventually, and to them it'll just be normal.

Lenny (01:12:42):
Until we're all just replaced by AI and then it's AI writing ads to get other AI tools to buy products from each other.

Jonathan Becker (01:12:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:12:49):
And then we're just sitting around watching Netflix and that'll be great. There's always this question when you're starting to invest in paid growth, performance marketing of should we work at an agency? Should we work? Should we hire someone junior to figure it out? Should we hire someone senior?

Jonathan Becker (01:13:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:13:03):
What's your general advice for, say, an early stage startup when it makes sense to work with an agency versus bringing someone in-house?

Jonathan Becker (01:13:12):
Mm-hmm. We need people in-house to do our jobs properly. Agencies are not mutually exclusive to personnel in-house. If we don't have a point of contact, for instance, at an earlier stage company and we're supposed to report to the CEO, CEOs tend to be very busy people and we often just can't get the information and approvals that we need to be successful. If you think that growth marketing is an opportunity and that performance marketing is a subset of growth marketing that you want some focus on, the reality is you're going to need expertise and you probably should start in-house and then hire an agency.

(01:13:49):
Again, there's different stages of companies and different examples of what makes sense at different stages and the nature of the work that we do at different stages changes. Very, very late stage, we're kind of doing a lot of this sophisticated production work. We're implementing sophisticated testing, we're working on attribution, we're building beautiful reporting, but in a sense, we're maintaining this machine that already exists. Earlier stage, we're doing a lot more of net new experimentation, trying to discover what is working and what sequence of audience targeting versus creative asset display will work, what channel mix works, and all of that. A lot of times the body of work that's required to nail that and the inputs to literally out front what questions to be asking isn't something that a small in-house team possesses and so they will work with an agency to scale faster, to get where they're going quicker, to bring in more resources quickly, basically. Then later stage, sometimes it's a permutation of the same thing or we're really just managing a whole bunch of different capabilities that they have because it's very complicated and difficult to staff.

Lenny (01:15:05):
That is really interesting. So it's not like agency versus in-house full-time person. It's you need both is what you're finding.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:11):
I don't think we have any projects that we're working on where there's not a professional marketing person as our POC and generally the people that we report to have a background in what we do, whether they ended up doing something different and now they're a VP or a director level and not directly managing channels themselves is one thing or another. But yeah, we work with people that have in-house expertise all day long.

Lenny (01:15:35):
I see. Sometimes it could just be a generalist marketing person that becomes your point of contact.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:15:39):
They don't have to be experienced in paper.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:41):
There's one more thing. As agencies, we're constantly solving people's problems in the market and as a result of that, I have a fairly large team of 130 people that think about performance marketing all day long. It's the first thing we think about when we have our morning coffee and it's the last thing we think about as we're leaving the office kind of thing. We have very sophisticated and built out capabilities as well as all kinds of software and processes and capabilities, I guess, that we've created that most in-house teams just don't have because they're smaller or newer or someone might be really sophisticated but they don't have the resources to implement it and stuff. In the same way that a really sophisticated organization might go to Boston Consulting Group or McKenzie to say, "Hey, we did this, but you do more of this all day long and we need advice on how to be more efficient," people come to Thrive saying, "Hey, we're top of our game. We have really strong people. They absolutely know what they're doing," which is always the case by the way, "But we're looking for extra sophistication and additional capabilities that are very difficult to create in an in-house organization." It's why we worked with Uber for 10 years. It was tough to replace us.

Lenny (01:16:59):
Yeah, that's quite the retention. 10 years, 10 years going, I imagine our net dollar retention has gone up too.

Jonathan Becker (01:17:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:17:09):
When you're looking to hire someone full-time to drive the paid growth channel and/or work with an agency, what do you recommend people look for specifically, especially things maybe they're not likely to think about when they're hiring someone that people often miss?

Jonathan Becker (01:17:26):
There's a couple of competencies that I think are very important. I found that, so I was a nerd as a child, if you can't tell, I don't know.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Nope.

Jonathan Becker (01:17:35):
Super nerdy, geeky kid. I would take apart-

Lenny (01:17:38):
[inaudible 01:17:38].

Jonathan Becker (01:17:39):
I would take apart my parents' computers, I'd try and rebuild them. I was fooling around with bulletin boards before websites existed, stuff like that. Then I became a web developer and as I transitioned into a performance marketing role, I realized that being technical and having technical aptitudes was extraordinarily helpful in terms of being on the front line of what we were doing and solving problems. If you're making your first hire, you probably want them to have the ingenuity and capability to solve a lot of the problems that you're going to run into within the context of tracking, attribution, data visualization, and then campaign management. Number one, do they have a technical background? That can be multidisciplinary.

(01:18:22):
At Thrive, we have someone who is a nuclear physicist that left discipline and became a performance marketer. We have people who have left mathematics and become performance marketers, people who left finance, full stack engineering, all kinds of stuff. Those are technical fields where people tend to be good at math and good at problem solving, and so that's a strong piece of evidence that they might have a strong aptitude for performance marketing and managing this.

(01:18:52):
Another thing is just literally do they have experience in this discipline? Have they managed on any level Meta ads, Google ads, TikTok, Amazon, some of the things we talked about? Do they have an appreciation for some of the inputs that we just discussed today that ultimately create the conditions for success within a performance marketing environment? Do they understand the role of creative? Do they understand the role of proper attribution and are they capable of understanding the mechanics of your business and so on and so forth?

(01:19:29):
I would say just fundamentally, those are some of the areas that when we are interviewing we're looking for. As an agency too, we are looking for the ability to work with people and be excellent at client services. One of the questions we might ask, I actually borrowed a Jeff Bezos question from early stage Amazon where I asked people without much warning in an interview, I'll ask them whether it's okay to do a bit of a thought experiment together and whether they are comfortable responding to a logic question. I'll ask the question of, "How many windows are there in New York City?" There's two things that I look for in this scenario. One is can they think on their feet? I'm not actually looking for the correct answer. It's a pretty difficult question to solve. But number one, do you realize that windows are not just building windows and windows are also in cars and trucks and stuff like that, so there's more than one type of window. Then can you just do the arithmetic of saying there's so many buildings per hectare or square mile or whatever it is and it's division multiplication type stuff.

(01:20:33):
But also from a client services point of view, I'm trying to see whether in a scenario where I've asked them something that they obviously probably weren't prepared for, that is a strange thing to ask and probably makes them feel a little bit uncomfortable, how they react in that situation. Do they remain composed or do they lose their composure and get frustrated or even angry that I asked them something that's pretty weird to ask? Their reaction there is often a good leading indicator of whether or not in a client scenario working with our clients, they can compose themselves in a difficult situation.

Lenny (01:21:10):
Very tactically, what level of experience do you recommend people look for in their first performance marketing hire year or two, four or five years, longer?

Jonathan Becker (01:21:23):
I've seen people who have 10 years of experience in the industry not be that great and then I've seen people who have one year of experience be absolutely phenomenal. I would say that again, the years of service under their belt is one clue or piece of evidence to their potential aptitude. But really, you want someone who can clearly demonstrate to you that they can competently run the channels I suppose. If what you're asking is literally at the level where someone is managing pay per click and programmatic media buying, then you want to make sure that they can just do that and I would say it's less about the years of experience. A lot of times people only want to do those types of jobs for a couple years before they're like, "Hey, what's your plan for me? I'm tired of running ads and building campaigns. I want to manage the people who do that now." The people who tend to really do that are often somewhat earlier on in their careers. That's just a reality that we see.

Lenny (01:22:25):
One more very technical question. What do you recommend the title for this role be? Growth marketer, something else?

Jonathan Becker (01:22:31):
I've seen so many different names for this. I think again, if the intention is to grow out a growth marketing capability, which again is not exclusive to performance marketing, then you're looking for a manager role of growth marketing manager. I've seen paid acquisition specialist for people who just manage channels. I've seen paid acquisition manager, performance marketing manager, media planner and buyer. I've seen all kinds of different roles. But when we are launching a new role these days, there's such wonderful tools like everything from Glassdoor to LinkedIn to PayScale where you can essentially just look at what other people are calling it and borrow from their role descriptions and then create your own role description and then determine what role is meaningful in the context of your own organization.

Lenny (01:23:23):
Awesome. Last question. We started with the story of how you landed Uber, and I know you also have an interesting story which I haven't heard of how you landed Snap/Snapchat as a client, so maybe tell that story.

Jonathan Becker (01:23:38):
It's a fun story and I think it's about ultimately confidence and knowing your craft. I believe it was like 2015 or 2016, we were essentially contacted to participate in an RFP down in Los Angeles. RFPs are difficult processes and essentially a department of a company is saying, "We want performance marketing and here are all the questions that we're going to ask you and exercises you need to complete in order to vet you as to whether you are the right partner or not." Sometimes RFPs are incredibly thoughtful and they're run by people who have either done a lot of RFPs in the context of what we do or they know specifically what the outcome is. Then in other cases, they're very experienced marketing departments with senior people and an approach that they may take is every stakeholder within that department gets to submit one or two questions to a long list of questions and the respondents have to respond to all of this.

(01:24:38):
The RFP process for Snap was somewhat complex and they asked a range of different questions and we find ourselves in LA at a hotel the night before, it's 2:00 in the morning, my business partner and another team member that we had brought down are sweating and we're like, "How are we going to build a presentation out of this? They're asking so many well-meaning but difficult questions that are zigging and zagging." In a pitch situation you want to tell a story, it's important, and that story has to have a beginning, middle, and end. It was just difficult and yet here we were and we had worked with all these really cool organizations and I was very confident that we knew precisely what we were doing. I kind of had this eureka moment where I was like, "Here's what we're going to do." It was Brent MacArthur, my business partner and I kind of arrived at this together, but we're kind of like, "Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have a completely unique take on how to respond to this and we're going to build a deck that's bespoke around X, Y, and Z."

(01:25:54):
We work till 6:00 in the morning, I think we get a couple hours of sleep and then by 10:00, we're sitting in their offices. Essentially the pitch is something like this. I stand there in front of about 20 different executives from their organization and I say, "You have thoughtfully curated an RFP for us to respond to today, and you have asked us to respond to about 20 to 30 different questions. With the utmost respect, I am not going to answer any of your questions today. I'm standing here because you are looking for a marketing partner and you need expertise in this area and instead of telling you the answers to the questions that you asked, I'm going to tell you what I think you need to do to get where you want to go and if you agree with me and my logic and what I talk to you about here today, then you should hire us. If you do not agree with my logic and you think that we're out to lunch, then you should not hire us."

(01:26:47):
You could hear a pin drop in the room. My own team I think was a little bit surprised. We had a whole bunch of technical difficulties that day. Someone who was supposed to Zoom in couldn't make it and so I have to ad lib part of the pitch that I wasn't prepared for, lots of zig and zags. They thank us for RFP response, lots of handshakes and smiling faces, but we don't know whether we're going to land the client or not.

(01:27:12):
Then about two hours later, I was driving to San Francisco with a friend, immediately leave LA for SF because I had a bunch of follow on meetings, and I get a phone call and they were like, "We loved your approach. Congratulations. You're hired."

(01:27:28):
These days I think Snap is still a really interesting organization, but at the time they were kind of bringing the future of a social platform or what a social platform could be in the same way that we think about TikTok right now. TikTok wasn't on the scene yet and Facebook was very worried about Snap and there was tons of engagement on Snap, so this was the it client of the day and it felt amazing.

(01:27:55):
Essentially the lesson was that you have to trust yourself and understand your strengths and weaknesses. In situations where someone is well-meaning but may not understand what they need, be brave and tell them what they need rather than just conforming to what they're asking for because sometimes inadvertently that leads you down the wrong path. We took a big risk and it had a wonderful payoff and we have, in addition to this story, we had a wonderful relationship with them for a couple years.

Lenny (01:28:28):
I love that story. I love how dramatic all your new customers, your way of acquiring customers and I imagine not all of them are this dramatic.

Jonathan Becker (01:28:38):
Not all of them are this dramatic, but there have been some pretty dramatic ones. I think part of running a business and running an agency has been the curation and experience around all these fun, crazy stories that have accumulated as we run this really interesting services business.

Lenny (01:28:55):
Awesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for the lightning round?

Jonathan Becker (01:29:03):
I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:29:05):
Okay, great Looking, very excited. Okay, first question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jonathan Becker (01:29:13):
As a marketer, Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks is a wonderful book. He is a world world-class storyteller. I don't know if you know him. He wrote this book about how to structure and think about the art of storytelling and every marketer should read Storyworthy. It was a huge contributor to how I think about what we do at Thrive. As an entrepreneur, I love startup stories, so Shoe Dog, which is the startup story of Nike. It's basically Phil Knight talking about all the ups and downs, and it's crazy. Nike shouldn't be a company based on all the turmoil and challenges that they overcame. Fascinating read about taking risk and doing what you think is right and ultimately succeeding and building Nike. Then a book by Nick Bilton called American Kingpin, which is the story of the startup of the Silk Road, which was like this dark web marketplace for some pretty bad stuff. But it is half tech story, startup story and half gangster kind of kingpin story. It honestly should be a Hollywood movie. It reads like a Hollywood thriller. So awesome, great book.

Lenny (01:30:30):
Favorite recent movie or a TV show.

Jonathan Becker (01:30:32):
I don't know how recent it is, but I love The Big Short, just love it.

Lenny (01:30:35):
Not recent at all, but it's still great.

Jonathan Becker (01:30:37):
It's still great. The reason why I like it is because someone found truth in the data they were analyzing and then capitalized on it, which is really an analog for what we do in performance marketing. Then recently I have fallen in love with White Lotus for no particular reason. It's just raw entertainment.

Lenny (01:30:54):
What's something you've changed in the way that you all operate that's been relatively minor in terms of how hard it was to change, but that had a tremendous impact on your ability to execute as a team or a company?

Jonathan Becker (01:31:08):
The tools that we use in performance marketing change constantly. The channels themselves change and therefore what problems exist and what SaaS companies or different types of platforms offer as solutions to problems change. I don't think it's one thing necessarily, this might be a bit of a roundabout answer here, but I mentioned that change itself earlier is something that humans seem to not love, whereas in our industry, and I don't think we're alone here, but there's a culture of change. A welcoming of change, aptitude around change, having a playful mindset with new technology and tools rather than being upset about the fact that AI exists or third party cookies are being deprecated or iOS 14 removed IDFA and trying to be creative around those types of solutions has been like a constant for us. I'm kind of sidestepping the question a little bit, but it is the cultural willingness to adapt that I think has been a strong suit for us as a company.

Lenny (01:32:12):
Speaking of tools, final question. What is your favorite most underrated tool for performance marketing work?

Jonathan Becker (01:32:18):
It's Thrive Stack. It's a tool that we built in-house that allows us to pipe third party data and anonymized customer level data into a database and then ultimately visualize it in a format like Data Studio, Google Data Studio, which I think now is called Looker Studio. That has been a profoundly powerful platform from which we're capable of delivering insights that are built upon the data as opposed to just regurgitated data, if that makes sense. We have not released this technology yet. It's basically a tool we use in-house with our clients. But to a certain extent, I mentioned Supermetrics, which is another ETL and has some of the same capabilities but isn't quite as powerful.

Lenny (01:33:05):
Amazing. Jonathan, this is by far the deepest I've ever gone into the world of paid growth. I really appreciate you making time and sharing all of your wisdom with us. Two final questions.

# Competing with giants: An inside look at how The Browser Company builds product | Josh Miller (CEO)

## Transcript

Josh Miller (00:00:00):
We want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details. For other people, it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering headcount. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you get it. You give them a very exciting, ambitious product and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Josh Miller. Josh is the CEO and co-founder of a company called The Browser Company, which makes a product called Arc, which has quickly become my default web browser. I fell in love with this product as soon as I started using it and wanted to get a glimpse into how Josh and his team approached the craft of product. There's this cohort of companies like the Browser Company, [inaudible 00:01:09], a few others that are just laser focused on building the best possible user experience, almost above all else. And I wanted to spend some time exploring this trend with Josh. We cover how he thinks about prioritization, team building, storytelling, company values, metrics, shipping, building in public so much more.

(00:01:28):
Josh is such an earnest, genuine and humble human, and it was such a pleasure getting to learn from him. And, just to be clear, I'm not an investor in the Browser Company and I barely knew anything about the company before I chatted with Josh. So, I'm just a fan. And as a special surprise, Arc is normally invite only. But if you're listening to this now, check the show notes for a special link that'll get you right in to use the browser, if you want to play with it yourself. With that, I bring you Josh Miller after a short word from our select sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:57):
Josh, welcome to the podcast.

Josh Miller (00:03:59):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:00):
It's absolutely my pleasure. You are the CEO and co-founder of The Browser Company, which builds a product called Arc. Can you just talk about what is The Browser Company? What is Arc? And then whatever you can share about just like the scale of Arc at this point. That'd be really interesting to hear.

Josh Miller (00:04:15):
Sure. I hope you don't mind me doing this. I'm curious, I hear that you may, may or may not use Arc? How would you describe Arc to somebody?

Lenny (00:04:25):
The simple explanation is it's just the best web browser that I've used. So, to me it's a browser. I know that you have a bigger vision than that, but that's the way I see it as a layperson who hasn't seen the full vision.

Josh Miller (00:04:38):
Awesome. I think we can go home now. That's great. That's awesome.

Lenny (00:04:39):
There we go.

Josh Miller (00:04:39):
No. To be totally honest with you and your listeners, we have a really hard time describing Arc, which is something I'm not proud of. But it is, objectively, a replacement for your default web browser. And people who try it seem to really love it, and most people seem to have a hard time using the internet in the old way. So, that may sound like I'm being coy, but we have work shopped many a one-liners and the words have escaped us so far. So, to be honest, it is on our to-do list to get sharper about that.

(00:05:15):
And then in terms of our scale, since we have a lot of product managers listening, I'll give you the PM answer to that question, which is, we really focus on one key metric as it relates to tracking our growth or how we are doing. We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric. You can't game it. Right? So from retention perspective, it's not just opening it accidentally once a week. You need to open a tab on a day in order to count as an active for a day.

(00:06:01):
But so it tracks retention. It tracks engagement because five days a week is no joke. There are very few apps or pieces of software you actively use five days a week. And then, obviously, it tracks growth, because of we track the count. So that is what we track. And then we also don't obsess over absolute numbers, because if we're successful, if you zoom out and out and out, any point in time will be inconsequential and small. So, what we really look is growth rate week over week. So, relative to last week, what is our growth rate? And for the past eight months or so, we've been growing over 10% every single week. So very, very thrilled with that. Do not think that will continue If anyone is listening. I would be shocked if we continue like that for another eight months. But, yeah. We obsess over how many humans use Arc five out of seven days a week. And we really want that number to grow as fast as possible every single week.

Lenny (00:06:54):
I love that we're already talking about metrics and retention. This is off to a good start.

Josh Miller (00:06:57):
You got to know your audience. Lenny.

Lenny (00:06:59):
We're going to talk about just how public you're about everything. But would you be for sharing your retention actual numbers? The D5 and D7 you just mentioned?

Josh Miller (00:07:07):
Yes. With the asterisk that I didn't prepare for that. So, Rebecca correct me on Twitter after this, if this is wrong. So once again, we don't look at DAU retention. We don't look at weekly active-user retention. We really just look at D5 D7 retention. Depending on the cohort, that's somewhere between low to mid-30s and low 40s. So really, really fantastic. Again, not going to continue. If there is anyone on this call that is going to check this in a year, it will be lower I'm sure. But so far, we're really thrilled with it.

(00:07:37):
And most importantly, in the same way, we don't look at absolute gross growth number, we don't look at retention in this moment. We look at, is it improving cohort by cohort? And so, what I think I am most proud of is that, if you go back a year, by all means our retention curve, we were really proud of it. And I think one of the best in our category of software. But, what I'm really proud of is, 12 months later we've been inching it up and up and up, despite getting further away from the earliest most passionate adopters. So, our retention curve's going up and up a little bit, which is-

Lenny (00:08:11):
All right. All right. If you haven't shared that, that'd be cool to share on Twitter someday. I'm a retained user.

Josh Miller (00:08:15):
I'm going to wait and you can share this clip. We'll share this clip.

Lenny (00:08:18):
Okay. Okay. I love it. We're just ready. We got the marketing strategy coming together. So, I told you this ahead of the chat, but the reason I wanted to have you on this podcast, even though, as folks may know, and as I've told you, I try to actually avoid founders and CEOs on this podcast to give other folks a platform who aren't often invited on podcasts. But the reason I wanted to have you on is, I just feel like Arc is a remarkable product. It blew me away the first time I used it. I don't know if you saw it, I tweeted as soon as I signed up? I had to share how awesome it was. I was like-

Josh Miller (00:08:47):
Of course I saw it. It made my day.

Lenny (00:08:48):
Okay. Okay, great. And, also as an outside observer, it just feels like you're building remarkable culture and team that's really unique. And, so I just want to selfishly learn from how you think about product and team building and all the things that go into it. So yeah.

Josh Miller (00:09:03):
Thanks for saying that, Lenny. What a cool way to kick off an interview.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Absolutely. First question I have along those lines is, you mentioned at some point that your product building philosophy is a reaction to the traditional Silicon Valley way of building product. I'm curious to hear what led you down that road? Why did you feel like you had to react to it? And then how would you just describe your product building philosophy at The Browser Company?

Josh Miller (00:09:27):
I'll share this caveat once and never again in this interview. But I want anyone listening to know, I'm someone who doesn't believe there is a single right way to do things. So, what I'm sharing today is truly just what we have found works for us in this moment for what we are doing. But, I remember when I was earlier in my career, I'd listen to podcasts like this and take it as dogma, because there are these people that had done it and I respected what they'd built. So, if any of this sounds like "better than thou," it's not intended to. This is just what we found works for us and what we care about. [inaudible 00:09:59].

(00:09:58):
Okay. So early in my career started a company also with Hursh, my current co-founder and CTO. We were fortunate enough to have that company acquired or acqui-hired by Facebook and spent a number of years working at Facebook. And remarkable organization, probably the best executing I've ever seen at that period of time. And, by the way, I'd never been a PM before, so I'm not complimenting myself, I was just learning for the first time. But what struck me at Facebook in call it 2014, and I've seen through to this day, is Silicon Valley, at least the most modern version of Silicon Valley, has this obsession with graphs, and has this obsession with numbers and metrics.

(00:10:36):
I mean, you saw me in the previous answer, I'm talking about D5, D7. What's a D5, D7? And, it is an incredibly effective way to achieve certain outcomes, to focus on numbers, because it's very quantitative, it's objective. You can see the graph go up or go down, or stay flat depending on what you want. But what we've found is that optimizing for metrics leaves a lot on the table and it misses a lot. And so, what we do at The Browser Company is we talk about optimizing feelings. How do we want to make someone feel on the other end of our software? Do we want to make them feel joy? Do we want to make them feel fast? Do we want to make them feel organized? Do we want to make them feel focused? What is it the feeling we are trying to evoke in whatever we're doing on a specific project, or a specific feature, or a specific piece of storytelling content?

(00:11:31):
And I can imagine what's going through the heads of your listeners right now, which is probably a number of things. But among others, that sounds really damn romantic. If they're like, "Okay. You optimizing for feelings." But if you allow me, I would posit that actually this modern way of optimizing for numbers and graphs, especially for what we all do every day, which is make things and put in the world, is what's fairly odd. Because, if you just to yourself daydream about, what are your favorite products or product companies and brands, while it may sound cliche for me, Nike. Nike was one of the first companies that at a very deep level resonate with me as a child. Disney? Disney, same thing. Apple? Before I was a professional in an industry, these were the brands and the products that they made that really made me love something that was ostensibly a commercial product I could buy.

(00:12:29):
What do you think Walt Disney was optimizing for when he was crafting Disneyland? What do you think Phil Knight was thinking about when he made that first version of the Nike running shoe? What do you think Steve Jobs was imagining and daydreaming about when thinking about the iPhone or the Macintosh? By all means, numbers are a fantastic way to be honest with yourself about whether or not you are achieving what you aim to do. But at the moment of creation, at the stage as product people, wondering what should we do, and why, and how? We think it's much more important for us to think about the human, the person at the other end, and how we really want to make them feel.

(00:13:10):
I think one tangible example of that is when I was at Facebook, I joined in the midst of Snapchat's ascendancy. And, there was a lot of feelings about how are we doing, should we be worried? And the way that we would have that conversation would be, how many times per week do people share on Facebook? Do they post something? We even had an acronym OBPS. It's like seared into my memory. What is OBPS? And how is it trending over time? Well, I think we should have been asking, and what we at least would ask at The Browser Company and our way of product development is, "Do we think people feel closer to their friends and family?" Or something of that nature?

(00:13:52):
I think that's what Snapchat got so right. They weren't obsessing about something like, "How many people put an image into the composer and hit the plus button. And the number of times per week means success." They were thinking about something much more human and essential. And so, that is what we've [inaudible 00:14:07] The Browser Company. Don't optimize for metrics, don't optimize for graphs. Use that as a way to keep you honest, and use it as a tool in your toolkit. But fundamentally, none of us are here for that. We're there to make people feel something.

Lenny (00:14:19):
As you pointed out, I think a lot of the people are listening are like, "I love that. I wish I could do that. I want to optimize for feelings, but then I got to drive the business forward. I got goals to hit. I want to keep people accountable." I'm curious how you operationalize this approach? How do you actually implement this idea? I imagine you still have goals and metrics and you guys, you talked about retention and things like that.

Josh Miller (00:14:42):
Yeah. Obviously it's difficult to do that in the abstract for another company, and it may not work for every company and every product. But, for example, one of the reasons we found this to be so effective so far is, if you pick the right feeling, it typically tracks pretty closely with the metric you care about. So, for example, we don't have a growth team and we have no semblance of growth projects. However, in many of the new features that we put out into the world, we want people to feel surprise or joy or an emotion like that. Guess what? When people feel that way, they go, "Oh, my God, what was that?" And they start telling their friends and family about it, and they start dropping a screenshot in Slack, et cetera. So, there's one example on the consumer side. I've never built traditional enterprise software selling to CIOs, et cetera. But I can imagine maybe someone in the IT department of a large enterprise wants to feel smart, or wants to feel ahead of the curve or wants to feel secure and ease at what they're doing.

(00:15:54):
I think sometimes we just forget that whoever your buyer is, or whatever your business objective, at the end of the day we're a bunch of people in a bunch of rooms at the other side of these screens. And just thinking about that person, it could be a buyer, it could be a customer. But I think the truth is the answer to the question Lenny is, when I was earlier in my career, I was searching for the answers or the way to do things, the right, the wrong, the binary. I think anyone that's been doing this or anything for a while learns that it's all nuanced. It's a spectrum. It depends. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

(00:16:26):
But I think the true answer, Lenny, is just optimizing for metrics so purely is deeply flawed in my opinion. Optimizing for feelings so purely is flawed as well. And it depends on what you are doing, what the project is and a lot of other things. But I think the reason we come out so strongly is, I do think Silicon Valley has tended so far towards optimizing for graphs and metrics, that if we can reel it back in a little bit, at least as just one company, I think that will be good. But the truth is, it's both. We need to use all the tools we can get, but I think hopefully that's one way that people can operationalize.

Lenny (00:17:05):
I'm curious, just to poke out a little bit, how you actually implement that? So maybe as an example, you recently launched this Peek feature, where you mouse over, I think, a link and it opens up in a little browser that doesn't last. Do you put together a little spec of some sort of, "We're trying to create surprise, and maybe here's a metric we think about it." What's actual day-to-day operational approach to a new feature, in terms of feelings versus metrics?

Josh Miller (00:17:32):
Yeah. The truth is I don't think we've operationalized it as formally as we should one day. And we'll probably need to one day. The lucky thing is we are a very tight group of individuals that have now worked together for a long time. So not so formal as there's a PRD at the top of it, we list out the emotions. It's much more, with that project, get Ben in a room and whoever else is working on it and say, "All right. So here's what we're trying to do for people. Here's the problem we're trying to solve or the way we fit in their day. And in that moment people want to feel very light and airy."

(00:18:05):
So, for the Peek feature [inaudible 00:18:07] he's referencing the use cases. You're on Hacker News and you want to probably in pretty quick succession check out five to seven URLs. And you're not really sure which one you're going to spend time on, but you're going to open a bunch of stuff really quickly. And Peek allows you to effortlessly just peek into it, without leaving Hacker News and context switching to this whole new tab and going back and forth. So in that scenario, the conversation was how do we make it feel really airy and effortless to just whoop, pop it up, pop it back down, lightness, airiness, speed, agility. So again, it's not that we have a, "What is the number one feeling and the number two feeling?" It is much more conversational at this stage, but I am actually really excited. Hopefully we got the privilege one day to have such a large team that we have to figure out a way to do it. So, that's an example of how we think about it.

Lenny (00:18:57):
It's a good segue to a question I wanted to touch on. So, I asked Scott Belsky what I should ask you. He's a big fan of yours. I don't know if he's an investor? But he's just like, "I love Josh." And asked him, "What should I ask Josh?" And one of his questions was about, you guys ship very quickly. You're shipping meaningful features every Friday. And you also close the loop really well with customers when they come ask for something. You're like, "Hey, here. We did it." What is it that you do, and what can people learn from the way you all operate that allows you to ship quickly?

Josh Miller (00:19:26):
Well, first of all, thank you Scott, if you're listening. It's somewhat of an awkward question admittedly, because it's like someone complimenting you about your product. It's always impossible to really take and accept the compliment, because you see all the blemishes. Of course we see all these ways in which we don't ship fast enough and could be doing a better job listening and building with members. But, at risk of sounding a bit cliche, I really think we ship our values. So, we thought a lot about our values as a company. You can read about them online. And I think if you examine those values and then you look at your compliment or Scott's compliment, you can see [inaudible 00:20:05] one-to-one. So the first, and I really think the most important is, we hire people that show up with heartfelt intensity.

(00:20:11):
And, a lot of companies I think obsess over craft details. They'll be a value like, "We obsess over the details." What we say is, we want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details, for other people it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering head count. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you give them a very exciting, ambitious prompt and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work. So, showing up with heartfelt intensity.

(00:20:54):
Our second value is assume you don't know. Assume you don't know. And the value "assume you don't know" is, even if you're a subject matter expert. We have someone in our company that literally built the first version of Chrome and ran it for 16 years. But he more than anyone embodies this beginner's mind of, "I have no idea how this should work or what will happen." And the follow up to that value is, "So we got to get going." It's like dropping in a new city. You just got to walk out the door of your Airbnb turn left and ... Maybe you'll turn right and then you'll hop on the subway, but you just got to get going and see what you find. And so, we have this attitude of, you're showing up with this heartfelt intensity. But you start by saying, "I've no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going to happen." So we've just got to get going. And that biases in a default to action.

(00:21:44):
We have another value of, start by asking, "What could be?", which is pushing ourselves to be as aspirational, ambitious as possible. So the Peek feature that you mentioned, we just didn't want to solve the problem of context switching. We wanted to almost blur the line between native and web software, and make it feel like a sheet of paper. And really pushing ourselves to be as ambitious as we can be, which is the consequence of blowing back around and more deeply motivating the people working on it.

(00:22:13):
So, I mean, I could keep going. We have a value, "You're doing it for the crew when you got to swarm. When you got to swarm," and we have value of, "make them feel something." But I think what it all adds up to is, a team that has a lot of heart, has a lot of intrinsic motivation and a, "It's the first day of my career. I wonder what's going to happen?" attitude. And I think all of those things add up to a culture which is, "Let's get something out there. Let's see what happens."

Lenny (00:22:46):
How did you come up with these? What was the process to come up with company values? Because I know a lot of companies are like, "We should come up with these." How do you do that?

Josh Miller (00:22:54):
The secret is I hate corporate values. I've never resonated with them. And I'm fortunate, we're fortunate enough, to have a lot of really spectacular, experienced leaders in our corner. And I got hammered to the first year, two years on, "Josh, where are your values? How can your team operate without values?" And I always experienced them on the other end as almost corporate propaganda, these cliche fortune cookie, Panda Express-like, "You should care about the detail." It didn't resonate with me. And the thing that clicked was maybe a year and a half, two years into working, I just kept hearing the same things from the team. And I would do things like a year into someone joining, "How's it going? What's going well? What's not?" And I realized that there are some traits that define our team, extremely organically and naturally. No one told people what our values were.

(00:23:51):
Again, because I was this naive, ignorant 31-year-old being like, "Values are a corporate, late-stage capitalism creation," and just very, very hardheaded. And it was really special two years in, hearing from the team why they love The Browser Company, why they think we're doing ... Just the passion there. And then we challenged ourselves to what became a value. Well, if something about the five one-liners on the corporate webpage feels off, start by asking what could be in dream a little bit. And what I realized was, all of the statements people would say about what they loved about The Browser Company, what they thought defined the way we work, they reminded me of how I like to take road trips. I'm a big traveler. I'm a big fan of dropping in somewhere new and just exploring. And so we just had this "Aha!" Moment. Let's, instead of having a corporate landing page with five value titles and subtitles, let's write a manual for how to take a road trip.

(00:24:54):
So we wrote an essay called "Notes on Road Trips" that use this semi-biographical, but mostly fictional, story about a person and their father taking a road trip when they're a teenager, to tell the story of how we do things at The Browser Company. And share these values, but in a way that hopefully won't feel so propagandary and feel a little more, you're reading an essay. So I say that, again, not to say there's anything wrong with traditional values. I'm actually sure I'm going to get an earful for a lot of people that coach me and give me advice that I sounded too indignant on this podcast. But I'm pretty proud of that story because it was a great example of assuming you don't know. We were sure that corporate values were not for us. And then very organically without trying it turned out, "Wait! They run through this company in a pretty profound way. We should put some words around it, because it's happening whether or not we like it, or say it is or not."

Lenny (00:25:49):
That's awesome. I have the page here and it's quite beautiful. And, pulling to it in the show notes just very briefly and tactically, did you just sit down and start writing this thing and then people gave you feedback? How long did this process take? Just for folks that maybe you want to go down this road?

Josh Miller (00:26:03):
Yeah. Warning downside of this process that it takes a lot longer than we thought it would, because we put so much heart into it. So, what it started with was again, in my natural one-year, check-in type conversation, starting to notice these patterns. And then we actually very comprehensively were like, "Okay. Let's sit down and interview everyone at The Browser Company. But no survey. One by one, talking to people, asking questions. And then we pulled out those words. So, actually what's really cool about these values, if my memory serves me, I believe every single one, with the exception of maybe a word or two, was something that someone on our team said. So we interviewed the entire team and then these are meant to be a mirror. The putting it in road trip essay form? That took a long time. That that was a lot of ... Yeah. I don't recommend the way that we did that, but-

Lenny (00:27:02):
How long is long?

Josh Miller (00:27:03):
Probably three months.

Lenny (00:27:06):
Oh. That does not sound that long. Okay.

Josh Miller (00:27:07):
Yeah. Maybe this goes back to Scott's comment that maybe our bar to how quickly we should ship stuff including values is, it's like I don't know. But, yeah. It felt like a long time. And this was not just me. Just for anyone listening, this was not CEO in a corner writing a missive. This was a team effort. There's a woman Abby on our team that did so much work on this project. The words themselves came from our team. So, it has my name I think somewhere on that webpage, but by no means was this me writing this essay in a corner with the fireplace on, or anything like that.

Lenny (00:27:40):
Okay. Awesome. That was really helpful. As you also saw, I asked on Twitter what to ask you, and I got a ton of questions. People have a lot of questions for how y'all do stuff. The most common question turned out was from Ched Khan who had the most likes of all the questions that people asked you. And it was around hiring, that basically you've been able to convince some of the most amazing people in the world to join The Browser Company. Like you just mentioned, you hired the guy that built Chrome, basically, to work on Arc now. What is it that you do that convinces amazing people to join? Because everyone wants to learn from you and copy you, and do that themselves.

Josh Miller (00:28:15):
Thank you for that question and for all the legs. I will admit, this is also a fairly awkward one to ask. I actually just came from an interview with a candidate and they asked me a fairly similar question. And I said, "You know what? You should go ask the people that work here. It's not me. I don't know why they ultimately join." But what I will tell you is, the intentionality, which is another secret, sharing a lot of secrets. This one will probably get me in trouble. I don't care about web browsers. I've never cared about web browsers. I never wanted to build a web browser. If you had told me a decade ago that I'd be working on a desktop first web browser at 32, "I'd say what in my career went horribly wrong?" The origin story of this company was Hursch, who I met when I was 20. We started a company together. Lots of mistakes, a lot of successes, a lot of growing pains and figured out who we are. And a decade later we were still friends, we went to each other's weddings.

(00:29:10):
We'd worked in all these different industries and different-stage companies and we just realized, "You know what? There are a lot of ideas that get us really excited. There are a lot of shapes and sizes." But as we were nostalgic for looking back on the decade prior, it was groups of people and moments in time with those people that were our best memories. And so, what Hursch and I decided, long before the company started was, we want to build a company, but we want to build a company where we feel like we can hire whoever we want. And I don't mean whoever we want in terms of who would dare say no. But we want to work on something where the greatest minds in our industry and adjacent would want to work on that prompt in a hypothetical sense. And then build an organization, build a team where we can work in the way that, after a decade of trying on a bunch of hats and ways of doing things and metrics this and [inaudible 00:30:04], we could do what was right for us.

(00:30:06):
And so, where we went to with a new web browser, let alone a web browser as a new form of computing, which is our true aspiration, to build an internet here. You can look up the internet computer YouTube video on our Browser Company YouTube page. But our ambition's even higher than a web browser. The intention of that is, we just want to go hire our favorite people that we know and don't know and build a team that, we'll never get bored working with this crew, because of how incredible they are and how humble they are. And so, when you think about it like that, I as the CEO as notionally the head of product, I view our product as our team. And I know a lot of companies say that. I actually think they probably all mean it. I don't think anyone's being disingenuous, but we really meet it. It is the genesis of this company.

(00:30:55):
It is not a new web browser. It is, let's build the dream team, our dream team. And let's build a way of working that is really fun for us and really speaks to our values. And let's go find people that resonate with that. And that trickles down to everything we do, whether it's our policy about this or the way we do that. I'll give you one example. Our goal of interviews is to convince people not to join The Browser Company. If I have an interview with someone, I don't pitch them and say, "What do you want to ask me? Anything you want? I'll be super honest, most people shouldn't want to work here." So I think it all starts with us viewing our product as the company, as the team, not Arc itself. And then, I think being self-aware, that that's how I think that's how we think.

(00:31:43):
But again, flying back things that I've heard, we have been fortunate. We've hired a lot of really remarkable people, especially on paper and especially off. I mean, all around. I'll just give a couple examples to share one thing that I've heard. A few recent hires, we hired someone named Darren who, as I mentioned, he co-created the first prototype of Chrome and then ran it for 16 years. I think hundreds if not thousands of people reported to him. He joined the Browser Company as an IC. We just hired a woman named Tara. She was on the original Paper by 53 team, one of my most inspiring products at the beginning of my career. Most recently she was actually, I believe, Senior SVP of product at Vimeo and a senior director of engineering. She joined our engineering team as an IC. We just hired someone named Peter Vidani. When I was 20 building consumer social software, he was the coolest, most impressive person. He was the first designer at Tumblr. Ran the design team at Tumblr for seven years and the most recently was SVP of design at Slack. Joined the team as an IC designer.

(00:32:48):
And though that sounds like I'm bragging, the thing that was really interesting and perplexing to us was, these are people that have made a lot of money, that have had really fancy titles, that have worked on transformative projects. Why are they joining this team? And I think something that people show up to The Browser Company with is, in addition to heartfelt intensity, this aspiration that their work at The Browser Company will come to define their careers. And that's coming from people that have done really remarkable things, by all accounts. And I think more than anything, we've realized that, in order for people like that to join and to show up with that, there are a number of things you have to promise and provide them, that make folks like that gravitate with the intention of doing their work of their career, ranging from an incredible and ambitious aspiration, really empowerment to act on the prompts that they're given on behalf of the team in the way that they see fit, and truly trusting and empowering them.

(00:33:54):
A very kind culture. I think if you've been doing this for a decade plus, your intolerance for bullshit is very, very low. And so, by no means do I think we're perfect. I don't think everyone shows up The Browser Company saying, "If I'm not on the equivalent of the early iPhone team, I'm going to be bummed." But I think generally speaking, Hursh and I, and everyone that was on the early team showed up with this aspiration of making The Browser Company the product. And I think that's carried forward to this tumbleweed of people saying, "[inaudible 00:34:23]. That's where I'm going to finally do the equivalent of building the iPhone." And we all know we probably won't, but there is that, "I want to give it one more shot. I want to go for it." And that just tumbleweeds, I think, at some point.

Lenny (00:34:37):
That tumbleweed is, I think a big part of it is, once you get amazing people, more amazing people want to join. So I think that's very much helpful. Something else this resonates a lot with is, just the mission of a company is such a powerful tool for pulling people in, the best people. I've seen that a lot with founders. If they have a meaningful mission, it's so much easier to hire, versus not. And clearly you're really good at sharing that vision and mission. And then you also have a really interesting mission and vision. I think there's also, you're just a charismatic founder and that helps a lot too. And you're a great storyteller.

Josh Miller (00:35:08):
Well, the other thing I want to add Lenny is, again putting myself in the listener, I imagine a lot of what I just said probably sounded a little bit ... Could come off, if you don't know me and you don't, as a little bombastic or a little again romantic. Very tactically, I'll give you something that was just who we are, but I think has helped contribute to this tumbleweed. From the very first person we hired, we celebrated them publicly. The fact that they joined. And in a very heartfelt way, telling you about them as a person and what they did. Long before we had anyone that anyone would've heard of before working at The Browser Company, just because it was earnest, we were really proud. Again, if you think of our original mandate as building the companies, the product, when our first designer joins, we want to tell everyone about it. That's a product launch. That is the product launch.

(00:35:57):
And then, whenever we ship something, we go out of our way to celebrate the people that worked on it publicly. I think there's a CEO-hero worship sometimes in Silicon Valley. I do very little at the company. Or sorry. I do very little as it relates to the thing people fall in love with Arc. I do a lot for The Browser Company, but I don't make Arc. I didn't make Peek. And again, that's just who we are, which is, "Alexandre. She killed me! Look at how cool this is!" because it's earnest and it's honest to who we are. And then I think it creates this reinforcing cycle of you're someone that's done something incredible, which is, "I'm going to be celebrated. They truly want me here. I'm going to be recognized for the work that I do.

(00:36:39):
It's not going to just accrue to this like CEO figurehead who everyone thinks is some genius visionary. And so again, by no means are we perfect. By no means do I think we get it right all the time. But, because it's such an authentic expression of who we are and what we were trying to do, I think we do little micro implementations like that, that ladder up to that principle I got so excited about but are as simple as someone tweets about some animation. They're like, "Woo! This was fun." Tag Sherry. Sherry made that, Sherry's incredible. And you don't see that that much in Silicon Valley. You see corporate blog posts and the CEOs more than anyone else. That's probably why you don't have CEOs on the podcast, because you don't want ... You know this Lenny. That is why that's your policy. You don't want to hear from the CEOs. They're not the ones building the product. You want to hear from the people actually doing it. That's why I love this podcast.

Lenny (00:37:26):
That's right. That's right. Thank you. I'd say just hearing everything you're saying, The Browser Company sounds like an incredible place to work. I could see why people want to go work. It's pretty simple. You touched on being public and sharing everything that's going on. And that's another area I wanted to spend a little time on. You guys are very transparent about what's going on and inside the company. You bring cameras into the board meetings. I watched a half-hour meeting you had with your head of design talking about a project that's behind scheduling. You're trying to figure out how do we get this out the door. You just share actual things you all are doing within the company, publicly. And I'm curious just, why did you start doing that? What have you seen as a good or bad that has come from that? Is there anything you've shared that maybe you regret like "Oh, maybe we shouldn't have put that out there." What's been your experience with that?

Josh Miller (00:38:17):
Why don't I start with the regret. It's not yet a regret, but the thing that I wonder ... Because this is very much ... I may have hopefully spoken with a lot of earnest passion to some of the questions before. This is one that I would really characterize as a prototype. We really have a prototype-driven culture. And this is one that I'd put high on the list of, "Maybe we'll regret this later." And specifically what I hope is that, I'm uncomfortable putting myself too central in our story. But, naturally, when you're doing storytelling publicly, there's a gravitational pull for the CEO and the founders to be at the center of that. And so, sometimes even this morning, we had our best-performing YouTube video ever. The first one that really broke out of people that already follow us. And it's a reaction video in classic YouTube form to MKBHD talking about our product for the first time.

(00:39:13):
And I honestly watched it right before this again, and I was like, "What the fuck am I doing? What are we doing? Why am I trying to become a YouTuber?" So, to be totally honest, I don't regret anything yet. But I wonder if we could take this too far? So if anyone's listening, if you see us starting to take this too far, especially as it relates to me, we want to hear about it, because that's keeping me up. But I do think the intentions are pure and earnest, which are ... And another thing that defines people that have joined The Browser Company, in addition to wanting to do the work that defines their careers, is I would characterize it as a little bit of hopelessness, maybe feeling jaded, questioning this industry that they've worked on or products that they've worked on and wanting to rediscover. But, at the end of the day, we are a group of idealists, of optimists, wanting to rediscover what we fell in love with when we were kids, whether it's the part of our craft or the potential of technology, the internet and software.

(00:40:19):
And, as part of that, I would view Arc and the Browser Company as an experiment in we can do it. Better is possible. And as we were thinking about better as possible, rediscovering what we love and believe in deep down and trying to express it in the world, one of it related to trust. I remember when I was a teenager using the internet for the first time and early on to college, just the hopefulness of what was possible, and the belief that these people building these tools, they were like heroes to me. Not just the leaders, but the teams, the companies, the brands. And somewhere along the way, I'm not blaming a single company, I'm not even saying that anyone did anything wrong, but culturally ... I was a sociology major. Culturally, we have lost trust in tech companies and in tech brands.

(00:41:10):
And so, building in public showing you our meetings, uncomfortably so, is an act in, "If we were them, why should they trust us? Why should anyone trust us?" We have your most sensitive personal data. We have your most sensitive professional data. Why should you trust us if we've had our trust broken again and again? And I think our hypothesis in this prototype, in this experiment is, we can have the best privacy policy in the world, but at the end of the day, again, it's just people behind the screen. And so, even if I think about ... I haven't done interviews like this, because I worry that if you don't know me, I come off the wrong way.

(00:41:51):
A lot of people tend to. I've noticed a lot of friends in my life that I know them behind the scenes, but the way that people perceive them publicly here don't know them. They interpret it the other way, because there's not that trust. And so our bet is that if you get to know us, Nash, Dina, me Hursch, and you really feel like you get to know us as person and all of our imperfections, we're average looking, we're average to all that stuff. Then when you see that we're asking for a permission, you might trust it is because we want to make you feel a certain way that's better. And if not ... I'll say someone tweeted something yesterday, who apparently we didn't earn the trust yet and they haven't gone to know us. And their interpretation of what we were doing was the worst possible interpretation you could [inaudible 00:42:40]. And, at first honestly, I felt a bit of anger, like, "Who was this person on a Thursday just saying we're doing X and Y?" And then I realized, "You know what? I'd have the same feeling because of the experiences I've had with technology in the past five to 10 years."

(00:42:53):
And so, the intention with these the building and public experiments are radical trust building. Not radical transparency, we can't share everything, but radical trust building. You get to know us as humans and I worry that we'll regret that, and that it could potentially turn into, "Oh, they're trying to be internet celebrities that they're so important, they should share everything because ... Thank you, them, for gracing us with their opinions." It's not the intention and it feels worth taking that risk. But that's the intentionality behind it.

Lenny (00:43:24):
That is a really interesting insight. It makes a lot of sense for a browser to find that so important, to build that trust.

Josh Miller (00:43:31):
I haven't done podcast interviews, I haven't done this. I really like you. I really like the feeling of your conversations, the intentions behind them, the warmth, even your intro music is a friendly jig. So, I mean, it's a great example, where I think it's one of the most wonderful things about the podcasting medium is I've had you in my ear for a year and the people on your show and you feel a sense of trust in you and your intentions here. And your intentions both in this interview, in terms of what you're trying to do for listeners. To some extent your show, and the warmth that you bring to it and the perception I have as a human being ... We've never met. We've maybe DM'd briefly, maybe five messages exchanged. But I feel like I know you and that makes me trust you. And so, in many ways this podcast, at a meta level's an inspiration for it.

Lenny (00:44:23):
I feel the same way in reverse. You made this point about being worried about being two front and center for your company. I have the same exact feeling. Even though my newsletter's called "Lenny's Newsletter," I only named it that because that was the default recommendation when I was signing up for Substack. I didn't want to be this, "I know it all. Come to me. Welcome to my know-it-all place." I really dislike that. And that's why I created this community that lives along the side, where people can help each other, because I'm not going to have all answers. And so, I've had to lead into that. "All right, people." They want a person to help them understand what's going on, learn about ... And in your videos you do a great job highlighting other people. I was watching your board meeting video and it's like, "Here's all team members coming along. Here they come. How are you doing?" So, anyway. All that to say, you're doing a great job finding the balance.

Josh Miller (00:45:14):
Oh, thank you. You as well.

Lenny (00:45:15):
I appreciate it. You talked about storytelling, and you mentioned that you have a whole bunch of odd teams at The Browser Company. One of them is a storytelling team. And that actually explains, I think, how you're so good at making these really amazing videos, because making great videos is hard. Can you just talk about some of these odd teams that you have, that probably other companies don't?

Josh Miller (00:45:34):
One of the other things that, hopefully, you're picking up in this interview, so far, is we are a very prototype-driven culture. It goes back to the "assume you don't know" ethos. We try a lot of experiments, and we try them related to product features related to how we work together, related to the stories we tell. So, this isn't a category of, "I'm not sure it's going to work, but we're trying it," and it seems to be working so far, at least for us. What Lenny's referencing is, we have a handful of teams. I'll pick two just as an examples. We have a membership team and we have a storytelling team. And though you probably recognize or are obviously familiar with those terms, those aren't historically startup orgs, or startup disciplines and teams. And let me tell you about the intention behind both.

(00:46:16):
Membership. Membership was, when I was at Facebook, the most impressive thing to me about how Facebook built product was their user research team. Shout out to Lowie and Jane. I don't know why you'd be listening to this podcast, but you deeply inspired me when we were at Facebook together. They had the most incredible team of user researchers. And it always felt odd to me. And this isn't Lowie and Jane's fault. Actually, in fact, they suffered from this. That user research almost felt like a service organization, relative to product engineering design. There'd be a PM. The PM would get assigned a researcher and the PM got to decide how to use the researcher, and ask them what to do and ask them questions. But seeing the potential for when you really get to know the people that you are building for, that you're serving, at a really deep way, it is extraordinary. How do you build product any other way?

(00:47:09):
And so, we took that to the extreme at The Browser Company, which we said, "Let's not think of it as customer support, customer service, customer success, user research. Those are just business terms. Those are just industry terms." At the end of the day, what we're saying is if there is a human being, from the moment they touch our software or our products for the first time, to, if they have it last, we need to have a deep, genuine, ongoing relationship with them.

(00:47:36):
And on day one, that may be air quote, "customer success." "How do I use this thing?" On day 37, that might be, "I have a bug. Do you mind helping me fix it?" And on day 58, that may be, "Hey, we're shipping the mobile app soon. What do you want from mobile? What do you want on your phone?" Other companies view that as different orgs and disciplines. We view that as, there are a bunch of people at the other end of this that we are serving from the moment they touch our product the first time. Let's own that relationship full stack and think about it holistically. And so that's the membership team.

(00:48:07):
On the storytelling side, very similar, different type of person. Again, we're a humanistic the company. So, the theme here is the people on the company, the people at the other end. So if the membership team takes people from the moment they touch our product for the first time to the last, the storytelling team is about people we don't have the privilege of serving yet. They don't use Arc, they don't know what Arc is. That could be an investor, air quote, "investor relations." That could be members of the press, air quote, "PR." That could be just people out in the world, air quote, "marketing" and one-day sales. But at the end of the day, it's telling our story to people. It's telling our story to people and thinking about that holistically in full stack.

(00:48:47):
So that's how we think about teams is, we start with first principles asking, what are we really trying to do here? And what is the most direct way to manifest that, even if it's not how other people do it? In practice, one of the benefits of that is I do think it leads to certain pieces of content. For example, that people go, "Oh, wow! I've never seen that before." But again, I think anyone's capable of this. I think we have an extraordinarily talented storytelling team and membership team, but I really think it's as simple as the intentionality of what is the team? What are their incentives? What are the disciplines on the team? Even hiring a video editor, for example, as a small company. But the video editor, not having make a TikTok account go viral. But think about it more holistically in terms of the people.

(00:49:33):
So, again, there's a lot that breaks down. There's a lot that's not going well about it. I have no idea how the scales, the 500 people ... Yeah. So this is not me saying this experiment is ultimately going to be a huge success, or right for everyone or even us at different times. But that was the intentionality of the membership team, the storytelling team and others. And even product management. We don't have PMs at the company. My title at Facebook was Product Manager. I love product management. But, we view it not as a team. We view it as a leader, a role on a project, on an effort.

(00:50:07):
And depending on the projects, different types of people should be a PM. So, we have a performance-related project going on where, of course, an infrastructure engineer should be that air quote, "PM." We have a product project, where actually I think someone from membership should be the PM, because ultimately, yes, we're building software product, but it is really about serving our members in a specific way, so we should have someone for membership be a PM. Again, as you can imagine, as is going through the heads of everyone listening, "That must break down in 18 ways?" Oh, it definitely does. And so I'm not promising one day it won't change. But again, continuous through the company is, assume you don't know. Start by asking what could be, and let's just try some things and see what happens.

Lenny (00:50:48):
Start with what could be. I love that value. This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, this sheet tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you, instead of working for you? Why does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process, from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear's designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about Linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large, established companies such as Versel Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using Linear as magical visit linear.app/lenny to try Linear for free with your team and get 25% off when you upgrade. That's linear.app/lenny.

(00:52:00):
So, I was going to ask you actually, you talked about why you don't have PMs. Do you think you'll hire PMs in the future, having a PM background? Do you think you'll get there or do you think you'll try to stick to this? People do the PM role, depending on the project?

Josh Miller (00:52:12):
Yeah. We've increasingly hiring people that at other companies may have a PM title. I'd say we have two to three right now, that could have a PM title at another company. I don't think we will have a pm organization, or a PM role, because again, we believe depending on ... If you unpack the verbs that a PM does, I think those are verbs that anyone that we hire could do. And it really depends on what is the project? And what are we trying to do? I think the thing that will be unwavering is we like to hire mutts. And I haven't yet figured out a term that comes off as more endearing, because it's meant to be very endearing, but ... For example, there's a woman in a company named Rebecca.

(00:52:58):
Rebecca was a data scientist we use at Cora. She got her PhD in MIT in I think behavioral psychology or something. I'm probably going to misquote that. But, got some crazy degree at MIT, and then was a software engineer at Stripe. And I'm talking about Rebecca through her resume. There's so much about Rebecca. She plays effectively a PM role right now. She is effectively PMing our effectively our multi-player team. But what was so awesome about meeting Rebecca is her and other people at this company have the mindset of, "I make things, and I will do what I need to do to make what I want to make. Whenever that verb is, whenever that discipline is." And that requires people that are multidisciplinary in practice and multidisciplinary in approach to their work. It's not that we don't hire PMs, but we want to hire people who have a multidisciplinary approach and view things as, "I like to make things. Tell me how I contribute to making it." And sometimes they may play the verbs of a PM and sometimes it may be something else.

Lenny (00:54:07):
This can be a really interesting story to follow. I've seen this journey a few times at different companies. What I find is a lot of times people that are good at other things like engineering or design, for a while, they're like, "Yep. We don't need PMs. I'll do the PM job." And then eventually they're like, "This sucks. I hate doing this stuff. I want to design. Leave me alone. I don't want to sit on a [inaudible 00:54:29] all day. I don't want to be in meetings." So eventually, it turns out, they're like, "Okay. Let's find someone to do this thing that loves it." And so that's one thing that happens.

(00:54:36):
The other thing I find is, I'm sure you've seen this, a lot of people are wary of PMs. They come in and they're like, "Here's what we're doing," and they're just adults process complexity. What I find is those are just bad PMs. If you have an awesome PM, everything just gets better. Everyone's happier, things move faster. So I think companies often get to that stage. And then also there's just career development stuff, eventually as you scale. It's like "What happened to my career path," and they're like, "All right. Well, we got to go on one road or another." It's hard to stay in this hybrid role. But I super respect the first principal's approach of let's just-

Josh Miller (00:55:08):
And, for what's worth, Lenny. I think you're almost, definitely right. And I think it will almost definitely happen with us. And again, this goes back to the "assume you don't know." The "assume you don't know," is try a prototype and then assume it's not going to work. So, even in my own experience, I remember getting to know Evan from Snapchat just enough to know how he talked about PMs at Snap. And it was, "We're never going to hire PMs at Snap. Everyone's a designer." And, I have no relationship with him anymore, but you can look, there are a lot of PMs at Snapchat.

(00:55:37):
So I know from my own experience with people that I respect from a product perspective that were indignant, they would never hire PMs, their organizations now have PMs. And that's probably for a really good reason. I would tell say also on our team, if any of our designers are listening, they'll tell you these, whatever you want to call it, "These verbs are taking up a lot of my time, and I do not have as much time to think and dream and design and do user research." And so, we're already feeling it breaking into our company.

(00:56:04):
I think the intentionality, whatever comes next, whatever it is, is leaders of the project should be picked for the projects, not because they're in a certain org at our company. And, if we ever hire people to do the PM role, we want them to think of themselves as people who make things and have lots of different disciplines and tools in their toolkit, not just the PM discipline. And, of course, even that could be wrong, and maybe in a year we cave. I got it totally wrong. We got it totally wrong. So, we'll see. But I would also, that that of all the things I shared on this podcast so far, this is probably the one I'll come crawling back to your podcast in a couple years, being, "Lenny, you were right. It all blew up!"

Lenny (00:56:47):
But it's a fun experiment and Snap is a good example. Stripes another, where they waited a long time to hire their first PMs. And I think it's because their designers or engineers were just incredibly good at that element. And it was also very design-forward or very edge-forward, so they didn't need as much PM skill initially.

Josh Miller (00:57:03):
If I had to predict, I would predict that if we found that we were missing this discipline as a team, I think we would evolve Rebecca's team, which is technically the data team, and do something closer to a technical PM or data plus [inaudible 00:57:19] Again, it's all live, but the thought has even crossed our minds recently, that we may be wrong, and what org might we create if we need folks that have more of a background of [inaudible 00:57:29] like this.

Lenny (00:57:30):
I'm excited for the video of this discussion that might happen. It's also interesting, your PM that you mentioned, Rebecca is very data oriented. And then, the initial discussion we had around focus on feelings and that sort of thing. So, that's cool that you have this really interesting balance of people that are very data focused and then this, "Okay. But let's not obsess with that. What are the feelings we're trying to create?"

Josh Miller (00:57:50):
Yeah. Because again, the point of optimizing for feelings is not hire people who make feelings. It's like Rebecca's title is Data Lead. She runs our data team. But, Rebecca's one of the most humanistic people I know. You meet her and you feel the warmth that you feel when you talk to you, and you ask her what she does outside of work. And so, it's not that data doesn't have a role. Actually I'd say, for better or worse, data is part of our practice. It's more about what's that top-level intentionality? What are we trying to do here? But, yeah. We have a lot of people that, data is either a noun they've had in their resume or it's been a part of their practice a lot in the past.

Lenny (00:58:29):
Awesome. One very tactical question with the storytelling team makes me think about Airbnb's video team. A lot of people are joking internally for years and years that the videos Airbnb put out in the early days accounts for half their market cap, because they're so good. And you're just like, "Oh, my God, I want to go on an Airbnb." They just make you feel so much and they're soul made. So, what is the makeup of your storytelling team? Because I imagine some companies maybe listening, like maybe we should do something like this on our team.

Josh Miller (00:58:57):
We have a three-person storytelling team. It's run by a woman named Nash. There is a gentleman named Ellis, who is a ... Background, started as a reporter at The Verge. Maybe there was a publication before that. But I met him when he was a reporter at The Verge covering social media. And then he ran marketing strategy for Snapchat for seven years. And then we have a person named Josh Lee, who I actually met as an intern. He was an intern at Facebook as a designer, that an intern for me at the White House when I worked at the White House, and then decided that he was over product design and over design, and totally just jumped and be like, "I'm going to be a filmmaker," and has been making really fascinating indie films for a few years now. And he's our video editor on the team.

(00:59:44):
And it's so interesting. Nash's background, she had a brief stint at NBC. But again, you get to know her and she writes poems after hours and her dream is to write a fictional book. I mean, anyone that knows Nash, especially [inaudible 01:00:00] is just a force. A force. And the three of them, what's so interesting about them, which also relates to our design team ... One of the things I also found at Facebook is there was a tendency toward homogeneity. As you know, there's a stereotype of a Facebook PM for example, or a Google PM, the contrast between them and the way they work. And one of the things we also have purposely done on the storytelling team and otherwise, let's hire radically different archetypes. Ellis cannot be more different than Nash. Nash cannot be more different than Josh. There's some shared values, there's some shared beliefs, but they're very different.

(01:00:35):
Ditto on the design team. Our design team? They are all over the place in terms of who they are, what they've done, their sensibilities, their aspirations. And whether it's the storytelling team or the design team, that can be hard sometimes, just to be honest. It's a lot easier to say, "Hey, we're the Acme Co storytelling team, we're Acme Co design team. We hire designers like this and storytellers that." We hire people all over the place. We have an extremely diverse team, but in all senses of the word. But again, the no PM thing, it's not without flaws. I can see why a lot of large companies over time tend are like, "It's the Facebook way or no way," or "You're not good for here."

Lenny (01:01:14):
Yeah. It's actually I think, exact makeup of Airbnb video team. I forget what they were called. They didn't have a cool name, the storytelling team I think. But it was a videographer, an editor and then their producer, basically.

Josh Miller (01:01:26):
Yeah. I mean, I remember going to Airbnb's offices early in my career and seeing the storyboards lining the walls and just being like, "I want to work here." So, I'm actually not familiar with the ... I mean, I'm familiar with Airbnb's videos and brand marketing, fucking fantastic, excuse my language. But, yeah. I remember just walking around that office being like, "Oh, my goodness! Are they making a movie or something? I want to [inaudible 01:01:53] here."

Lenny (01:01:54):
Funny you say that. And for folks that want to find that, we'll link to it in show notes. But if you Google "Snow White Airbnb," you'll actually see these storyboards. They basically hired a Pixar storyboard artist to draw out key frames of the journey of a host and a guest. And that became a central element of the strategy of, let's make each of these moments as amazing as possible. And it was based on the movie Snow White. You can read about it.

Josh Miller (01:02:15):
For what it's worth, this is a great moment to share. All of the beliefs that I've shared here on behalf of our team, these aren't things that we just originally came up with. They're moments like when I went to Airbnb's office early in my career and saw these Snow White storyboards lining the walls. That had an impact on me. Even the idea that you would think in terms of that moment, you could actually see the lineage to, well, how do you want that person to feel when they open that door for the first time? So, I think it's just a great moment to shout out that we've accumulated a lot of doses of inspiration, like that day at Airbnb, that trickle down to us talking about optimizing for feelings. But that didn't come in a vacuum. That's our expression of what we've seen in the industry. This is building on the backs of so many people and companies that we've been fortunate to see.

Lenny (01:03:03):
And now the trickling is happening from your lessons and experience and your unique approach.

Josh Miller (01:03:07):
I hope. There's a documentary that I highly recommend called General Magic. And it's one of the best pieces of media I've seen related to technology industry. And it's really interesting. I think there are two types of people to just be very ... There are people that watch that and view it as, "Wow! What a missed opportunity," or almost like a sad story. And I view it as, "If only we could be so lucky to assemble a group of people like that." And the thing about that documentary, for anyone that hasn't listened to it is, essentially was the iPhone before the iPhone, with the most legendary group of technologists working there. And it totally failed, completely failed by all traditional business definitions.

(01:03:50):
But, what stuck with me from the documentary, how proud and nostalgic and passionate those individuals were in reminiscing about their time there. And then, what they all went on to create. And the fact that even today on this podcast, I'm sitting here talking about General Magic. So, I mean, to your point of hopefully Browser Company will have ripple effects. That to me is the ultimate goal, for me personally, at a very emotional level. If we could only be so lucky. That, to me, seems like success in many ways.

Lenny (01:04:24):
Yeah. What's cool is you're getting a lot of footage that will be very useful for a future documentary on the history of The Browser Company.

Josh Miller (01:04:30):
[inaudible 01:04:30] I didn't think about it like that, for better or worse.

Lenny (01:04:32):
One last thought, I was going to mention it in terms of the storytelling movie-making elements of Airbnb. Fun fact, there was a period where product managers were actually called producers, because one of the founders was like, "We don't want to manage product, we want to produce beautiful experiences," like a movie producer. And so that was a year and a half maybe of Airbnb's history, where product managers were producers. The problem is, we got a lot of job applicants from Emmy-winning producers and they're like, "oh, I want to work at Airbnb."

Josh Miller (01:05:01):
I know this podcast is about very tactical advice. So, one tactical piece of advice I'll give is, whether or not you like the idea of the storytelling team or something else, a byproduct of some of these experiments that we've found works really well is when you give something a new name, it sheds a lot of preconceived notions of what the thing should be. We found that even with product. So if you say you're building a browser history feature, then the benefit is everyone knows what you're talking about. And the downside is, everyone knows what you're talking about. And you show up with these preconceived notions of what it has to be. And so, if you go back again to revalue ask what could be ... In many ways the point of calling the team, the storytelling team or the membership team, or not having PMs as an organization ... All of this stuff isn't meant to be novelty for novelty's sake. It's meant to almost be a rhetorical tactic, to make people think truly first principles about what are we trying to do here?

(01:06:00):
And again, if at the end, producers are called PMs, that's fine. But I assume when it was called a producer, a much more intentionality was given to you communicating and talking and discussing, what does a producer do? What's their relationship with design? Because no one knew what the heck a producer was. And so, ultimately, that may have been failure in other ways. But that's one of the things we found tactically to be really helpful is, whether it's a product feature or a team, or whatever, give it a made up name just to really get to the root of what you're trying to do there. Or not borrow too much from wherever you worked before, whatever you've seen, popular media or whatever.

Lenny (01:06:36):
I love that. And it's very undo ... Like, you've got to undo it. It was-

Josh Miller (01:06:41):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:06:42):
It's a two-way door. And I like just the vision, the value you have of just prototyping things and whatever. It didn't work. Let's go back to what everyone else is doing. You mentioned great product and there was something I definitely wanted to chat a bit about, which is just, there's this group of companies who are just focused on, "Let's just build the most amazing product experience." And I feel like The Browser Company is at the forefront in a lot of this. But it's like you guys, Linear, Raycast is this product, Cron. There's probably a few more and I'd love to actually hear if there's others that I'm not thinking about. That are just obsessed with the user experience and less focused on drive metrics, drive revenue.

(01:07:24):
And I'm curious, just where do you think this goes? What's your take on this trend? Why isn't every company thinking this way? Or is this just like, "We don't know if this is a good idea in the end?" So what's your take on this cohort of just like, "We're just going to build the best possible product and hope it all works out,"?

Josh Miller (01:07:41):
Yeah. Well, I'll say first, I love those products, or many of those products you mentioned. There's some I haven't really used. But, for example, our company runs on Linear, and has run on Linear since day one. So, I'm a big fan of that. So, the way that we think about it is ... So, I actually spent two years at a venture capital firm as an investor, called Thrive Capital. They've invested in Slack and GitHub and a lot of really transformative companies. But I was an investor there. I was a venture capitalist. It even feels weird to say that. And I learned a lot. A lot. A lot. A lot from that experience. It has made me, I think, a better CEO and a better product leader. And one of the things I learned is different ideas, product ideas, business ideas, company ideas come with different attributes and things that will matter to their success.

(01:08:34):
And so, when thinking about starting The Browser Company and picking this category of software, Hursch and I were incredibly intentional about what that would mean for what would need to matter for our company. And so, if you think about the web browser category, traditionally ... I'm not saying forward facing, I'm not saying it is what we are doing. But, if you were to look backwards and take The Browser Company out of it, and look at the web browser category, you'd notice a few things. The first is, it's actually one of the most consumer pieces of software out there. People forget that. That's the opportunity to us. If you ask someone in the street, "What's your web browser? What do you think?" They either won't know or they won't care, "[inaudible 01:09:15]. I don't know."

(01:09:16):
But what pieces of software do your parents, do your little nieces and nephews and you use? What's at the center of that Venn diagram? Your parents hopefully don't use TikTok and Instagram, or probably don't. Your nieces and nephews, I hope don't have a reason for email at the tender age of 16, or a calendar. And a web browser's one of the few things in the middle. So it's an incredibly universal piece of software consumer, unlike very few other things outside of a smartphone and messaging, and maybe video calling in 2023 and a web browser. So, it's very consumer, very universal.

(01:09:52):
The second attribute is, it's a commodity. I'm not saying that Arc is a commodity or we want it to be, but objectively web browsers are interchangeable. They all do the same thing. Increasingly, they're literally just carbon copies of the exact same code chromium, with little tweaks, little tweaks around the edges. So, they're all the same. It's a commodity market. And they're unbelievably lucrative. Browsers print cash. There is a reason why they're owned primarily by Google, Apple and Microsoft. They're incredibly high margin, they're incredibly lucrative. Low marginal costs. The cost of revenue is incredibly low, et cetera, et cetera.

(01:10:30):
So we have a product that everyone in the world uses, where they're all identical, essentially, interchangeable commodities. And if you can get people to use it, you're going to print money. So, the attributes of that business and that product category mean, you have to win on how much do people love your product and feel an emotional connection to it, and choose your brand, your product over the other, almost not rationally, but emotionally. And so, if you tie that back to everything I've said before, bingo! That is what we want to work on. That's what we want. We want to create emotional connection with people. We're creating that emotional connection with as many people as possible and delighting them with surprises and animations, is the way you win. It's not romantic, it is practical. In many ways it's capitalistic. This is how we win this market if you want to think about it that way.

(01:11:30):
So, the reason I hesitate to answer your question directly is, I don't think that applies to every category of software. And to be totally honest, I don't know enough about the ticketing space or the calendaring space or the whatever other space to know, honestly, off the cuff, if that approach is good for those industries. As a human being, at the other end, I'm really grateful that they picked some reason to do it, whether or not it is part of their business strategy or not. It's a really wonderful trend as a human at the other end that cares about feelings. But I would say, we actually think about it not as a, "We're focusing on the user experience over revenue or growth." We, in fact, picked a category of software we're focusing on brand and user experience is how you get growth and revenue.

(01:12:14):
And, because we knew that this is who we are, and if we were building cybersecurity software that you sell to government agencies, they are not going to give a shit about rounded edges, or what color the button is, or how surprised you feel with every member update. So, we didn't build cybersecurity software to sell to the government. So, I hope that more people build things at the craft bar of something like Linear, but that's how we think about it, is less of a "this versus that," and more "could we pick something we're going to work on, where that's how you win."

Lenny (01:12:48):
I think that's a really powerful insight, that for consumer software especially, and for commoditized consumer software especially, experience is a differentiator. You need to give people a reason to even try it, and then end up sticking with it when there's awesome alternatives. And so, just an obsession with the experience is a really smart strategy. If you get that right, people use it and continue to use it and you win.

Josh Miller (01:13:13):
I've seen this with a lot of ... And COVID is, I'm sure everyone listening, has a lot of the remote-work collaboration tools. A lot of them obsess, to their credit, over really interesting design details and product feature concepts that were imaginative and brought people together in new ways. And then the latency of the video of the audio audio was horrible, because they relied on some third-party API that was significantly worse than Zoom. And so, that's a great example where in that market, that category software, you better nail latency. I think a great example of this ... One of my favorite products these days, but past years is Tuple. It's ostensibly a paired programming tool that just lives in your menu bar. I'm not paired program with anyone. It is the fastest way to talk to someone at your company. And they have an unbelievably simple user experience.

(01:14:00):
The designer, based in Lyon, France, is incredible. It's a beautifully designed product. And it is the best audio quality I have ever experienced in a communication tool. Better than Zoom. So, that exact same product with all their craft details, sand latency, not going to do it. But also Tuple wouldn't have beat a lot of the other competitors for me if it wasn't unbelievably beautiful and easy and simple to use as well. So again, I think it's like, what are the attributes you need to win and picking a market that the ones that you want to excel at and work on, are key to that.

Lenny (01:14:34):
And also how much better you need to be. Like, if there's a 20% better than Chrome product, people are just going, "That's fine. I don't need to learn something new and everyone's using something else. I'm just going to have all these problems." So, you got to be significantly better. And that's a high bar for consumer products. Final question I wanted to touch on. You talked about the big vision for Arc and The Browser Company. And you mentioned this idea of the internet computer. And this is another question Scott Belsky suggested. By the way, Scott is the CPO of Adobe and just an awesome product-thinker person. And he just wanted to make sure that we touch on this, because I think there's a big idea here that maybe people don't realize. So, if you could just give us a brief overview of, what is just the actual vision and plan for The Browser Company and Arc, long term as a final question?

Josh Miller (01:15:19):
Yeah. So, we call it The Browser Company of New York almost as a misdirection, because as you know from the intro, we view Arc as a replacement for your default web browser, but we're hoping it will be much more. And so, to start at the highest level and bring it down to reality, one of the things that I've done many times in my career already is underestimate pretty foundational changes in how we use technology. I've appreciated them but underestimated them. Great example is mobile. I think me and Hursh's first company would've been much more successful if we really appreciated the tidal wave that was mobile. And I think one of those macro trends we're underestimating right now is the shift to cloud computing. The shift to the internet, which may sound weird because every big public company mentions Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. You hear about cloud, cloud, cloud and cloud. But again, that's this business term.

(01:16:13):
What I mean by the shift to cloud computing is, everything in our technology, in our computing lives is moving to the internet. It has been moving, but it's going to move even more. And what I mean by that is, your applications are almost all today web-based, internet-based applications. And they will all be soon. There's very, very few pieces of truly local-only software or even local-first software left. All of our files are moving to the internet, if they're not all already there. So if you really think about your files today, and again you ignore the word "files," the stuff you need for work in your personal life. They're not sitting on your desktop, they're all URLs. It may be an air quote "PDF," but that PDF is probably out on Dropbox somewhere and you're accessing it as a URL.

(01:17:03):
Your photos may seem like they're on your iPhone. They're not on your iPhone, they're on some iCloud server somewhere. When you get a new iPhone, they'll be right there. The manifestation of that actually is, if you smash your device that you're listening to this on right now, whether it's a phone or computer, other than being sad that you lost the resale value and there's a chore of replacing it and a cost of replacing it, you would not lose any of your stuff. So, imagine in five years our entire computing lives are not on our devices, on our computers, on our phones. They're out there somewhere. They're out in the internet, they're out in the cloud, which begs the question ... I remember when I was 10 and I got my first computer. It was a see-through iMac. And I wonder ... My son is two. When he's 10, what will his computer be?

(01:17:52):
And I mean computer not in the technical ... Again, going back to words and the words that we use. I don't mean computer in the literal sense of my MacBook Air, but computer in the human sense of, what you need from your computer, your stuff, your applications and tools that people ... Where is that going to be? Where is his computer going to be? I think it's obvious at this point that we're going to have airflow computers everywhere. We already do. My car has CarPlay, my TV is a computer, my laptop is a computer. I think that's going to be even more true in five years, where hardware is commoditizing. And it will commoditize even more. They're becoming empty shells that don't have anything on it. They're just vessels. They're just interfaces to viewing our real computer, which is out there on the internet somewhere. And so, our view is that what we are building at The Browser Company is an internet computer, is a air quote "computer," where the move to the internet and move to the cloud accelerates and continues the tsunami as much as we think it will.

(01:18:57):
And the way we represent that is, we say we want to be to the web browser, what the iPhone was to the cell phone. Yes. The iPhone replaced your cell phone, but it really was something much more. And so, we want Arc to be the iPhone for the internet, and that yes, it replaces your default browser. But whether or not we call it the internet computer or something else, it really is that interface, this new type of computer. If you play that one step forward, then what we're building today is, we're building our equivalent of multi-touch gestures and the first party-notes app. But, on any new computer, any computer or computing device, the developer platform itself is much more interesting and lucrative and world changing than the first-party computer itself. And so, we have no doubt that in the next decade, if we're successful, if we still exist, Arc as a development platform is going to be much more central to what we're doing, building on top of these internet computers, ours and others than anything else.

(01:20:00):
So to bring that down from reality. If you think about it, the internet, the web, is really the best development platform out there in many ways. It is accessible on every single device. It doesn't matter who makes it or the shape and size. It is free to access for individuals. You don't need money to access it. It's free for developers. You don't have to pay a license to use it. There's no 30% tax on what you make. And it's democratic. The best frameworks can win. And so, in many ways, if you were to say, "Hey, in this future we want to see, what is the platform that we should be developing on top of, what has the best attributes?" The web has that. And that's why you're seeing today. Why do you think Figma is in the web browser?

(01:20:41):
Why do you think Figma's blog post was "Meet us in the Web Browser"? Because as the development platform, developers cross platform in one click. There's no tax. Everyone should want to and wants to make for the web. The challenge, though, is there's an experience gap. Native software feels better for whatever reason. And the problem is the people that control our interfaces to this development platform that is the web, that is the internet, have incentives to keep it from being as good as local software, from truly native, immersive software. Apple? They don't want you making web apps or applications for the web. They want you making them for the Mac and the iPhone so they can taxi you when you do it through the app store. And also surprisingly, Google doesn't want you making stuff, more native and immersive for the air quote "Web," because they want it to be indexed by their search engine.

(01:21:37):
So, there's a reason that the Chrome extension platform is one of the most underutilized opportunities. They view it as a loss leader. They built chrome extensions just so they could have parity with Firefox. They don't want you making extensions, because you have some immersive extension experience that's not something that you could index in Google. And that's taking away from doing searches. And so, I think we look at this and say, everything is heading to the internet, which means we need interfaces to the internet that are truly more robust than a browser, that are more of a computer. And if we do that, then the most interesting opportunity on top of that is actually the things other people were built on top of this development platform. And if you look at this development platform, which exists today, the worldwide web, the open internet, what is missing is an interface and a set of capabilities and APIs to make web-based experiences as immersive and rich and powerful as native experiences, which require that interface to the internet to provide those.

(01:22:34):
And our interfacers to the internet today are the web browser companies. They have perverse business model incentives as big public companies that have lost the soul of the founders, that they don't want to do that. They don't want to do that. So it doesn't mean we're going to do it. And in fact one of them may win. And I actually think that this is something [inaudible 01:22:51]. We're trying to sell anyone in our vision. We feel fully confident there are going to be many types of internet computers and Arc may or may not be one of them. But we feel very confident that that is the future and the development platform on top of the web and the internet, and these new interfaces will be the most exciting opportunity.

Lenny (01:23:09):
My next question was going to be how do you make money with a browser, which people get for free, really well? And now it makes a lot more sense where y'all are going. And so, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Josh Miller (01:23:26):
Ready.

Lenny (01:23:27):
Okay. So, ready? What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Josh Miller (01:23:34):
Harold and the Purple Crayon, Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, which is a book about Robert Irwin. That's my number one PM book. So, if you're asking from the perspective of the disciplines of people listening, that book is absolutely fantastic. And then God Saved Texas by Lawrence Wright, who's one of my favorite authors, who if you're interested in road trips, politics, food, culture. So, three very different types of books.

Lenny (01:23:58):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Josh Miller (01:24:01):
The first TV show episode I've cried from in recent memories, episode three of The Last of Us. I thought I was watching a zombie violence thing and I just was sitting there bawling. So that one. And then I've been re-watching all of the Adam Curtis documentaries on YouTube. I'm a huge Adam Curtis fan.

Lenny (01:24:20):
I have not heard of Adam Curtis. I will have to go check that out.

Josh Miller (01:24:23):
Hyper-normalization is my favorite. And I would view his work as less non-fictional documentaries and more video art.

Lenny (01:24:32):
There's been a meme of everyone saying White Lotus is the show to watch. And I feel like it's about to transition to Last of Us. And so we will see how that goes.

Josh Miller (01:24:40):
Can I get it first? Was I the first guest to say it?

Lenny (01:24:43):
I think you might be actually. I forget, but I think you might be.

Josh Miller (01:24:45):
All right. Well, I'll say episode three, specifically.

Lenny (01:24:47):
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. People love that one. But every episode's awesome. Next question. Favorite interview question you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?

Josh Miller (01:24:56):
What would you like to ask me? That seems like a non-answer, but my interviews at Browser Company are all, "Ask me anything," and I find what people ask, and how they follow up, is as revealing about who they are and what they care about than anything I could ask them.

Lenny (01:25:12):
What is it that you look for in an answer that tells you, okay, this is a good candidate?

Josh Miller (01:25:17):
Authenticity, probably more than anything else. Do they really believe what they're saying?

Lenny (01:25:21):
Awesome. What are some SASS products that your company uses and loves, other than ... ? I don't know if you consider our SASS, but probably not. So, yeah.

Josh Miller (01:25:29):
I want to plug Tuple. I think I'm going to put everything on Tuple, relative to ... We run on Notion, we love Notion, we love Linear. But I'd say the closet hit that I just cannot believe is not a hundred times larger company is Tuple. It is ostensibly a pair programming tool, but don't go in with that mindset. Go in with, "I need to talk to a colleague right now," or "a couple of colleagues right now, to do some work together," and it is absolutely fantastic.

Lenny (01:25:58):
I love it. I love these products I've never heard of that are super cool. We will link to that. Next question. What's something relatively minor you've changed in how you build product, that has had a significant impact in your team's ability to ship and execute?

Josh Miller (01:26:11):
This past January, a couple months ago, we have started removing me from a lot of the product development process, which seems to be really healthy. So, that has been the big shift this year.

Lenny (01:26:22):
That's a big transition. I went through that at Airbnb and it's great. It's great for everyone. Final question. Best pro-tip for using Arc, that people may not be aware of?

Josh Miller (01:26:32):
Try your best to not think of it as a browser. And have a beginner's mind about how it works and how you might use the internet.

Lenny (01:26:40):
Whoa! Big idea.

Josh Miller (01:26:42):
Yeah. Big takeaway from this conversation, we got to get much better at describing what the heck we built. And why it's good for you. So, I'm not proud of my first or last answer, but it is what it is.

Lenny (01:26:54):
And, actually, I mentioned this in the intro and if you listen to this already, you probably heard it already, but we're going to link ... In the show notes, we'll have a link to actually get into Arc, because right now it's wait-listed and we have this link that will get you straight into Arc. And so go check it out. Josh, you've shown up with heartfelt intensity. I feel like I want to go apply for a job at The Browser Company now. But you're not hiring product managers, so I'm not going to do that. Just kidding. Thank you so much for being here, for being so genuine and insightful and warm. And thank you.

Josh Miller (01:27:29):
Thank you so much, Lenny. I really enjoyed this.

# Leveraging mentors to uplevel your career | Jules Walter (YouTube, Slack)

## Transcript

Jules Walter (00:00:00):
If you give me feedback, I'll be like, "Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful," because people are like, "Oh, he actually likes the feedback." Now, inside my heart might be melting. I'm like, "Oh, I thought I got better at this." You know what I mean? 

Lenny (00:00:14):
Yeah. 

Jules Walter (00:00:14):
But externally, I'm like, "Hey, thank you," and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.

Lenny (00:00:26):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Jules Walter. Jules is a product leader at YouTube. Before that, he spent four and a half years at Slack, where he was their first growth PM and then went on to lead their monetization teams and also their mobile team. He's also the co-founder and a board member of the Black Product Managers Network and CodePath, both of which are nonprofits that aim to increase diversity within tech. Jules and I have collaborated on a number of projects over the years, including a killer guest post on building product sense that continues to be one of the most shared and beloved posts in my newsletter. 

(00:01:04):
In our conversation, we focus on what skills matter most in advancing a PM's career, and more importantly, all the ways Jules has found to build those skills. We also go deep on mentorship, how to find a mentor, what to look for in a mentor, how to get someone to agree to be a mentor, and a lot more. I super enjoyed this conversation, which I'm sure you can tell. Jules is such a gem of a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Jules Walter after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:36):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful, and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod.

(00:03:49):
Jules, welcome to the podcast.

Jules Walter (00:03:52):
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm really excited.

Lenny (00:03:54):
I am even more excited. This chat has been a long time coming. I've been hoping to get you on this podcast ever since this podcast even launched. And then in the meantime, while we've been waiting to schedule it, a number of guests have mentioned how useful you've been to them in their career, and so I'm just really excited to finally have you on.

Jules Walter (00:04:11):
Yeah, same here.

Lenny (00:04:12):
Let's just start with a quick overview of your background. Could you share some of the wonderful places you've worked, some of the wonderful projects you've worked on, and then just a bit about what you're working on today?

Jules Walter (00:04:25):
Yeah, happy to. Some quick background, grew up in Haiti, studied computer science in college, went to business school. My first career was actually not in tech; it was in medical devices. I was a GM for a company based out of France and also overseeing West Africa business for them. After doing that, I moved back to the US, launched my own startup, which didn't work out, and then I moved to the Bay Area roughly eight years ago. In the Bay Area I wanted to become a PM, which was really hard to get into. At first, I joined a startup, series a company, became head of product for them, and then join Slack as the first PM on their growth team. Then from their, help scale the growth team at Slack. When I joined revenue was around 50 million; when I left roughly four years ago was 10x that. And then after Slack I recently joined YouTube Google about two years ago. At Google I'm a product lead at YouTube, where I'm driving a product called Primetime Channels, which actually recently launched in November in the US. And in that product, we're bringing streaming services to YouTube so that users can watch their favorite movies, shows, and sports content.

Lenny (00:05:35):
Amazing. The reason that I think we pushed this schedule of this podcast recording out is because you've been working on that product for many months and I'm glad to hear that it's finally launched. How did the launch go?

Jules Walter (00:05:45):
So far so good. It's really exciting to take a product from nothing to something. 

Lenny (00:05:49):
Especially at a company like Google.

Jules Walter (00:05:51):
Yeah. And then over time we are adding more exciting content onto the product. We just recently you announced that we're adding NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023 to primetime channels and also to YouTube TV. It's been a really exciting project.

Lenny (00:06:05):
That's awesome. I bet there's a lot of stories there, but I know you can't talk too much about what's happening at Google, so we'll move on. I like the point that you made about joining a startup, like you were trying to get into product management and you joined a startup as their first PM. I think you mentioned that's how you got into the PM path or I guess... Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's an interesting example of one of the paths into product management: joining a startup, getting into product there.

Jules Walter (00:06:27):
Not as their first PM, but I joined as one of their first PMs. Yeah. 

Lenny (00:06:31):
As one of their first PMs? 

Jules Walter (00:06:32):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:06:33):
That's something I hear often is just one of the paths to product management is join a startup, start doing product, and then you're a PM. And then you have a PM title on your resume and you can now join other companies. Is that something you found or anything you can take away from that experience?

Jules Walter (00:06:46):
Yeah. It's really, really hard to get into product and there isn't a really set path to do that. What I've seen is the path that we just talked about, join a startup and then from there go into different companies. And then the other path that is typical is being at a company and then switching product management, especially if you develop domain expertise and there's a need for a PM. So, that's even more frequent. Of course there's also acquisitions that sort of thing, but making that initial transition is really hard.

Lenny (00:07:19):
I didn't realize you were the first growth PM at Slack. That is a big role. How did that work out? How did you become the first growth PM at Slack? Was that the first time you're doing growth? What's the story there?

Jules Walter (00:07:30):
I joined Slack early 2016 and the role that was available at the time was growth. I did not know anything about growth, but I was like, "Hey, this is my way in at such a great company." So, that's what I joined to do. And then what I did there was really take a learning mindset and lean on mentors, and we can talk about that to really learn the practice of growth and applied for Slack.

Lenny (00:08:00):
Cool. We're definitely going to talk about some of those things. Just thinking about that experience and that ride at Slack, what's like maybe the most tangible memory or most, I don't know, interesting story of just riding that rocket ship of Slack growth as one of their early PMs?

Jules Walter (00:08:14):
There's many, many stories. My experience was I got in, didn't know much about growth, and then through mentorship, in particular, one mentor, Bangaly Kaba, sort of learned how to apply growth frameworks to my work. And then when I did that within six months, I was able to ship changes in the new user experience, especially on mobile. That moved the needle by a lot, like double-digit percentages within your [inaudible 00:08:38]. And we're talking about top line metrics like activation. It was just interesting being able to have such impact very quickly at a company, and then the company itself went through all these milestones. I mentioned I joined 50 million, the next thing it's a hundred, and it keep doubling, going through a public offering. So, there's just so many stories that are unique to hyper growth.

Lenny (00:09:01):
You also didn't mention in your background all these kind of extracurricular activities that you have. I've always been impressed with how much time you put into things that are kind of just volunteer projects on the side. Can you talk about some of the stuff that you do outside of your actual day job?

Jules Walter (00:09:15):
Outside of my work at YouTube now and also my family and young kids, I'm also involved with two nonprofits that I co-founded. Both of them are actually about improving diversity in tech, which is something I'm really passionate about. The first one is called CodePath and it's improving diversity for software engineers, and the second one is Black PMs focused on product management. With CodePath specifically, what we do is we train over 5,000 students every year at universities, typically the university with strong underrepresented populations, and we help them find internships and jobs at top tech companies. And then with Black PMs, we have a community of over a thousand PMs and aspiring PMs and then we help them find community and also grow their skills. Both of them are nonprofits that I wasn't actually setting out to build them. It's more like I had the need myself or I wish I had those sort of support when I was earlier in my career. And then I started helping folks and then one thing led to the other, especially my co-founders, and then these became big.

Lenny (00:10:22):
Sounds like a classic startup story, solve your own problem and turns into a larger and larger thing. I think I try to work with Black PMs as much as I can, and I know that you recently had a conference, which is so cool. I don't know, it was a really big conference that you organized. I don't know how you all had time for all that, but anything you can share about this conference and is there another one coming?

Jules Walter (00:10:42):
Now we have a really good team at Black PMs. The CEO, Brittany Bankston and the team, Benin Saffo and others, have helped put together that amazing conference that I was able to attend. It's amazing that it's hard for underrepresented community to see themselves in podcasts, at conferences, at speakers, that sort of thing. So, it gave that opportunity and it also enables us to realize that you're not alone. Because part of why I created Black PMs with my co-founders is... Actually, I'll tell you the story. 

(00:11:17):
I think it was around 2016, I was at a barbecue. I met another Black PM, Maryanna Quigless. I didn't know her and I was like, "Oh, you're a Black PM at Facebook. How many of you are there at the company?" And we're joking and we're like, "Hey, I bet we can list all the Black PMs we know." And we had basically roughly 15 between the two of us and we're like, "Hey, let's bring them all together in a room and to have a community." From there, started helping each other and that grew from 15 to now over a thousand.

Lenny (00:11:45):
Wow. Amazing. It's really inspiring, the work that you do. I don't know how you find time for all this. I love that you found ways to kind of delegate this and have other people run the program now.

Jules Walter (00:11:55):
Yeah. Now, I'm mostly on the board of these organizations. We have really solid teams for both Black PMs and CodePath, and the teams are just really amazing.

Lenny (00:12:03):
This touches on the stuff that I want to spend most of our time on our chat, which is around mentorship and just generally becoming a stronger product manager through all the ways you can become a stronger product manager. You mentioned you had a lot of great mentors. I've heard from other people, you've been a great mentor to them and you've also just been really successful at a number of really world-class companies. What I want to chat about is just, what have you found to be the most important skills to develop as a PM as you advance in your career, and then how to actually build those skills partly with mentorship, partly other ways? Maybe just to start, what have you found to be the most important skills in your career that have most helped you advance in your career and other PMs around you?

Jules Walter (00:12:50):
In terms of skills, I think of it in terms of two buckets. One are IQ skills, intellectual skills, like what sometimes people call hard skills. And then the other things are the EQ skills, oftentimes called soft skills. What I've seen in my career is that early on, I leaned more into the hard skills, the IQ stuff. That was what was most helpful to me. And then later on, I spent more time getting better at the EQ skills. The reality with PMs is that within each of these buckets, there's so many skills and then you can feel overwhelmed, so my advice is really just start skill by skill. What I did specifically is I joined Slack, I was in ICPM. When you join a new company, especially if you're earlier in the mid-career, you really want to get good at things like execution, IQ skills, execution, product sense, strategy. So, those were critical for me, especially my first year at Slack. 

(00:13:51):
The other skill that I'll also call out, which nobody talks about for some reason, is interview skills, because so much of what gives you a chance to become better as a PM is working at a great company. How you get that job beyond networking is actually becoming good at interviewing. If you think about my career, getting into Slack changed my trajectory and I was able to do that because I got slightly somewhat good enough at interviewing. I barely got the job and then I was really good at execution and got better at these other things, product sense, strategy, et cetera. In that phase, the things that I was working on, as I mentioned earlier, were things like improving user activation. So, it relies on those skills: identifying the opportunities, running experiments, executing quickly, and so on. That's the first set of skills.

Lenny (00:14:49):
Before we move on, and the second set is EQ, right? Is that where you're going? 

Jules Walter (00:14:51):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:14:52):
Cool. Maybe just one quick thread I want to pull on is this interviewing skill. That's really interesting. Your point here is you're not... And I think you're going to get to this of just how to get better at these skills. You mentioned one of the best ways is to be surrounded by amazing people who can help you get better at these skills, but you won't get there if you can't actually get into a company like Slack. Is there something you've found to be useful in building these interview skills? When you say interview, it's being interviewed, not interviewing other people, like passing these interview tests. 

Jules Walter (00:15:22):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:15:22):
Yeah. I guess what have you found has been most helpful in helping you become a better interviewee?

Jules Walter (00:15:28):
When people tell me, "Hey, I'm going to a interview at this company." First question I ask is, "How many mock interviews have you done?" And the answer typically is zero. It's, "Oh, I read a bunch of stuff. I practiced in my head." But I'm like, "How many actual mock interviews have you done?" And I would recommend people to do dozens of those mock interviews. Now, the other thing about practice is it's always better if you deliberate practice. If you mock interview with somebody who's actually good at interviewing, then you'll get better faster. But even if you don't do that, just going from zero mocks to practicing in your head to actually doing mocks with peers and others is going to get you to another level. And then the other thing I'll say is interviewing can be quite traumatic and difficult for a lot of people, even me. I mean before I got this job, I interviewed at Google, I don't know how many times, over the last decade or two.

Lenny (00:16:22):
Wait. You're saying you're interviewed at Google many times and you didn't get in then you kept looking for new opportunities?

Jules Walter (00:16:27):
Yeah. I graduated from MIT and I think even since internship times in '07, I'd interviewed for roles at Google and I didn't get those roles or Meta or various other companies. It's because I wasn't good at interviewing and I didn't know people at those companies. By the way, most things you do, people give you some feedback so you can get better at it, but interviewing you never get any feedback. That's the thing people don't talk about, but it's actually an important skill or a barrier to underrepresented folks.

Lenny (00:17:01):
To actually get feedback?

Jules Walter (00:17:02):
Yeah. You won't get feedback after an interview at any company.

Lenny (00:17:05):
That's a really good insight of just people see you join a YouTube and are like, "Oh, yeah, of course he's going to get into YouTube." But you're saying that you actually tried to interview and get into Google many times and it took a number of attempts and advancing your career a little bit before you actually... So, don't feel so discouraged if it doesn't work out. 

Jules Walter (00:17:23):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:17:24):
In terms of this mock, that's a really important point of just actually doing the interviews, like practicing, practicing, practicing. Not just reading questions but actually testing and practicing interview. If you were interviewed at a big company, there's a lot of videos out there of like, "Here's the questions they ask. Here's what they look for." And you're saying find people that work at the company and do these sorts of interviews with them. For companies that are smaller that maybe don't... It's not as obvious what they're going to ask you. Do you have any advice on how to find someone to do a mock interview with or how or what to actually be talking through?

Jules Walter (00:17:56):
Yeah, it's hard at smaller companies. However, I think interviewing even at bigger companies will help you [inaudible 00:18:04]. A lot of the times the bigger companies have more rigorous processes. So if you can do well there, then it is a bit easier elsewhere. But the key is really that practice part, which people overlook.

Lenny (00:18:18):
Cool. Well, maybe one last question there and we'll move on. Do you have any favorite resources or just advice of where to go find the questions to mock interview with and then who do you look forward to do these interviews with, like just find someone at the company or one of these larger companies that you respect to mock interview with?

Jules Walter (00:18:34):
I mentor a bunch of people who talk about various communities that exist out there. I can follow up on those, but there are large communities of people prepping for these companies. The key is really just being a part of a community and doing the mocks. And then the last thing I'll say on this is interviewing is hard and especially, I think, hard for underrepresented folks because it's high pressure. It's high stress, high ambiguity-

Lenny (00:19:02):
So much stress.

Jules Walter (00:19:03):
... coming into a company. I've gone into companies like an interview and then the whole panel, nobody looks like me. I walk into the cafeteria, nobody looks like me. And then you are interviewing and you have all this self-talk about, "Hey, do I even want to work there? Will I belong," while you're trying to solve complex problems. So, that's also the other part companies don't think about. What I do, like folks at Black PMs that I coach, is really help them find groups of people, like small groups. Let's say three of us, et cetera, three to five, and then you practice with that group who are going through the process. And because you like the people, then it makes it a bit more fun and it also can help you prep for your own nerves in those interviews.

Lenny (00:19:48):
What I'm hearing is, and I know we hear this all the time, if you're, say, a Black product manager, it's so much harder to not just get in because there's potentially bias at the company, but you're just psychologically not feeling as comfortable because nobody looks like you. You're worried that they're going to have bias against you. Is that what you find?

Jules Walter (00:20:07):
Yeah, that has been my experience and it's also what I hear from a lot of people I mentor.

Lenny (00:20:13):
Your advice there, and this is helpful to anyone also, is just practice even more because that's probably the best way to get over that as much as you can.

Jules Walter (00:20:21):
Yeah. You want to basically practice so much that even at your worst, you're good enough. I've always felt like most interviews, I literally did my worst. It's just that it was good enough to pass. You're so stressed out, you don't relate to the person, et cetera.

Lenny (00:20:38):
Got it. Okay. Let's go back to the question I asked that I pushed us away from. We were talking about what skills as a PM you want to be focusing on that mostly will help you in your career, and we started with IQ. I wrote a couple notes, so there's the concrete skills, execution, products and strategy, interviewing, and then there's a second bucket of EQ.

Jules Walter (00:20:57):
So, the IQ I already talked about. Those are the skills that help me at, especially in my first year at Slack, drive big good experiments, design good product experiences, and then drive results. But then what happened is as I get promoted, managed people and then start having larger scope, then there's a lot of ambiguity and stress that comes in with that increase in scope. And that's where the EQ stuff shows up a lot, specifically things like communications, because it's no longer my team. It's like cross-functional partners, other teams, executives, so you have to communicate all the time to different people. And then the other thing is things like leadership. Now, I'm driving initiatives that involve multiple teams, basic company level OKRs, and then the other thing too is beyond leadership, which is managing your team as well. How do you be a good manager? How do you deal with the ambiguity, stress? How do you influence various people? 

(00:21:58):
These are the EQ skills. What I've seen is, number one, it's much harder to learn these skills than the IQ stuff. The IQ is very intellectual. Sometimes, you just need a mental model, practice a bit. The EQ, I'm still learning these things. It's just like every... I'm trying to get better. Then the other thing beyond it being hard to learn is that the EQ stuff... What you need to focus on is specific to you, so you learn it. You probably work on something different than what I would work on versus if we're both trying to be better at strategy or execution, there's a lot more overlap. So, there's a lot of self-awareness that you need to have to know even what to work on and then you need to continuously practice it.

Lenny (00:22:44):
What did you find was the most important EQ skill for your career that helped you in this journey?

Jules Walter (00:22:50):
I don't know if there is one that single-handedly was the most important. I had to develop on many of these things. I can tell you, for example, communication is something that is helpful, especially as I become more senior. What happened for me is, early in my career, it was more about clarity and then conciseness. Then later it became more about how do you tell a story, and then also how do you communicate in an empathetic way. Specifically, you're telling the same story or presentation but to different audiences, and each time you have to adjust it because the CEO will care about this part, the CFO will care about this other part, and so on. I think that's one area where I spend a lot of time. And then the other thing also that has been helpful is the self-awareness part that I mentioned, where through mentorship, especially mentors who were very honest and help me see my blind spots, I was able to see my own patterns.

(00:23:54):
When I'm under stress, for example, I tend to withdraw and not see anything. So, then you might think I'm disengaged. By the way, in an interview context you might be like, "Oh, does this person even want to work here?" Then once you know these patterns you know, "Okay, I'm stressed right now, but I need to say something so that people see that I'm actually interested in this problem; I'm just thinking through it. Well, let me verbalize my thought process." So, that's me as an example. For you, it might be the opposite. The self-awareness piece has been really helpful and it's something I continue to work on.

Lenny (00:24:26):
That's an interesting point that it's important to understand how you react and to figure out what's unique about you that you want to be working on, especially within EQ. For this example you gave about how stress impacts you, how did you actually discover that? Was that this mentor just pointing out, "Hey, Jules, I've noticed this happens," or is there anything else there that maybe folks would find useful?

Jules Walter (00:24:47):
Generally, you need someone to put a mirror in front of you irritably. Sometimes, it's like you hire a coach, I talk to, and they see patterns. I've done group coaching too. In this case specifically, he was a mentor. His name is Lawrence Ripsher. He was head of product at Pinterest and became a mentor and now a close friend. One day I was preparing for... I think I need to do a representation and he was like, "Hey, I've noticed that when you are thinking, you're just quiet. Let me tell you what's going on in my own head when I see that." And then he was like, "Hey, I'm telling myself that he's not interested in what we're doing." And I'm like, "Really? That's the least thing." And then I realized that's a pattern I have. Over time, through him and others, I've also observed other patterns.

Lenny (00:25:38):
I missed this, but was he a manager or just a mentor you had within the company?

Jules Walter (00:25:42):
We didn't work at the same company. When I was at Slack, he was head of product at Pinterest. We met at a dinner and then from there, over time, he became a mentor and then we started meeting. When I would hit difficult situations, sometimes I would call him and ask for advice, and then through those interactions he's helped me identify some of my blind spots.

Lenny (00:26:08):
Okay, awesome. We're definitely going to talk about mentorship and how to work with a mentor, but let's kind of wrap up this EQ piece. You mentioned within EQ, skills to think about working on communication, leadership, and management. Is there anything else and then is there an example of one of these skills and how, I don't know, it helped you in your career or held you back until you figure out how to work on this?

Jules Walter (00:26:30):
High level, I think those buckets are pretty broad: comms, leadership, management. Within each of them, there are various skills like setting vision, strategy, listening to learn, those sort of things. It's actually the type of things that Matt Mochary talked about when he came to speak at your podcast. I mentioned communications was one thing, right? What happened was, when I was at Slack, I was pretty good at writing, which by the way I was terrible at long time ago. It took me years, maybe decade, to get better at. But then when it was time to present... I was fine at presenting, but then if you ask me questions, things would crumble. That even happened to me once at an interview, where I did well presenting and then they asked me a question and then I just gave an answer that wasn't good. 

(00:27:22):
Then the self-awareness part helped me figure out what was going on. For me specifically, I realized whenever people ask me questions, if I didn't know the answer, I would have all this negative self-talk and I basically... You'd ask me a question and of course it could be something like, "Why are we doing it this way?" And it might come from a place of curiosity, you're just like, "Hey, I don't know. Can you tell me why you have more context," right? But in my head I would hear, "I don't agree with this." And that would be my self-talk. "Oh, this person doesn't agree with this," instead of being present and trying to understand where are they coming from and maybe asking follow-ups like, "Hey, thanks for asking the question. Is your concern more about, I don't know, scalability of this approach or is it more that you don't think it's effective even if it's not scalable?" 

(00:28:10):
You know what I mean? For someone else, it might be the easiest thing, but for me it took me months and months to, first of all, figure out that I had this pattern. And then once I figured out the pattern, it took also a while to now actually act on it so that now I'm comfortable. If you ask me a question, sometimes I don't know and I'll say, "Hey, let me get back to you." Sometimes I don't know and I'll say, "Hey, I don't know, but here's what I'm thinking." This little thing that may seem so obvious to you took me a while and different people have different versions of these blockers.

Lenny (00:28:45):

(00:29:54):
I love these stories and this is a good segue to start talking a bit about not just what skills to focus on, but how to actually get better at these things and identify these patterns in yourself. There's like a bunch of skills we just named, so let's also talk about where you think you start as you're starting off as a PM, which skills to focus on first, second, third. Let me just ask this broad question. We've talked about all these different skills PM should have. What have you found to be most effective broadly at building these skills in your career?

Jules Walter (00:30:24):
I will share my approach. It might not work for everyone and later when we talk about strengths and weaknesses. You might see why that works for me. What I do specifically is when I'm trying to learn something new, I try to think about what is an outcome that I could drive. And if I drive this outcome, it will be proof that I'm better at this thing. If we go back to this story of when I joined Slack, I didn't know anything, literally anything about growth. And I was telling myself, "I hope they don't fire me." But then the outcome I wanted is, within six months, I wanted to ship enough experiments that were successful, that drove activation by, let's say, X percent. So, that's very concrete. 

(00:31:06):
Then once I have this outcome, I work backwards to figure out how am I going to do that. One of the things we can talk about later when we talk about strength is that, for me, I'm really good at asking questions. What I do then is I start asking questions like, "Okay, I'm trying to drive activation for Slack. What are some frameworks that I should use to drive activation? What are best practices? What are examples?" I have a sense of the kind of question that, if I were to answer them, I'd be able to drive the outcome. And then what I do is I read a little bit, not a lot about the topic, just to make sure I'm asking the right question. Then I refine my questions and then I find the best people in the field and I just go talk to them. That's where we'll talk later about the mentorship part. 

(00:31:54):
In the case of activation, I was like, "Okay, what's the company that defined growth?" At the time, Facebook. "Who are the people that I can reach out to that do growth at Facebook?" And one of them was Bangaly Kaba and also Adriel Frederick who spoke at your podcast. I had met both of them at a random event. Then I'm like, "I need to find a way to have a chat with these folks and to help answer those questions with them." So, that's what I did with Bangaly in particular and also Adriel to a certain extent. I then learned, "Okay, here are frameworks to use for growth." For example, understand, identify, execute. Spend a lot more of your time understanding why people aren't staying on Slack versus anything else, so then I had pointers. 

(00:32:40):
Once I have the pointers, then I try to go through the thing. I'm like, "Okay, now let me..." I call the user researcher, "Hey, can we do a research on people who are signing up on Slack?" Data analysts, let's look at the data. What correlates with activation?" Those sort of things. Then after I go through a look, where I actually see results, whether they're good or bad, I go back to the mentor and I'm like, "Hey, I did this. It was actually successful. Thanks a lot." Now, I'm thinking about this other problem." I keep going and that's how I rinse and repeat, and over time I drive the outcome and I also know I'm getting better at this thing by working with the experts.

Lenny (00:33:18):
There's a few interesting takeaways there. One, is that you kind of create a forcing function for yourself to learn a thing. It's like, "Hey, I'm going to learn this thing. Let's create a goal that my ass is on the line to hit and then that's going to force me to go figure this out." And then two, it's interesting how often you come back to mentors and other people around you helping you out, which is a really good reminder. You don't have to figure things out for yourself; there's people out there that know these things and they're happy to help. A question I want to ask and I'll save this, because I we're going to talk about mentorship specifically a little bit later, just like how to find these people. Not everyone has access to Bangaly and Adriel, and I'm curious just how you found these folks, how you recommend other people find folks like that. But that's an awesome example. One tactic you're talking about here is just work backwards from a forcing function you've created for yourself to learn a thing. And in this case, what was it you were trying to learn? You were trying to learn growth, is that right?

Jules Walter (00:34:11):
Yeah, I was trying to learn growth and I wanted to do it in a context of activation, like new onboarding. And then later I also wanted to learn growth but in a different context, which was monetization. How do you drive revenue growth, not just get more users? And then later it was things like, "How do I learn how to create a growth org? How do I structure my team? How do I set work streams that add up to a coherent strategy?" And you just keep going

Lenny (00:34:42):
In those examples, did you do the same thing, you found people to talk to? 

Jules Walter (00:34:46):
Yeah. Yeah. It's the same approach. Sometimes what happens is I have a few mentors that I just keep going to over the years and it's just a top exchange and sometimes I sort of get new mentors who are experts at these new topics. It's a combination of those two things for me. And the thing is you obviously can learn without this approach, but this approach makes you, at least for me, makes me learn so much faster.

Lenny (00:35:14):
That's probably one of the most interesting things I've learned about mentors, and you're touching on this, that people want to help. They're happy to help if people come ask, unless they're just dumb questions or they're just overwhelmed. People are generally very happy to help. People are always worried like, "Why would they spend any time trying to help me with this random thing?" It's really the opposite; they're happy to help.

Jules Walter (00:35:34):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:35:35):
Coming back to the EQ and IQ buckets, are there other examples of ways you've learned to improve, say, strategy, execution, product sense, things like that?

Jules Walter (00:35:46):
Whether you have a mentor or not, there's other things you kind of have to do. For me, for example, one thing I do is I try to identify what's the best practice for something. For example, let's say strategy. There was a phase where I got feedback, "Hey you need to be better at strategy." Then I'm like, "Okay. Well, can you help me understand what are people at this company that was awhile back, where you think have done a great job at strategy or what are examples of artifacts?" Then I get these artifacts and I reverse engineering them. I try to think, "Okay, what are the top questions, the answer? Maybe I'm not answering all these questions. How do they do it?" And you start seeing the patterns like, "This person did it in a memo, this person did it in a deck." So, it's not about the format, but what is it about? Then this person had a lot of data, this person is quantitative, qualitative. So, that's a big part of what I do as well. It's true for all these things. 

(00:36:47):
For execution, it would be things like me attending another PMs meeting. "Oh, I heard this person is amazing at executing. Let me just see how they're on a meeting." And then you're like, "Whoa, things we didn't notice." Or somebody is great at communicating and I'm like, "Okay. Well, did you send this email? It's great. Let me save it." I'd have docs where I saved templates of things, and a lot of the reason, I think, people don't learn through osmosis that way is because one is you're not at a company where you can see great artifacts sometimes. That's why I mentioned if you can get a better company, do that. The other thing, too, is even if you see the greatness around you, some people don't try to break it down, to understand: "Why is this one great and not that one?" So, I actually do spend a lot of time every week reflecting like, "Oh, I saw these docs that were great or I saw this presentation this person gave." I sometimes crash presentation audits PMs give to executives, just to see how they handle questions or these sort of things. A lot of it is just spending time observing as well.

Lenny (00:37:54):
I love this advice, it's so powerful. Just like, "Who is amazing at this skill? And let me just go watch them and learn from them."

Jules Walter (00:38:01):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:38:02):
Something that you touched on here is, and I talk about this a bunch, that one of the benefits of working at a large company like Google, like Slack, is that you have access to a ton of real examples of strategy documents and vision documents and roadmaps and things like that, that once you're out of a company, like me, nobody shares these things publicly because they're sensitive. One of the best benefits of working at a large company is they have access to real life strategy documents, vision documents, things like that, so you should really savor that and collect them and, to your point, just study them. And I love your advice of just working backwards from like, "Okay, here's a strategy that work. What is it about the strategy that I can use when I'm building my strategy? What questions are they answering? How are they structuring it?" Things like that. That's awesome.

Jules Walter (00:38:48):
Similar to the mentor point, people are actually happy to talk to you. They're even flattered because no one else asked them. "Well, hey, I read your doc. Can we talk about it?"

Lenny (00:38:54):
Right. Whoever gets the... What PM ever gets someone coming to them? "I love your strategy doc. Tell me all about it. I'd love to talk about that."

Jules Walter (00:39:06):
Yeah. And then the other thing I'll say, too, is a lot of learning happens through the iterations and not by seeing the final product. We all see these products, like the iPhone and name your favorite product, but you don't know what versions they tried and sort of eliminated. And that's the benefit you also get at a company that has great product management. I actually sometimes tell the PM like, "Hey, don't just show me the one you just did. When are you going to do your next strategy? Can I join you then? I just want to sit and watch you write down the outline and just understand your thought process," or "I want to see when you're going to write your next exec update and understand how are you..." And you see them go through these iteration and you see them do things like get feedback that you didn't know they were getting all this feedback from. So, seeing the backstage is also really helpful.

Lenny (00:39:58):
It's interesting. Just as you're talking, I'm reflecting on how many benefits there are to working at a world class company. You are surrounded by really smart people who you can talk to and ask for advice and watch how they operate. You have access to really incredible documents and artifacts that you can learn from. Also, just the logo on your resume is really powerful for future job opportunities, which then comes back to the interview skills that you talked about and how important it is to be good at that to get into a company like that.

Jules Walter (00:40:24):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:40:25):
Interesting. Okay. What about on EQ? Any examples of how you learned some of those skills that you talked about communication or leadership or management or anything along those lines?

Jules Walter (00:40:36):
Yeah. On the communications side, I read some stuff like Minto's Pyramid Principles. Extremely helpful and I know you had an article on that. 

Lenny (00:40:44):
Mm-hmm.

Jules Walter (00:40:45):
I mentioned also that whenever I see a great email exec update or whatever, I literally save it in a special folder.

Lenny (00:40:54):
I love that.

Jules Walter (00:40:55):
Also, by the way, I always ask for feedback more than I think many people and I try to see patterns in feedback. For me, one thing I've observed is I tend to write long sentences, coming from a Haitian-French background, but then I see that because I've seen enough feedback that are about it so I see the patterns. Or as I mentioned earlier, I used to not be clear like, "Are you saying this solution or that solution?" It's better sometimes to be wrong but clear than the other way around. That's on the comms side. And then the other things, it's mostly, for me, through mentorship, people like Lawrence helping me be real with myself. I've had a coach for a while and I also do group coaching, which I really love. Right now I'm doing group coaching with a company called Pathways to Leadership.

(00:41:48):
These sort of things have helped me infer what my strengths and weaknesses are and then work on them. And then one thing I'll say also about the EQ: it was the most frustrating learning for me. For the IQ stuff, within six months, sometimes three months, I can see clear progress when you see enough documents. You see five, six of them, you start seeing 80% of the patterns. But then with the EQ stuff, it's things I've been working on for years. I am better at them, but I still feel like I'm continuing to work on those things. And a lot of it is like lifting weights or building muscles; you have to do it every day or every week. And then if you stop doing it, over time you atrophy again. That's something that people need to acknowledge, too. Give yourself time and then also learn these skills one at a time ideally.

Lenny (00:42:45):
Oh, interesting. Can you talk a bit more about that learning skills one at a time? Is your approach just like, "Here's the thing, I'm working on this the next six months. I'm going to focus on that."

Jules Walter (00:42:53):
Yeah. My approach is typically I'll say, "I'm giving myself, I don't know, three months, six months." It depends on what [inaudible 00:43:00] I want to see in my behavior for these things and then I just go all in on that skill. Let's say I wanted to learn strategy, I'll be like, "Okay, I'm giving myself, let's say, six months." Every week, I'm going to do something related to learning strategy. It's going to be maybe I read the strategy for another feature product at my company and you just divide, right? Let's just say there's 10 features or 20, it doesn't matter. You just do one a week, so 20 weeks. You see what I'm saying? And then the other thing is, every week I'm also going to practice it towards my outcome. I'm going to spend, I don't know, three hours a week, maybe one hour a day, just thinking through my own product strategy. And I do that for six months. You do it enough that you get over the hump and then actually develop the skill. Now, the other approach you could take is... What most people do is they read an article on your newsletter or some other place and then like, "Oh, great. I learned an insight." And then you go back to usual.

Lenny (00:44:00):
And it's not like at the end of these six months, you're done. I'm strategy expert, I am good on strategy. To your point, it's building this muscle that will never be fully built. It just will get stronger. And every time you invest time learning something, it gets stronger.

Jules Walter (00:44:15):
Yeah, exactly. It's not that within six months you are clearly better. Now, you can invest another six months to get to the next level. Or you could say, "Now I'm going to switch focus to another skill and get that one to a similar level."

Lenny (00:44:28):
Is there a skill you're working on right now?

Jules Walter (00:44:30):
Always working on something. One I can call out is listening. One thing about the EQ stuff, too, by the way is you hear these words, and depending on how familiar you are, you understand or don't understand what it actually means. When I say listening, I'm good at seeking information to solve a problem. If you come to me and you're like, "Hey, Jules, I have this problem," I will know what to listen for and what to ask you. "Hey, Lenny, can you tell me A, B?" And then I'll help you solve the problem. However, there's also different listening patterns, one of which is you just create space for someone. It's not like you're seeking a particular information, just give them space to tell you what they want to tell you. And then the other side of it, too, is you help that person feel heard, "Hey, I feel like you actually understand me and you've heard what I'm saying." So, that's the part I am working on.

Lenny (00:45:25):
You mentioned the Matt Mochary episode. I imagine you've been listening to that, because that has a lot of great advice.

Jules Walter (00:45:29):
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's those kinds of things, right? And then he talked about saying back to people what you heard, asking for more information, et cetera.

Lenny (00:45:38):
Awesome. You mentioned that you asked for feedback from your peers, and I wrote that down. I wanted to double-click on that a little bit. How do you actually approach asking for feedback? Do you sound like a survey? Do you just ask people in meeting? How do you do that?

Jules Walter (00:45:51):
The feedback piece, it's something that I had to get better at. Over time, I'm asking for it, because what I realize is if people don't feel comfortable with you, they won't give you feedback. It's depending on the risk, right? Especially if it's constructive feedback. By the way, that's also something that's hard about being underrepresented. People sometimes don't have the same natural level of connection with you. I basically learned to go out of my way to make people comfortable giving me feedback. There's different techniques and Matt Mochary also talks about some of them. Sometime it's basically ask in a very specific way, "Hey, I did this presentation. I'm working on, I don't know, having more executive presence. Did you feel that? To which extent did you feel that I showed executive presence?" So, it's a very specific thing versus, "Hey, how did it go?" That's one thing you can do. 

(00:46:45):
Other thing you can do sometimes is you give yourself critical feedback in front of them and then you give them a chance to agree or disagree. "Hey, I feel like this presentation didn't go well for this reason. What do you think? But actually I thought it would've been fine; however, this other thing could have been better." And then the other thing I'll say that is very, very important if you're asking people for feedback is if you manage to get them to take the risk to give you the feedback, your answer has to be enthusiastically grateful. That's the key. What people knew at Slack, Google, et cetera, is if you give me feedback, I'll be like, "Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful," because people are like, "Oh, he actually likes the feedback." Now, inside, my heart might be melting. I'm like, "Oh, I thought I got better at this." You know what I mean?

Lenny (00:46:45):
Yeah. 

Jules Walter (00:47:42):
But externally, I'm like, "Hey, thank you," and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't sort of focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.

Lenny (00:47:51):
That is such a good advice, all these very tactical ways of getting actual real feedback from people.

Jules Walter (00:47:55):
Yeah. And then one thing I'll say, too, by the way, it's harder to get feedback on the EQ stuff, and that's also why it's harder to develop and why a lot of people reach terminal levels in product, because people are like, "Oh, they lack emotional intelligence." They say that in calibration rooms but not in your face, so that's also what you want when you hear feedback. You don't want just to like, "Hey, here's my piece of feedback that I can prove." You also want the part that is like, "Here's how you make me feel or how you come across that... If this is taken out of context, it won't be good for... I don't want this to be shared publicly or taken out of context, but I want you to know." And it could be things like, "Hey, when I talk to you, sometimes I feel like, I don't know, you're angry." And then I'm like, "Oh, really? In what scenario?" And then it's like, "Oh, I was so focused and listening to you intently that I could see now why I come across that way." 

(00:48:55):
But you could literally go your whole career and then nobody ever says these things, right? And that's the kind of feedback that I personally find most helpful is the subjective feedback, because nobody will tell me those things. Once somebody I trust tell me and I'm like... Oh, here's an example. I mentioned earlier I'm good at asking questions. I had somebody ask like, "Tell me. Hey, sometimes when you ask questions, you sound more junior." And I was like, "Huh." And then I can see that because I asked the question plainly like, "Hey, why did you do this or how did you that," instead of also saying where I'm coming from, "Hey, I noticed this blah, blah, why, blah?" You know what I'm saying? Instead of showing I have an understanding of the thing and then asking a follow-up question, I just ask the question bluntly without context and people feel like, "Hey, I'm asking a very basic question." So, that's the kind of feedback that I particularly value.

Lenny (00:49:48):
The feedback you're getting is pretty incredible, like the stuff you shared about someone saying you come across as angry in a meeting if you ask questions or you sound a junior. I don't know if I've ever gotten anyone to give me that brutally honest feedback. When those specific cases, what was it about these people that helped them give you this feedback? Is that what you talked about, you built trust with them over the years or is there something you did to get that kind of feedback?

Jules Walter (00:50:10):
I mean, it's definitely they trusted me and they cared about me. They trust that if they tell me the feedback without translating, that I would see the intent behind it. And they were able to do that, because after months and years of working together, they know how to respond to feedback. Because what happens is most people, when you have to get feedback, you kind of have to really do a lot of translation work so that it lands, "I don't want to hurt your feeling. I don't want you to take this." I just told people, "You don't have to that with me." That's one. And then the other thing, too, is people reciprocate also how you talk. I'm not saying I talk to people like this, but I try to be vulnerable with people so they know we can be vulnerable and things are safe like, "I really want to hear things the way you experience it."

Lenny (00:50:59):
Got it. So, there's a lot of foundation setting that you do to create this environment where people are like, "Jules, here's something that's going wrong. You can work on this." 

Jules Walter (00:51:05):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:51:06):
That's an awesome takeaway. One other thread I wanted to pull on is you mentioned focusing on strengths and how that ends up being really important. Something I'm a big believer in is focusing on strengths versus trying to make your weaknesses much, much stronger. Is there any advice you can share to better understand what your strengths are, why that's an approach to take in developing your skills?

Jules Walter (00:51:28):
For the strengths, breakthroughs. For me, a lot of it was talking to my mentor, Lawrence Ripsher. And I organized this event for Black PMs at Pinterest, where Lawrence was speaking, and then we were talking about, "Hey, watch should we talk about, et cetera." I don't know how, but in the conversation he talked about doubling down your strengths more than on fixing your weaknesses, and then he used me as an example. Then the fun part is he had this approach of how you actually find your strength. It's a very simple question, where basically he's like, "Hey, what is something that a lot of people say you're good at, but you think it's not a big deal or it's not that important?" And that's the key. I always that's what resonated with me. I was like, "Oh, a lot of people keep saying I'm really good at networking."

(00:52:26):
I'm like semi-introvert, so I'm like, "Hold on, I don't know." [inaudible 00:52:32] not everyone or people will tell me, "Hey, you have asked great questions." And I'm like, "I asked basic questions." And then he helped me understand, "Actually, that's how you know it's a strength." Now, what you need to figure out is how do you get more out of that strength. An analogy, by the way, is imagine that you saw a fish and you were like, "Hey, you're really good at swimming." And then the fish would be like, "Oh. Duh, doesn't everybody swim?" And so, that's the key and I invite people to think about that question like, "What's something people keep telling you you're good at, but you yourself don't think is a big deal?" And that's how I was able to find a bunch of my strengths. ]

(00:53:09):
For me, generally I'm thoughtful, ask great questions. I also simplify problems a lot. I mean, we work together on a product sense article, which is a very complex thing, made it more simple. And then once you identify the strength, then it helps to also think about why are you good at this thing? Because that's the underlying resource that you have. A big part for me is I'm actually quite curious. And fun fact, I don't think of myself as curious, but people keep telling me I am. And even my mom was telling me when I was a kid, I used to always try to unscrew toys to see how they work in the inside. That's one thing: being curious help me ask the questions and so on. And then the other thing, too, is once you have the strength, you want to understand the shadow side of it, and that's the connection between your strength and weaknesses.

(00:54:02):
That was a key breakthrough for me, especially Lawrence helped me understand that. Strengthen and weakness, it's not a binary thing. It's like the same thing, but it's a dial. In some context it's good, in other contexts it's serving you. An example in my cases is... I talked about I ask great questions, but sometimes I ask a question without context, I might come across as less knowledgeable. Or another thing for me is I'm able to take very complex problems and then create a mental model that's much simpler, whether it's growth or other things. But until I come up with that mental model, if I'm in a meeting with you, I won't talk much about that topic. Basically, I'm more quiet than other people when people want to hear my point of view because I'm just listening and trying to create a mental model of the situation. You're seeing how the same strength is perceived as a weakness depending on context. And once you have that... For me, I feel more empowered. I'm like, "Oh, I just have to dial down a little bit here or dial a little bit here," and I also know this thing is serving me, which is why I keep doing the bad side of it.

Lenny (00:55:10):
Awesome. This all often comes back to mentors in your life. I want to get to talking about mentorship and how you find your mentors, how you work with them, all that kind of stuff; something we've been touching on a bunch and I'm excited to begin to. Maybe to start, can you just talk about some of the mentors you've had in your life, some of the most impactful mentors that you've had?

Jules Walter (00:55:35):
I've definitely had a large number of mentors over the years. Fun fact, when I came to the area eight years ago, I didn't know anyone.

Lenny (00:55:42):
Wow.

Jules Walter (00:55:43):
It took a while to build those relationships. I talked earlier about Bangaly Kaba who sort of helped me figure out how to grow Slack even though he wasn't working outside, but helped me have the frameworks. I talked about Lawrence Ripsher. He helped me discover my strengths and also how to lean into them. Aaron Teague is another friend and mentor who brought me to Google, actually. And there's also Bradley Horowitz, former VP of Google Photos, also helped me in terms of how do you think about leadership and so on. Many other folks, Nikhyl Singhal, VP at Meta helped me with PM career. So, lots of mentors for sure.

Lenny (00:56:23):
Okay, that's the killer list. Two questions. One, what do you look for in a mentor when you're trying to find someone to work with? And then two, how do you actually find these people? Most people listening are like, "Wow, I would love an amazing mentor to help me in my career. I don't know how to find one." What advice do you have for folks to finding a mentor?

Jules Walter (00:56:41):
I look for two things. One is, are you good at one specific thing I'm trying to get better at? And then two is, are you good at explaining it? Those two, at least for me, they're important. I know people are really good at their roles, at their job and at the subject, but they don't actually know how they do it or they don't really want to explain or cannot explain easily. So, that's what I look for. And then in terms of where I find these people, it's really everywhere. If you look at the list I mentioned earlier, Bangaly I met at an event. Facebook had a recruiting event, I showed up, I see this guy, I'm like, "Oh. Hi." Chat a little bit. I talked about Lawrence, who's now a close friend. I met Lawrence at a dinner. He organized a dinner for underrepresented PMs, we chatted, one thing led to the other, and then he became a mentor and friend. Bradley was at a fundraiser. And Nikhyl was an intro via email. Somebody was like, "Oh, you should meet Nikhyl." 

(00:57:41):
I know this sounds counterintuitive. I don't think the hard part is where to find them; it's more about finding the right person and then how do you get a foot in? Now, what I've seen... A lot of people, sometimes they get mentors who are too senior or who don't actually think about the topic they're interested in. Maybe they did five years ago, but once you find the right person, the key is like, "How do you have that initial conversation? How do you get the foot in the door?" And what I've found is you should make the smallest ask possible, which is the opposite of what 95% of people do. 95% of people is like, "Hey, I've never met you, but I heard your talk or I saw you on LinkedIn or whatever. Can we set up a call?"

(00:58:29):
That's like a big ask. What I do... For example, there's this person who came to Slack, he was head of product of a major company and then he gave a talk about different methods to improve products. He had this concept of finding the heat for products. He spoke at the company, I got his email, and I reached out in the evening and I was like, "Hey, thanks so much for speaking today. We talked about finding the heat for products. Is there an example of product that you think was created with this approach?" Something he could answer in literally two minutes via email? That was my question. It wasn't like, "Hey, you talked. Now, I feel entitled to meet with you." But then the key is once you get that foot in the door, it could be a quick email, a tweet, a quick chat at an event, that sort of thing, and you get some advice that's useful, the key is to circle back with them at a later point and show that you've actually made good use of the advice. 

(00:59:30):
I think that's the thing nobody does. What I would do... For example, there's currently the CEO of a top tech company I met an event. She spoke there and then she gave some advice that was useful. I emailed her a follow-up type thing and then she gave me advice about how to rethink the mission statement for my nonprofit, all via email. Then at some point I was like, "Hey, I've applied your problem trend competency framework to crafting the mission for my nonprofit. Here's where we landed. That was super helpful. Thank you so much." Replies back. And then what I would do then later is maybe a month later or two months, X months later, I can reach out again for another problem and maybe I could say, "Hey, this time it's a little bit more nuanced. Can we grab 15 minutes?" And the person was like, "Yeah, sure." That person was very, very busy. I was like, "Hey, let's do it." And then over time we become Facebook friends, that sort of thing, but that's the approach I take.

Lenny (01:00:29):
That's such a good advice. It reminds me of Tim Ferris's advice also, which is just like, "Don't go up to someone and be like, 'Will you be my mentor?'" Everyone's going to be like, "I don't have time for that." Instead, to your point, it's the exact opposite. Just start asking simple questions and then over time build up relationship, and then over time, maybe you start meeting regularly. But don't start big; start small.

Jules Walter (01:00:50):
You. As small as possible.

Lenny (01:00:53):
It's not like you just have one mentor. You've listed a whole bunch of people that have helped you over your career. It's not like, "Here's the person, they have to be perfect." It sounds like you kind of identify, "Here's a skill or an area I want to focus and this person is going to be really good at that." 

Jules Walter (01:01:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:07):
Then I also just love the point about it feels really hard to find an amazing mentor. From what I'm hearing, the main thing you do is just go to things, attend events, basically go events, meet people, right? That's kind of the foundation in which you're sharing is just meet as many people as you can, and amongst that group, you'll find people that are probably going to be helpful.

Jules Walter (01:01:26):
Yeah. And I understand it can be harder for some folks. I mean, now I have two young kids, so I don't do as many events. I've also met quite a few people through introductions, sometimes being cold outreach. I had a chat with Shishir through cold outreach [inaudible 01:01:44] a very clear question, and then he offered to come to Black PMs and share some insights. Those kinds of things happen, too, but you have to show the person that you're going to make really good use of their time. You have to give really specific contexts like, "Hey, let's grab coffee." It's like, "Hey, here's a very specific question. Can you share some thoughts or point via email?" And then they might offer, "Hey, why don't we just talk?" That sort of thing, too. Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:09):
That works really well. Anytime I get an email request of, "Hey, could we do a 15-minute Zoom or a copy chat," I quickly do not have time for that. But an actual question that I can be really helpful with really quickly, that's so much easier, so that makes a lot of sense. The next thing I wanted to ask you is: how do you build and continue this relationship? And then once you actually start engaging regularly, what do you suggest folks talk about in these meetings if they're ongoing.

Jules Walter (01:02:37):
I make sure to bring something very specific that I'm dealing with where they can provide input. And this is the opposite of what many people do where they're like, "Hey, can you tell me about how you... Whatever, your path to PM," which may or may not be relevant to them, versus, "Hey, I've interviewed for three companies. I'm trying to decide among those three. Can I walk you through my thought process and get your feedback?" So, it's very different. I definitely make sure I bring a very specific context, and sometime it could be... I mentioned the example of Bangali like, "Hey, I'm now a growth PM at Slack. I'm trying to improve activation. Can I talk to you about how you approach growth in general?" Or it could be, "Hey, I'm having internal..." Let's say I have internal mentors at Google and I have a few, then it's like, "Hey, I'm about to have this negotiation with this team. Can I walk you through my thought process and hear your advice?" So, it's very specific things. 

(01:03:37):
And then the other thing I'll say, too, is when I talk to mentors, I always take notes. I mean, I'm seeing you even here in this interview. You're taking notes. These are basic things people don't actually think about it sometimes. And then when I follow up, whether it's via email or in person, I bring up older conversations. It's like, "Hey, remember last time we told about X? I did it," or "Hey, how's your daughter? I know she was going to college this semester. How did that go?" So, it always feels like a continuation of a conversation and it feels like an actual relationship instead of transactional interactions. And then the other thing, too, is I try really hard to identify ways that I can be helpful. Sometimes, at the end of chat I'll be like, "Hey, is there anything I can help you with? Anything top of mind for you?" And sometimes the person could be senior or wealthy, doesn't matter, and they're like, "Actually, yes. I'd love to better understand how the team is really doing. Nobody will tell me the truth," or "Hey, I am trying to hire for this role. You have [inaudible 01:04:43] Black PMs. Do you mind sharing?" There's always ways you can help, but most people are so focused on themselves that they miss out on these opportunities.

Lenny (01:04:52):
The point about coming back to the person and sharing what impact their advice had and how it went is so good, because to your point, it just feels like you're sharing all this advice and just isn't going anywhere. And then note-taking, such great stuff. This is really good advice. I could see how it would work on me if someone's asking me for advice.

Jules Walter (01:05:10):
By the way, I mean we didn't know each other two years ago, right?

Lenny (01:05:10):
Yeah, that's right.

Jules Walter (01:05:14):
Yeah. It's like a similar process, where we got to know each other mostly via email and led to the other, and we try to help each other.

Lenny (01:05:22):
And look at us now. Any final thoughts before we wrap up and head to our very exciting lightning round?

Jules Walter (01:05:31):
I have found the process of learning how to be a PM very difficult and I also find it quite rewarding. And I want to set expectation, especially for people who are early in their career, people may be frustrated by the process, because you have all these skills. We listed, I don't know, half a dozen, a dozen that you want to get better at. So, be patient. Then also it takes a while to see massive differences, but once you see those differences, you set yourself apart from your peers. That's one thing. And then the other thing, too, is it's really building muscles more so for the EQ stuff, but even for the IQ stuff. You have to practice. It's not just read Lenny's top 10 articles for two hours and then you're good. Read them, do what they say, get feedback after you do what they say and say like, "Huh, it worked for me. It didn't work for me." Reread them again, find mentors, et cetera. It's a long process and I don't think people have that mental model around how to learn in general, but also specifically how to learn the PM skills.

Lenny (01:06:41):
And I imagine there's also this one step forward, two step back experience that often happens, too, where you're just like, "Oh, I thought I figured out how to think about strategy, and this one failed." And you're like, "Oh, that was useless." No, this is how you learn. You fail sometimes. Oftentimes, it works out slowly but surely you move forward.

Jules Walter (01:06:57):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (01:06:58):
Amazing. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Since we've gone a little long, I'm going to keep it just four questions. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast, whatever comes to mind. Fire off. You ready? 

Jules Walter (01:07:10):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:07:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jules Walter (01:07:15):
One of them is Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss. It's about negotiations. There's actually also a masterclass on it.

Lenny (01:07:21):
I was just going to say that. I watched that. That was really good. 

Jules Walter (01:07:24):
Yeah. Yeah. And then another one is Connect by Carole Robin. It's inspired by Stanford's Touchy-Feely class, if you've ever heard of it.

Lenny (01:07:33):
Yeah. She did a guest post for the newsletter, actually.

Jules Walter (01:07:35):
Oh, really? Awesome. Yeah. It's really a helpful especially as you are thinking about the EQ skills and how to improve your relationships with people.

Lenny (01:07:44):
Awesome. I highly recommend that book. I haven't read it, but I read a lot of things about the class and my friends have been in that class and she wrote this guest post. That sounds like a really good pick for EQ, so I'm actually going to re-pick it up. Next question: favorite other podcast that isn't this podcast.

Jules Walter (01:08:02):
Lex Fridman is one I'll call out. Brings really interesting speakers and also on diverse topics, so I find it really helpful.

Lenny (01:08:11):
Awesome. I also love that podcast. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jules Walter (01:08:15):
I watch fewer now. Top Gun: Maverick is a movie I really like. I'm sure many people have seen it. For me, it's like just going back in the 80s. And then TV show is Never Have I Ever. It's coming of age in America, Indian teenager. Pretty funny and also deep.

Lenny (01:08:34):
Awesome. I haven't heard of that one. We'll check it out. Final question: favorite interview question that you like to ask folks when you're interviewing them?

Jules Walter (01:08:41):
One I used to ask a lot is: what's something work related that you're trying to get better at? Sometimes I change the wording of it, but a big part of it is trying to understand how self-aware people are, to which extent they have a growth mindset, and then also how honest and vulnerable they can be. What I will say, though, about interview question, by the way, is I don't anchor a lot on the first question. What I find the most value from are the follow-ups. Once you ask that question, you can take in various directions like, "Why did you focus on this versus other things? How did this come to your attention? Was it feedback you sought or feedback people gave you, et cetera?" Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:24):
Awesome advice. Jules, this interview was a longtime coming. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you? 

Jules Walter (01:09:39):
In terms of finding me, Twitter is one place to start. My handle is @julesdwalt. And then in terms of how people can be useful, it's really about paying it forward and then sharing this with others, especially parts that people find useful.

Lenny (01:09:55):
Amazing. Jules, thank you so much. We'll chat again soon.

Jules Walter (01:10:00):
Yeah, thanks for having me.

# M&A, competition, pricing, and investing | Julia Schottenstein (dbt Labs)

## Transcript

Julia Schottenstein (00:00:00):
M&A is always about creating plan Bs. And the way I would think about it is for any one company, there's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic. And the strategy that I would do in how do you get noticed is I would figure out the area that you bring a competitive advantage. And I would inflict pain on that potential buyer. Make it impossible for them to not notice you because that's when they're going to have their ears perk up and say, "Well, what's going on with this company?"

(00:00:33):
The really important piece here is you want to do that in a way that's still friendly and open. I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely will shut down a conversation or they won't talk to an incumbent or a potential future buyer because they take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs and you don't want to shut that door down prematurely because you don't know if you can really go the distance and be an independent company. So you want to have optionality.

Lenny (00:01:04):

Julia, welcome to the podcast.

Julia Schottenstein (00:04:17):
Super excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:19):
So you have a really interesting career path in that you went from VC into product management. Usually it's the other way around. Usually PMs become VCs and it's right to see this version of it. So I wanted to start with just a question of just how did that come to be?

Julia Schottenstein (00:04:34):
I do have an unusual background, but it doesn't surprise me that people who are interested in product are also interested in investing and vice versa. For me, I've always had three interests broadly and that's an interest in business, an interest in technology and an interest in markets. And I get to express those interests both in investing and in product, but just with different weights. So in product you go a lot deeper on the tech and markets is less of a focus, but you still get to do all three. So I have a unusual background and I used to be a professional investor at NEA. Spent all my time investing in early stage startups that built for technical audiences. So think dev tools, infra data companies.

(00:05:22):
And in 2019 I first discovered dbt, which was an open source data transformation framework. And I got really very, very excited about dbt because when I talked to people that were using it, the way that they described their experience on dbt was like unlike anything I had heard before. It was much more of an identity for them than just a tool that they were using to get their job done. And that really struck me. And as I thought about what was happening in the market, there was a lot going on in 2019. The markets were changing quite a bit. Cloud data warehouses were starting to explode. This was the year where Snowflake went from a 4 billion company to a 12 billion company. And I thought to myself, if dbt worked, it could work in a really extraordinary way. And I naturally tried to spend all my time getting close to Tristan, who's the CEO and founder and I wanted to invest.

Lenny (00:06:24):
Okay. So at this point you're a spec at NEA, you're trying to invest in dbt and okay, keep going.

Julia Schottenstein (00:06:29):
Yeah. So I was very, very excited. I thought if this worked, it could work in a really extraordinary way and I spent all my time trying to get Tristan to like me so that I could invest in the company. And then in 2020, I finally got the call that I was waiting for. Tristan said, "We're going to raise some money." He had a term sheet from a firm that he liked. It was a good venture fund, but he also liked me and he wanted to give me a shot and I was super excited to get that message because this is my chance. And unfortunately I ended up losing that deal to Sequoia. It's a formidable partner.

Lenny (00:07:04):
Reasonable loss.

Julia Schottenstein (00:07:05):
I was just so convicted that if was going to be a special company that I asked to even put my personal money in and I asked to put a very irresponsible, irrational amount, nearly like 20% of my liquid net worth into dbt because I was so convinced that this was special. And sometimes when deals don't work out as an investor, you can create this narrative in your head like, "Good, I dodged a bullet or better off without them or screw them." But for me that was quite the opposite with dbt. I really felt like dbt was this runaway train and it was special and I wanted to jump on board. So a few months later I ended up calling Tristan and asked him if I could be a part of the company that built the product that I thought was so special. So that was my unique path into product and to dbt.

Lenny (00:08:02):
So you invested in dbt and then an opportunity opened up where you ended up working there?

Julia Schottenstein (00:08:08):
No, I think if I was able to invest I wouldn't be here. So I got no, the board ended up vetoing my personal investment, but it's okay because I ended up dedicating all of my personal time to building the company.

Lenny (00:08:23):
Awesome. Okay. So something you touched on there that was really interesting of what you saw about dbt that was so interesting and I think this is maybe a broader question of just in your time investing and finding a company like dbt early, what have you learned about just picking well, finding companies early especially? What are signs in your experience of just that this is going to be something really interesting that you might want to join? And this is more for people listening that are thinking about joining a company early on. What do you think they should look for?

Julia Schottenstein (00:08:52):
So the way I would look at joining an early stage company would be the same way I would evaluate investing in one. So there are four things that I care about when I'm looking at really early stage companies and it's people, market, product and distribution. And I'll touch on each of those four to say a little bit more about what specifically I'm looking at. So people, this is really the CEO, the founder of the company put simply do you trust this person to lead. And for me, Tristan had this really rare ability to paint a very compelling future of the industry and how dbt was going to be a part of making that vision a reality. But he also was really, really detailed in the day-to-day work of the analytics engineering work. And it was that range in scale that made me feel like this is a founder that's very rare and compelling.

(00:09:42):
The next is markets. We touched on it a little bit, but what I'm looking for in markets it's like is it growing? Is there space for new entrant to make its mark? And when it came to dbt, it was an explosive time in cloud data warehouses and it was that chaos that was really the opportunity for dbt because they created some orderliness and structure to the way that people worked with their data in the cloud data warehouse. So that was very compelling. The next is product. Everyone who's listening hopefully either is interested in products or has a product background. So I won't say too much there, but can you talk to users or potential customers, are they building something that's really special, unique? Can you hear that, spark that enthusiasm and figure out if this is going to be special.

(00:10:31):
And then the last, I think this is more important arguably than if they have a good product but is distribution, do they have an advantage on how are they going to get to market because that's really, really hard? And think about how they think about their competitive advantage on either the ecosystem or distribution and how they're going to ultimately sell the product. You're not going to get a 10 out of 10 on all four dimensions. So when you're joining a company, you also have the benefit of dedicating your time. So try to think if they're weaker on one dimension, what is it that you bring to the table or what are you special at that could potentially de-risk the success of the company

Lenny (00:11:11):
In terms of spark with a product. Right now on product market fit, now how do you know if you have product market fit? And a lot of it often comes down to there's a emotional reaction from someone you're talking to about the product you're building. There's like, "Holy shit, I want this now." Is there anything even more specific you've seen of just what is a sign that this, there's a spark that people are just really enthused? You talked about people made dbt part of their identity. Is there anything else there?

Julia Schottenstein (00:11:36):
Yeah. It's can they not stop talking about it and that's the chatter about a product, they want to share it with their teammates or to other people at different companies. That just top of mind love and wanting to share what they've found with others is really a great sign that you're onto something. And then that spark will help do a lot of the work on how do you get to market because your evangelists are really your users of people that love what you're building.

Lenny (00:12:06):
What about in terms of the distribution bucket? What are some examples of just really important, I don't know, unique or effective distribution strategies or I don't know, unfair advantages you've seen maybe with dbt, maybe other companies? What are some examples of that?

Julia Schottenstein (00:12:20):
So dbt had an ecosystem advantage and they were open source and this helped really dramatically for lots of people to have low barrier friction to just try it out and spread organically. They first got started with very horizontal. People could just get started without ever even talking to sales and think that was a competitive advantage. But not all companies need to be product led. Some companies are enterprise top-down sales. So in those situations think about does the team really know how to land a complex enterprise sale? Do they have a background in that particular space? Do they have a network of connections? Can be different depending on what the company is selling, but you either want to see a company that's really strong at enterprise or really strong at the bottoms up.

Lenny (00:13:11):
Okay, cool. So I want to shift a bit to talking about an area that you have a lot of experience in which a lot of people are also really interested in right now, which is M&A. I've invested in a lot of companies and maybe, I don't know, once a month I'm getting an email from a startup I've been investor in. There's just like, we're looking at maybe selling the company, things aren't working out the way we were hoping. And you've been on I think maybe all sides of the table of M&A transactions, including I think you led the acquisition of a company... I was an investor in the dbt acquired that I think is public company called Transform. So my question is just for founders who are currently thinking about M&A meaning acquisition essentially. What's your best advice for them for how to be most successful in M&A outcome for themselves?

Julia Schottenstein (00:13:57):
When it comes to acquisitions, the time to start thinking about an M&A strategy is hopefully when you don't need one. And the best strategy that I could give a founder is to have a really strong offense in building their company. And when founders start their businesses, they don't usually set out to start a company to sell it to another business. They start it to be an enduring independent standalone company. And if you have that path, then you'll have the upper hand in absolutely every single M&A conversation because you have a viable alternative, which is do nothing, stay the course, you don't have to sell. But of course that's not the case for most companies. Most companies don't have a viable path to being an independent company forever. So they have to think about M&A. So M&A is always about creating plan Bs.

(00:14:49):
And the way I would think about it is for any one company, there's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic. And the strategy that I would do and how do you get noticed is I would figure out the area that you bring a competitive advantage and I would inflict pain on that potential buyer. Make it impossible for them to not notice you because that's when they're going to have their ears perk up and say, "Well, what's going on with this company?" We just bought this company Transform. They are playing a really good playbook here.

(00:15:25):
And the really important piece here is you want to do that in a way that's still friendly and open. I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely will shut down a conversation or they won't talk to an incumbent or a potential future buyer because they take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs and you don't want to shut that door down prematurely because you don't know if you can really go the distance and be an independent company. So you want to have optionality.

Lenny (00:15:54):
I love this term with pain on your potential acquirers. What are some examples of that? Who's done that well or what's an example of that interaction?

Julia Schottenstein (00:16:03):
Yeah. I mean I can share the transform stories of a company we just acquired, we announced it in February. So dbt Labs, we build transformations, that's our main product. And we were venturing into a new product area that we call the semantic layer. And to describe what that is quickly, it's allowing companies to define their business metrics and so that whenever anyone queries it, we always serve back consistent data on those business metrics and transform. They were a pure play company only in this metrics layer, semantic layer. And they had a really strong product.

(00:16:41):
They had figured out some of the technical challenges and they had solved it early on. They had the benefit of having worked at Airbnb, which and Airbnb in the data world is famous for having a really successful semantic layer metrics layer called Minerva. And what we had at dbt Labs is really good distribution and ecosystem, but we were a little behind in bringing a product to market and we felt that pressure from Transform because they were doing such a great job at being vocal and loud about how their semantic layer solves these really hard technical problems.

(00:17:20):
But they didn't have any distribution. So that was really tough for them and they were putting pressure, but they were still positioning their company as a partner to us because they wanted our community to be excited about what they were building and hopefully lure them over to use their product. So because they had positioned themselves as a friendly partner when really we were trying to compete for this similar use case, when it came time to do an acquisition, we were really excited because we knew their product was good and they had already done a lot of the work to make integrating with dbt possible and that helps us post acquisition do the integration much more easily.

Lenny (00:18:01):
How do you just think about either as a startup or even an incumbent about how to think about competition, how much emphasis, how much energy to put into thinking what competitors are doing and just how that informs your strategy?

Julia Schottenstein (00:18:15):
So we recently codified our philosophy when it comes to competition. And I'll give Nick Handel the founder of Transform who led this exercise at dbt Labs. But we really have three pillars when it comes to competition. So the first is hold true to our vision. We're really excited about the path and the journey that we're going on at dbt Labs and we don't want the distraction. So occasionally you'll have competitors maybe throw shade or throw stones, but most of that is just noise. If you have a lot of conviction that you're going in the right journey, you want to just keep your eyes straight ahead and run your best race and not be too distracted by what maybe some critics are saying.

(00:19:00):
The second philosophy we have is really a grow the pie philosophy. So we want to work with our partners in our ecosystem to make the opportunity set even larger and we see that today. We mostly serve reporting and BI use cases, we're seeing lots of companies start to operationalize their data. Now with this big wave of ML, clean Transform data assets are being used to train machine learning models so that the pie continues to grow. Let's focus on that as our target and work with people to make the opportunity set really attractive and not try to slice it up too thinly.

(00:19:37):
And then the last one is we want to lean into our strengths. So we have an ambition to be a platform company and we know what we're good at, but we also want to leave space for our ecosystem to offer solutions to our users that help them out. And we really want to foster an ecosystem where we can partner with lots of companies in the modern data stack. And generally speaking, when it comes to competition, we take a really long-term view and there are a few areas that we do want to hold our ground and that's in our transformation standard as well as our semantic standard because we believe those two are better served together for the user's sake. But for everything else, we really feel like we can work with our ecosystem and accomplish what we want to accomplish and also help them accomplish their goals too.

Lenny (00:20:27):
This might be a good time to just chat about dbt and the success the company has had. So many startups have tried to become a standard default layer of what's now called the modern data stack. And I don't know any startup doesn't use dbt or planning to use dbt. It's just a incredibly rare success story somewhere to snowflake where it's just like it's the default for building large data startups and most startups these days work with a lot of data. So my question is just like what do you think dbt did most right to win in this and continue to win?

Julia Schottenstein (00:21:01):
So I think dbt did a lot of things right, but I'll point out too that really stick out to me. And the first is just power and simplicity and the second is a commitment to being open. And I'll touch on what I mean by those two things. So when dbt was first getting started, you would hear a lot from companies, I don't understand, what's so special about dbt? We have a SQL templating tool at our company, we built one in-house. Like this is really straightforward and simple and it's true like dbt is really simple, but that is the power of it.

(00:21:37):
So our founders, Tristan, Drew and Connor, they had a belief that the people who do data analysis work, that really work closely with their business stakeholders should also be the ones to contribute to creating clean data assets in production because that data prep work is a necessary prerequisite for any analysis that you do. So dbt was really this belief that if you know SQL, we want to invite you to do these workflows that were traditionally held by data engineers but you had to earn that. So dbt has this nice framework where it's harder to mess up, keeps data quality really high, but it is pretty simple to get started and learn and learn. And that was really the unlock in the industry. We were definitely solving a pain point at the right time.

(00:22:26):
And then the second thing is this commitment to being open. So dbt is open source and that's the main guts of dbt where you write your business logic and it helps in a number of ways. Specifically it helps with flywheel, keep the flywheel running and also with network effects. And I'll explain what that looks like. So dbt is really easy to get started with at your company with reduced friction. We're building a product that people, so they talk about it, they want to share it both at their organization and with other companies. Other companies get started with dbt again with reduced friction.

(00:23:05):
We now get to see this really diverse set of use cases for dbt across company sizes, across industries and it allows us to build a truly horizontal company. As our company grows, we get to invest back into our community and our product and the flywheel begins to spin faster. And then meanwhile we have a really large user base. So we have 20,000 companies using dbt every single week and that attracts partners to want to build for dbt and so they share best practices, build workflows, and now if you're a company and you've standardized on dbt, you've really unlocked an integrated modern data ecosystem that wasn't available for you before. So that has a flywheel and also benefits everyone that decides to be on the standard. So it's those two really important trends that made dbt so powerful today.

Lenny (00:24:02):
So what I'm hearing there is essentially the product was right for what people needed to solve. There's also a product led component, open source, free self-serve piece that people adopted, used and started working and then scaled and started paying for it. And then there's an alignment of the vision of where this was going and how it fit with how people wanted this to work for them. Is there anything else? Because a lot of startups do that and that all sounds really smart and good, but a lot of startups try to do those things and no one cares. Maybe their product isn't necessarily what people are looking for, maybe they don't get the right distribution. I don't know. Is there anything else that you think they did really well that helped them kickstart this to even be a thing? Is it timing that was really great? Is it specific influencers early on?

Julia Schottenstein (00:24:48):
Yeah. I think timing was really important with the success of dbt. That they were there when the cloud data warehouses were really exploding and growing in an enormous way. And dbt Labs started as Fishtown Analytics, a consulting firm. So they worked really, really closely and hands-on with all of their consulting partners to get the pain point and really solve firsthand challenges that they saw. I think that combination of being at the right place at the right time and also getting to work really closely with people's day-to-day problems created a really special experience.

Lenny (00:25:29):
I didn't know that. That's a really important element of the story is basically they were focused... How long did they do that Fishtown Analytics consultancy?

Julia Schottenstein (00:25:38):
Board consulting part of the business was almost two years.

Lenny (00:25:42):
Okay. So they basically spent two years solving this problem basically manually for people, and that's such a great way to understand real pain and figure out how to solve it.

Julia Schottenstein (00:25:53):
Totally.

Lenny (00:25:54):
Awesome. Okay, so that's a really interesting insight. Just spend a few years. It sounds like it was almost manually helping people transform their data using whatever tools already existed.

Julia Schottenstein (00:26:05):
Yeah. Well, they were building dbt and using dbt to help them do their jobs better and supporting their clients. And whenever they encountered paper cuts or friction or the workflow was taking longer than they expected, they would build that into dbt. And that really matured the experience of the product because the people who were building it, the founders were also day-to-day working with these customers or clients that had pain points.

Lenny (00:26:36):
That reminds me of a story you told me about how you made your eng team do some manual work of an algorithm involved in transformation. Can you share that?

Julia Schottenstein (00:26:47):
Okay. So I'm going to preface this story by sharing that I'm a huge math nerd and one of my favorite books on logic is called Girdle Escher Bach. And in this book there's a fun scene where there's an ant farm that bands together to do the work of a computer flipping bits from zero to one to solve logic gates. So this chapter of that book was really the inspiration for an exercise that I ran my team through. So about a year ago we were doing a big zero to one new project at dbt Labs and we were going to change the algorithm for how we built customers data transformation graphs. And I needed a way for the team to really internalize all of the changes that we were going to be making and I needed them to own it because otherwise they wouldn't be able to anticipate all of the edge cases and it wouldn't be quite as durable. You couldn't copy paste the algorithm.

(00:27:41):
So I showed up to a team offsite with a spool of rope and sticky notes and I think my team looked at me crazy, went with two heads when I started to tie people up to create a graph. So each note of the graph was an engineer and the rope was the edges of the graph to connect them. And then we worked through the new algorithm extremely slowly, step by step. And it was a way that you couldn't leave that exercise without knowing exactly what was going on because everyone had a role to play.

(00:28:16):
So I think a lot of times when you're starting something new, you get into a situation where a few people really understand it and they're running way ahead of the rest of the pack. But I needed a way for the whole team to go along for the journey. So I'm constantly trying to create these important moments or memorable moments for the team so that it's centered around our mission and they can have the ownership of taking the project and making it successful. So it was perhaps a overly creative or kooky way to spend the day, but it was really successful.

Lenny (00:28:49):
What was the actual algorithm you were trying to implement?

Julia Schottenstein (00:28:53):
We were trying to figure out how to make flipping the way that we run people's dags from an imperative way to a declarative way. So instead of running things left to when data arrived in your warehouse. You think about it as reverse, like what would need to happen to make your data SLAs be materialized in time.

Lenny (00:29:16):
Awesome. And sounds like the team found that valuable.

Julia Schottenstein (00:29:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:20):
Okay. Reminds me of a clip from this last season of Ted Lasso where they have used red strings and I won't get into it, but if you've seen it you will know what I'm talking about. I want to come back to your chatting about open source versus not open source. So some part of dbt was is open source and some isn't. I'm curious how the team decides what is open source and what should be open source, what isn't open source and what to charge for?

Julia Schottenstein (00:29:50):
We think about dbt open source. It's really the guts of the data transformation. It's where you describe your business logic. And then on the cloud side we build proprietary software that supercharges the development life cycle and the productionization of dbt at scale. So what we think about as leaving for our cloud offering is we deal with state, so stateful interactions and also any cross team or structural collaboration. We want to reserve that for our proprietary offering. And I think it's really important to have that distinction of what do you believe should be open source or what is the open standard that really matters? And ecosystem to us is really important. So it's important that that remains open source, but then we want to supercharge that experience with an open core model and build proprietary software that makes people much more successful at using dbt.

Lenny (00:30:48):
Today's episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products, then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about AssemblyAI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs. Product team that startups and enterprises are using AssemblyAI to automatically transcribe and summarize phone calls and virtual meetings, detect topics in podcasts, pinpoint when sensitive content spoken and lots more. All of AssemblyAI's models which are accessed through their API are production ready.

(00:31:26):
So many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI and AssemblyAI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases. Now's the time to check out AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to bring the highest accuracy transcription plus valuable insights to your customers. Just like Spotify, CallRail and writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground. That's assemblyai.com/lenny. I know you also spent a lot of time thinking about pricing and willingness to pay and things along those lines.

(00:32:03):
Is there anything you could share about which is what you've learned about how to think about pricing for a tool like this or even in general?

Julia Schottenstein (00:32:09):
Pricing and willingness to pay is such a hard conversation and lots of startups don't do this early enough in their company journey. Likely a side effect of zero interest rates where investors were happy funding GitHub stars and usage and companies never thought about how am I going to make revenue or make money, which is it's important. So for us at dbt Labs, I don't claim to be perfect at it, but we're trying to get a better muscle around it. And I always think about Madhavan who wrote this book Pricing Innovation. I know you've had him on the show before, but he shares that you don't get to decide if you're going to have a pricing or willingness to pay a conversation. You only get to decide what. So it's much better to have that conversation before you build the product than have it when your sales team's trying to sell something and people aren't excited about what you've built, aren't willing to pay for it.

(00:33:04):
And at dbt Labs we have this value, it's one of our core values that says we are more concerned with value creation than value capture. And we really mean this. When we talk about what is the value of dbt Labs to our customers, they often talk about how it's either 20 to 35% as valuable as what they spend on their cloud data warehouse. But what we charge our customers is a very small fraction of that 20 to 35% and that's by design. And last year we did our first ever pricing change in the company history and you learn a tremendous amount when you have that event because you get to test the price elasticity by of your customers.

(00:33:49):
And it's so important to learn that lesson while the company is still smaller or the stakes are lower because pricing just is always evolving. It's not a fixed thing, it gets more complex over time. So we have to think about it quite a bit because my team builds proprietary software for dbt cloud and when we lose a deal we most often lose it to dbt open source and we like it that way. We're happy to lose to ourselves, but we have to really think very deeply about what are people willing to pay for and what moves the needle for them and focus on that.

Lenny (00:34:26):
I'm so curious what that pricing process was like to figure out what to change. Is there anything you could share about just what that was for you or what are some just surprises that came out of that process or just like, "Wow, we didn't expect that in these conversations?"

Julia Schottenstein (00:34:42):
It's really like an all hands on deck conversation. Pricing is so cross-cutting because it's a finance discussion as well. You're modeling out things in spreadsheets and figuring out how that might impact the business. But you can't just solve these problems in spreadsheets. You have to go talk to customers, test the waters, understand where people's appetites are and sussing that out is really hard. And then of course there's a product piece to it too where you have to affect it and communicate it as well. So it was very cross-cutting. We learned a lot. We track our conversion rates really carefully. We track our turn rates very carefully and I think largely we were happy with the change that we made and we felt like one of the big things that we were trying to solve for was have our pricing catch up to how people valued the tool.

Lenny (00:35:40):
How many people did you end up talking to, who was doing these conversations and is there anything really important you learned about how to ask these questions and these sorts of leanness to pay conversations?

Julia Schottenstein (00:35:50):
So we talked to dozens. It was combination of product and product marketing, having the conversations and people aren't very willing to share explicitly what they will pay. But there's some tools that we use on relative value. People most think about what is the relative value of dbt in their cloud warehouse. And we also tried to employ some of the tactics that we tried to suss out what do people view as very inexpensive? What's a price point that's very cheap or a no-brainer? What price point is maybe fair or comfortable for them and what would be too expensive? And then we had all the data back to figure out where we landed.

Lenny (00:36:34):
I want to come back to M&A for a bit. I had a few more questions there and I moved on from that. So again, you've done a lot of work within the M&A realm. Something that I saw recently, and this connects to the fact that a lot of startups now are looking to get sold. This VC hunter walk, he's a founder of Home Brew Ventures, had this interesting blog post where he basically suggested you should actually think about being public about the fact that you're selling your company. Which is crazy because in the past you never want to come across as too selly. I don't want people to think I'm desperate. And his point is many startups are desperate right now and it's okay to be public about that. And then in theory creates more of a bidding situation where many people know versus keeping it secret and in closed rooms. So my question is just what do you think of that? Do you think that's effective strategy? Is it not?

Julia Schottenstein (00:37:28):
I think it's good advice. If you're in a Hail Mary situation where you're looking for a home or you need an exit for your business, it's better to be transparent and cast a wider net. And you're right, in previous times founders tried to be a little bit cute or obfuscate that they were evasive the situation that they were in because they wanted to drum up some competitive interest when there really wasn't any. But unfortunately in today's climate, too many companies are in that spot so it's impossible to hide it. So the better approach is just to be transparent and I see it pretty regularly and there's absolutely no shame in sending a note that says something like, "Hey, we're looking for an exit for our company X, Y, and Z didn't pan out as we expected. We built a really interesting product and we want to keep the team together. We're running a process. Are you interested?" Really just as simple as that.

Lenny (00:38:24):
I've seen a lot of companies put together these really detailed decks or even websites of just like, here's the team, here's what we built to be very promotional about it. Is that something you've seen? Is that something you'd recommend?

Julia Schottenstein (00:38:35):
Yeah. Usually in these situations people are acquiring the teams and so having your data room together, really the most important thing is these are the team members that are going to come along with the acquisition is the biggest motivator for why a buyer would get excited.

Lenny (00:38:52):
You made this point earlier that a lot of the seeds need to be planted early for you to have the best outcome. And this reminded me... So I had a startup local mine that we sold to Airbnb and I met Airbnb initially at a year before we actually started exploring the process at a random party at South by Southwest where I was, I actually have no memory of this party, but the head of product at Airbnb, Joe bought, remembered it and came back to us a year later and just like, "Hey, what are you guys up to? Maybe we could collaborate on some stuff," and that led to an acquisition. So I think that's just wanted to touch a ban on that point of just the power of, the way I thought about it is let a thousand flowers bloom, just like meet everyone. Get the word out that you're around and what you're doing so that in the future when someone has that problem they're like, "That company, maybe we should talk to them."

Julia Schottenstein (00:39:37):
Yeah, you want to make sure that the buyer knows who you are before the acquisition moment and hopefully that's because you've made an impact and they like what you're building. Maybe you've inflicted some pain on them. But yeah, certainly creating those connections well ahead of an exit event is important.

Lenny (00:39:58):
And specifically there it's meet people at your competitors potentially. For us, Airbnb was never even a potential company we would sell to because it had nothing to do with it but ended up making sense down the road. What's like the realm of the companies and people that you think people should think about meeting?

Julia Schottenstein (00:40:12):
If the company is buying a lot or they're active, they often have corp dev teams and so use that corp dev team to your advantage. It's their job to meet absolutely every company that could be potentially interested. So take that meeting, say you're not interested in an acquisition just yet, but push them to make an introduction to someone that could sponsor the deal. So usually that's someone in product or maybe a GM and use that as a starting point for maybe just a conversation, maybe something more like a partnership but get the corp dev team to work for you.

Lenny (00:40:50):
What if you're at the other end of the spectrum and you're in dire straits right now and you're just like, "Man, what do we do to potentially sell this company?" I know odds are not going to be great, but just what do you suggest folks do in terms of I guess finding connections to potential companies that might be acquirers?

Julia Schottenstein (00:41:07):
Yeah. I mean use your network. Usually your venture capitalist has a really big network and one of the things that I hear founders feeling the most nervous about is a duty to return the money to the investors. And maybe this is a unpopular thing to say on a podcast, but your investors understand that they're not making their money back. And what they want to do instead is have you end up at a really great company like an Airbnb because that will help them down the road. So it's all about the long game, but use your investors to help you find connections at different companies that could be buying and don't worry so much about disappointing them or being really realistic about where you are in your company journey.

Lenny (00:41:55):
To build on that, I'm just an angel investor, I'm not like the lead fund and they feel differently I imagine. But the last thing I want for a founders to get stuck at a company they hate and just so that they could return some money or have some outcome rather they just give up, move on. Life is short.

Julia Schottenstein (00:42:11):
Yeah. I think founders forget that it is so risky investing in early stage companies that 50% of portfolios investments don't return anything. And that's just part of the game and it's a very acceptable path where hey, we gave it our best shot. It didn't work out and moving on.

Lenny (00:42:36):
Which is tough a lot of times for founders that are told like it's all about grit and not giving up and don't quit. Sometimes you should quit.

Julia Schottenstein (00:42:43):
Gosh, yeah. I don't want to say that. I think being founders, it's an extremely lonely role sometimes and it is very hard to know what your next chapter will look like or what the journey will look like and sometimes you really are out of cash and you do have to find a home. But I hope that you can continue to fight and find a way forward.

Lenny (00:43:08):
Agreed. Specifically for people thinking about selling their company, are there any companies you think are good companies for people to look at right now that are actively acquiring or open to M&A?

Julia Schottenstein (00:43:19):
This is a tough one. I think a lot of companies are on the sidelines for a number of reasons. And they could be on the sidelines because they just did an acquisition and they're trying to digest or integrate that company. They could be on the sidelines because they're not growing headcount as much and M&A is often org chart gymnastics of folding the target companies headcount into your budget and plan and maybe just don't have a lot of space. Or probably more common right now is there's just a general uncertainty about the future. And in highly volatile markets people want to take care of their own and even the best M&A deals at a level of complexity that a lot of buyers are just not looking to take on right now.

(00:44:07):
So there are a number of reasons why people might sit out, but what I would do if I were in a position of wanting to sell my company is I would come up with a buyer set of maybe a dozen and really there aren't more than a dozen companies that will find what you're doing to be a very good fit. Start with your buyer set and then start calling the list by looking at some of the criteria that might count people out. And then go have those conversations. And if you're in a Hail Mary situation, be very transparent about it. Maybe open up the buyer list. But if you still have some room, I would maybe focus on two to three partner or buyers and really play a different playbook, which is inflict pain. Make it really hard for them to not notice you but do it with a smile and be friendly at while you do that.

Lenny (00:44:57):
Sometimes with M&A discussions, there's a lot of subtlety to the way you communicate where you don't come out and be like, please we'd love to sell our company to you. Any advice on just the phrasing and how to approach it or do you think it's just, it's fine, just tell us we're looking to sell our company. Are you interested in being buyer?

Julia Schottenstein (00:45:15):
Yeah. I just wouldn't be too clever here. Everyone understands like I'm evaluating strategic alternatives. It means you're looking to sell your company and it depends. Do you have time? If you have time, yeah. Don't come out and say, "Hey, I'm for sale." That's not going to end up in a good outcome. But depends where you are in your company journey. If you have time, then don't talk about M&A at all. That's the last thing that you want to speak about. Instead, you're talking about maybe collaborating or partnerships. How do we work together? Knowledge sharing and M&A is a dirty word if you have a lot of runway and you're going to try to continue to pursue an independent path, but if you're out of time, you're out of time.

Lenny (00:46:08):
That's such good advice. I remember the term we used was we want to explore a strategic partnership and everyone's just like, I knows what you mean by that, but you just don't want to say it.

Julia Schottenstein (00:46:19):
Yeah. It's like everyone in the room's looking like yeah. Okay. Strategic partnership or a strategic alternative, it's like we all know these code words and we understand the situation you're in.

Lenny (00:46:31):
Yeah. When do you think M&A market might pick up again? I know it's impossible to predict. Do you have any sense?

Julia Schottenstein (00:46:37):
Yeah. I wish I had a magic ball. That'd be pretty sweet. I think what is happening though is we're far enough out from the peak of the markets. So the peak was really November of 2021. And why does that matter? Two things. One, founders are coming to terms with valuations that they maybe received at the highest of the market, are no longer going to hold in this market and companies are out of cash or maybe out of options. We'll be better assets entering the market soon. And at a certain point the opportunities will just be too great. That will incentivize a lot of the buyers that have been on the bench to start participating again in the M&A market. And I don't know exactly when that will be, but I think we're pretty close. I think we're pretty close.

Lenny (00:47:28):
And you mentioned a value that you have at dbt. I forget exactly what it was, but I'm curious what are the other values that you have at dbt, whatever you can share. Always curious what principles and values companies come down to help drive the way they think.

Julia Schottenstein (00:47:42):
The value that I shared is we are more concerned with value creation than value capture and that really drives everything that we do. We try to put a lot of good out into the world and it pays back slowly. The whole mission of dbt Labs is to help analytics engineers disseminate organizational knowledge through data. So we really believe also being participants of sharing that information and getting more people knowledgeable about all sorts of things.

(00:48:13):
Transparency wins. We're a really transparent company. We share our board decks. We have lots of communication and participation in all of our Slacks. We're writing culture. We have hard conversations in the open. So that's another a big one. Transparency always wins. We are humble. We don't ever feel like we are successful. We come at this from a very humble space where we feel like we have to serve our community and our users and that really motivates us. And then another one is just work done well as its own end and it's really focusing on the journey and not the end destination.

Lenny (00:48:56):
Awesome. I want to do a post someday of just like, here's the values all these different successful companies have come to and see if there's any patterns. I'm actually doing a post right now on Snowflake and on Figma and what you touched on. There's such a connection and a thread of obsessing with your users and making sure they're happy at Figma. I forget exactly what it is, but it's just like in this article, it's going to come out tomorrow actually. So people get a sense of when we recorded this where they think of their company as software as a service where service is their number one goal. They actually provide service and software is just a way to do that. And then it's Snowflake. Their number one core value is put customers first and they talk a lot about how they just actually informs their prioritization all I think, and all their thinking. So it's interesting. That also comes up a lot in what you're talking about, which I think it's easy to say, but I think what actually separates companies that succeed is they actually put this into practice.

Julia Schottenstein (00:49:51):
It's really interesting too because a lot of the people who work at dbt Labs came from the community, so they feel this real ownership in making the experience an excellent one because they were so compelled to come join dbt Labs because the product changed the way that they work or changed their lives. So that commitment to the community and product experience is really, really strong.

Lenny (00:50:14):
This isn't another thread. Maybe we'll go down real quick. I'm working on a different post around Reddit and how to work with really opinionated users that strong opinions about changes to the product and the way they described it, these guys were there for five years working with the community on the product. Is that to your users, the product is their baby, basically. It's like they think it's theirs versus the companies. And I'm curious, having a really strong opinionated community, what it sounds like you also have, what have you learned about just working with them to build product that makes them happy and avoid revolts and really upsetness?

Julia Schottenstein (00:50:51):
It's hard as you grow. I think it's just a challenge cause our community gets bigger. You can't service everybody's needs. But I think what we've done is everyone is very deep in our own product. I think one of the cool stats is at dbt Labs we have over 30% of our employee headcount has contributed to our data transformation workflow. So that's across every discipline. It's in obviously product, obviously in our data team. Our marketing team also contributes to data transformation. And our engineering team will also contribute to our internal dbt analytics project and that sense of really understanding what the experience is like and then soliciting as much feedback as we possibly can. We have a dbt Slack community of 50,000 and all of our employees are in that Slack channel regularly and can feel when we mess up or we don't quite deliver an experience that we're proud of, you will just see dozens of people trying to jump on board and try to make it better.

Lenny (00:52:02):
Is there any other frameworks or just general processes that you found to be release useful in building awesome product running teams?

Julia Schottenstein (00:52:10):
I'm not a big framework person, but there's two sayings that I find myself repeating or I either to myself or to others. And it's worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem. And what do I mean by that? It's really to help me combat this perfectionism because perfect doesn't exist and you should instead go with good enough because when you ship, that's the moment when you get to learn a lot from your users and you just can't anticipate it. You try very hard to understand exactly how people will use the product and get all the edges ironed out. But you can't until you ship. And I'll share an example. So my team helps support the dbt cloud scheduler and the initial version of the dbt cloud scheduler was pretty naive. We were a little embarrassed by it.

(00:53:02):
It was a big old for loop over a big old jobs table. So we would look like is it time for this job to run? Okay. Yes, run this job. Okay. It's not time for this job to run next, continue on. Is it time? Yes, run this job. And it would just loop over and it's extremely naive and very simple, but it got the job done. And I try to remind the engineers, we would be so lucky to have tech debt because that means people are using the product. And now we've had to rebuild our scheduler several times over because we do have meaningful scale. We have 8,000 companies using our scheduler. We have to manage 10 million runs per month. But what we didn't need at launch was a distributed scheduler with coworkers and RabbitMQ. We just didn't need it because we had no users. So these two sayings that worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem, just really reminds people like, let's ship, let's get it out into the user's hands and then we'll learn and iterate and it'll be a better experience for them.

Lenny (00:54:08):
That's a good segue to my last question. So weren't a PM before this role. You have strong experience in investing, investment banking business in general. I'm curious what you think product managers should maybe focus on more or learn more or lean into to become stronger product leaders based on the experience you've had moving into product.

Julia Schottenstein (00:54:30):
So I pull a lot on my experience or some of the things that I did was as an investor in my current role in product. And maybe I'll touch on what is the scale of a venture capitalist might be a little bit foreign for people, but venture capitalists, they spend all their day meeting lots of different companies, context switching. They have to know a little bit about quite a lot of different things. And they do this to refine their investment tastes or find their investor judgment. And they're also investing a lot in their network and connecting people, supporting people, and mining people for ideas that are way smarter than they are. So you do that all the time in Venture and I've brought a lot of those skills with me into product and it translates really well.

(00:55:17):
The first is I still spend a lot of time investing in my network and I think it's an underrated way for a PM to spend their time. And I try to build a network of operators at other companies that are like dbt Labs that are growing nicely, maybe a little bit ahead of where we are. And I ask them questions, how did you navigate open source? How did you navigate pricing? How did you navigate acquisitions? And then I take the best ideas, figure out which ones I can apply and bring it back to dbt Labs. The second thing is I really think my special T or my superpower is that I'm a T-shaped generalist. So I know a little about a lot of things from finance to business to product. I have to go a lot deeper in product in the areas that I specialize in. That's where the tail of the tea comes in. But it's precisely because I've had a diverse background that makes me more effective when I'm trying to get things done within the organization. Because I have just more credible experiences that I can pull from.

(00:56:18):
And then the last thing that I think maybe doesn't show up day to day in my product work, but in investing, you're constantly thinking about risk and the power laws, and we touched on this before, but most investments don't work out. You lose the dollars that you put in, but all the returns come from these rare events that make up for all the losses. You have to think about what are the uncapped upside opportunities in investing. And I think in product, you still have to do the same thing. If 50% of the things I worked on went to zero, we'd have a problem. But it encourages me to continue to make bets for the company that has the chance of bending the trajectory of our business.

Lenny (00:57:03):
We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:07):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (00:57:08):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:12):
Okay. So two books that helped me learn a lot about myself. Range, it's a book about generalist and also Quiet, it's a book about introverts. And then I like a lot of biographies. So a few of my favorites are Snowball about Warren Buffet, Made in America, about Sam Walton and Leonardo da Vinci.

Lenny (00:57:31):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:34):
So I almost watched a movie in preparation for this podcast, but I really don't watch things except in the holiday. During the holidays, I like Succession, but I have not seen the latest season.

Lenny (00:57:46):
Wow. You're in store for a treat. Favorite interview question you like to ask?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:53):
When's the last time you had to teach yourself something new and how'd you do it? So I like to test for growth mindset and a thirst for learning. And then also why dbt Labs. I think a lot of people who come to dbt Labs have very authentic reasons why they're drawn to the company. And in moments where in things are tough, it's the answer to that question of why are you here, it's going to make all the difference.

Lenny (00:58:17):
And sounds like what you look for is just like an genuine enthusiasm.

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:21):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:22):
Awesome. What are some favorite products you recently discovered that you really like?

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:27):
I like Belly. It's a consumer social app that lets you find and discover restaurants and rate them with your friends. It's been a lot of fun looking at the New York City restaurant scene.

Lenny (00:58:37):
I've never heard of that. Awesome. What is something relatively minor you've changed in the way you all do? Product that has had a lot of impact?

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:42):
Do fewer things and try to single thread the team as much as possible.

Lenny (00:58:50):
And single thread meaning like one main priority, one goal?

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:53):
One mission. Yeah. We're all working rowing in the same direction.

Lenny (00:58:57):
Final question. You have a podcast, first of all, tell us what it's called, but second of all, what's a favorite podcast of yours other than this podcast and your podcast?

Julia Schottenstein (00:59:05):
Yeah. It's called the Analytics Engineering Podcast, so if you want to learn more about the data industry, I host it every other week with our CEO Tristan Handy. It's a lot of fun. Check it out. Other podcasts that I really like are In Depth, it's First Rounds podcast by Bretton. He interviews a lot of operators about how they do their very best work. And another podcast that I really like is the Logan Bartlett Show, which touches on timely trends in tech.

Lenny (00:59:34):
And In Depth I think Todd Jackson actually hosts a lot of the episodes too. Also, a huge fan of the podcast. Definitely check it out. And then say your podcast again and how can folks find it?

Julia Schottenstein (00:59:43):
It's called the Analytics Engineering Podcast.

Lenny (00:59:47):
And it's just in podcasting apps?

Julia Schottenstein (00:59:48):
Yes.

Lenny (00:59:49):
Amazing. Check it out. Julia, we've talked about inflicting pain and strategic partnerships and why worse is better. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

# From managing people to managing AI: The leadership skills everyone needs now | Julie Zhuo

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions. There's something in this episode for everyone. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):
Bye.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions. There's something in this episode for everyone. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):
Bye.

# OpenAI researcher on why soft skills are the future of work | Karina Nguyen

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Not only are you working at the cutting edge of AI and LLMs, you're actually building the cutting edge.

Karina Nguyen (00:00:06):
When I first came to Anthropic and I was like, "Oh my God, I really love front-end engineering." And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized, "Oh my God, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
What skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams, in particular?

Karina Nguyen (00:00:26):
Creative thinking and you kind of want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. I think it's actually really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
What do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?

Karina Nguyen (00:00:46):
When you taught the model, some of the self-knowledge of you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world, the model would get extremely confused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
Today my guest is Karina Nguyen. Karina is an AI researcher at OpenAI where she helped build Canvas, tasks, the o1 chain-of-thought model and more. Prior to OpenAI, she was at Anthropic where she led work on post-training and evaluation for the Claude 3 models, built a document upload feature with 100K context windows and so much more. She was also an engineer at New York Times, was a designer at Dropbox and at Square. It's very rare to get a glimpse into how someone working on the bleeding edge of AI and LLMs operates and how they think about where things are heading. Canvas

(00:01:31):
In our conversation, we talk about how teams that OpenAI operate and build products, what skills she thinks you should be building as AI gets smarter, how models are created, why synthetic data will allow models to keep getting smarter and why she moved from engineering to research after realizing how good LLMs are going to be at coding. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Karina Nguyen.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta. And I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:22):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:25):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:32):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018. Focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001 today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:04):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:10):
That is very much our experience, but before the company and to some extent during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:26):
We appreciate you for doing that. And you have a special discount for listeners, they can get $1,000 off Vanta at Vanta.com/Lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/Lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:41):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:45):
Karina, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Karina Nguyen (00:04:48):
Thank you so much, Lenny, for inviting me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):
I'm very excited to have you here because not only are you working at the cutting edge of AI and LLMs, you're actually building the cutting edge of AI and LLMs. You recently launched this feature, which basically... the first agent feature of OpenAI. I also just did this survey, I don't know if you know about this. I did a survey of my readers and asked them what tools do you use every day in your work and most use? And ChatGPT was number one, above Gmail, above Slack, above anything else. 90% of people said they use ChatGPT regularly. 

Karina Nguyen (00:05:23):
That's quite good. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:23):
It's absurd. It wasn't around two years ago.

Karina Nguyen (00:05:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):
Also, we're recording this the week that OpenAI announced Stargate, which is this half trillion dollar investment in AI infrastructure. So there's just a lot happening constantly in AI and you have a really unique glimpse into how things are working, where things are going, how work gets done. So I have a lot of questions for you. I want to talk about how you operate and how you work at OpenAI, where you think things are going, what skills are going to matter more and less in the future, and also just where things are going broadly. So how does that sound?

Karina Nguyen (00:05:55):
Sounds great. Thank you so much. Yeah, I was extremely lucky to join early days Anthropic and learned a lot of things there. And I joined OpenAI around eight months ago. So, yeah, I'm excited to dive more in into-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):
Okay, I'm going to definitely ask you about the differences between those, but I want to start more technical and just dive right in. I want to talk about model training. People always hear about models being trained, these big models, how much data takes, how long it takes, how much money toss it takes, how we're running out of data, which I want to talk about. Let me just ask you this question. What do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?

Karina Nguyen (00:06:36):
Model training is more an art than a science. And in a lot of ways we, as model trainers, think a lot about data quality. It's one of the most important things in model training is like how do you ensure the highest quality data for certain interaction model behavior that you want to create? But the way you debug models is actually very similar the way you debug software. So one of the things that I've learned early days at Anthropic was we've discovered especially this Claude 3 training, when you taught the model some of the soft-knowledge of, "Hey, you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world." But then at the same time you had data that taught the model some of the function calls, which is like, "This is how you set the alarm."

(00:07:30):
And so the model would get extremely confused about whether it can set an alarm, but it doesn't have a body in the physical world. So it's like the model gets confused and sometimes it'll over accuse. So sometimes it says, "Look, I don't know. Sorry, I cannot help you." And so there is always a balance trade off between how do you make the model to be more helpful for users, but also not being harmful in other scenarios. And so it's always about how do you make the model more robust and operate across a variety of diverse scenarios.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:09):
That is so funny. I never thought about that. Most of the data that it's trained on is kind of assuming it's like a human describing the world and how they operate. It assumes there's a body and you could do things, and the model is told you don't have a body.

Karina Nguyen (00:08:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):
Okay. I want to talk a little bit about data while we're on this topic. I know you have strong opinions here. There's this meme that models are going to stop getting smarter because they're running out of data. They're trained in a large part on the internet and there's only one internet and they've already been trained on it, what more can you show them about the world? And there's this trend of synthetic data, this term synthetic data. What is synthetic data? Why do you think it's important? Do you think it's going to work?

Karina Nguyen (00:08:47):
I think there are two questions here. We can unpack one at a time. But people say we are hitting the data wall. I think people think more in the terms of pre-trained large models that are trained on the entire internet to predict the next token. But what actually the model is learning during that process is actually how do you compress the compression algorithm here? The model learns to compress a lot of knowledge and it learns how to model the world. So the next prediction of the word, like, "Teach me how to drive," basically. And you only have a few words that will match that, a car. So the model actually learns about the world in itself. So it's like it's modeling human behavior, sometimes it's modeling... And when you talk to pre-trained models which are very, very large, they're actually extremely diverse and extremely creative because you can talk to almost any Reddit user through a pre-trained model.

(00:09:56):
But I think what's happening right now with new paradigm of o1 series is that the scaling in post-training itself is not hitting the wall. And that's because basically we went from raw data sets from pre-trained models to infinite amount of tasks that you can teach the model in the post-training world via reinforcement learning. So any task, for example, how to search the web, how to use the computer, how to write, wow, all sorts of tasks that you trying to teach the model all the different skills. And that's why we're saying there's no data wall or whatever, because there will be infinite amount of tasks and that's how the model becomes extremely super intelligent. And we are actually getting saturated in all benchmarks. 

(00:10:52):
So I think the bottleneck is actually in evaluations that we don't have all the frontier, like evals like, I don't know, GPQA, which is a Google-proof question answering, PhD level intelligence. The benchmark is getting to, I don't know, more than 60, 70%, which is what PhD gets. So it's literally hitting the wall in like evals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):
I want to follow both those threads. So the first is on this idea of synthetic data. Is a simple way to understand it, that the models are generating the data that future models are trained on and you ask it to generate all these ways of doing stuff, all these tasks as you described, and then the newer models trained on this data that the previous model generated?

Karina Nguyen (00:11:39):
Some tasks are synthetically curated. So this is an active research area is how can you synthetically construct new tasks with models to learn. Sometimes when you develop products, you get a lot of data from the product and user feedback and you can use that data too in this cross-training world. Sometimes you still want to use human data because actually some of the tasks can be really, really hard to teach. Experts only know certain knowledge about some chemicals or biological knowledge, so you actually need to tap into the experts' knowledge a lot. So yeah, I think to me synthetic data training is more for product... It's a rapid model iteration for similar product outcomes. And we can dive more into it, but the way we made Canvas and tasks and new product features for ChatGPT was mostly done by synthetic training.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:52):
Let's actually get into that. That's really interesting. I want to talk about evals, but let's follow that thread. So talk about how this helped you create Canvas.

Karina Nguyen (00:12:56):
So when I first came to OpenAI, I really had this idea of, "Okay, it would be really cool for ChatGPT to actually change the visual interface but also change the way it is with people." So going from being a chatbot to more of a collaborative agent, and the collaborator is a step towards more genetic systems that become innovators ultimately. And so the entire team of applied engineers, designers, products, research got formed in the air almost out of nothing. It's just like a collection of people who just got together and we rapidly started iterating with each other. 

(00:13:46):
Actually Canvas is one of the... I would say the first project at OpenAI, where researchers and applying engineers started working together from the very beginning of the product development cycle. And I think there's a lot of things that we have learned on the way, but I definitely came with the mindset of, "We need to do a really rapid model situation such that it would be much easier for engineers to work with the latest model possible, but also learn from user feedback or early internal dog food. How do we improve the model very rapidly?"

(00:14:28):
And it's really hard to kind of like figure out how people... when you deploy a product, how people would be able to use it. And so the way you synthetically train the model is physically figuring out what are the most core behaviors that you wanted the product feature to do. And for Canvas, for example, it came down to three main behaviors. It was how do you trigger Canvas for prompts like, "Write me a long essay," when the user intention is mostly iterating over long documents? Or, "Write me a piece of code," or when to not trigger Canvas for prompts like, "Can you tell me more about President..." I don't know, some of the general questions. So you don't want to trigger Canvas because the user intention is mostly getting answer, not necessarily iterate over the long document. 

(00:15:28):
The second behavior is how do we teach the model to update the document when the user asks? So one of the behaviors that we taught the model is actually have some agency and autonomy to literally go to the document and select specific sections and either delete it or edit, so highlight it and rewrite certain sections. Sometimes the user would just say, "Change the second paragraph to be something friendlier," and we would have to teach the model to literally find the second paragraph in the document and change it to a friendly tone. So basically you teach both how to trigger edit itself, but also how do you teach the model to get higher quality edit for the document?

(00:16:21):
In case of coding, for example, there's also the question of how good the model is of completely rewriting the document, versus having a very specific target edits. So that's another layer of decision boundary within edit itself is, "Let's select the entire document and rewrite completely, or do you want to have a very targeted custom behavior." And when we first launched the model, we would bias the model towards more rewrites because we saw the quality of the rewrites were much higher. But over time you are shifting based on user feedback and what you're learning from iterative deployment.

(00:17:02):
Lastly, the third behavior that we taught synthetically the model is how to make comments on any document. So the way we used that is we would use o1 model to seem a way of user conversation, let's say like, "Write me a document about XYZ." But then we used o1 to produce the document and then we injected user prompt to be like, "Oh, make some comments, critique my piece of writing or critique this piece of writing that you just made." And then we taught the model to make comments on the document on very specific [inaudible 00:17:45] So it's also what kind of comments you want the model to make. Do they make sense or not? How do you teach the quality of that? And it all came down to measuring progress via very robust evals. But, yeah, this is how you used o1 and a synthetic data generation for the training.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:07):
Okay, that's so interesting. So you talk about this idea of teaching the model and you mentioned how it's using synthetic data to teach the model different behaviors is a simple way to think about it. Basically that's where you do that by showing it what success looks like using basically evals. Is that the simple way to think about it? Like, "Here's what you doing this successfully would look like," and that teaches it, "Okay, I see this is what I should be doing [inaudible 00:18:31]"

Karina Nguyen (00:18:30):
Yeah, great. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, you got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:33):
Okay, got it. I want to start unpacking what your day-to-day looks like as you're building these sort of things. Is it like you sitting there talking to some version of ChatGPT, crafting these evals?

Karina Nguyen (00:18:44):
Sometimes I do that. Sometimes I do sit with ChatGPT. Actually, I think I learned this so much from Anthropic, is people spend so much time prompting models and where quality's a really bad batch all the time, and you actually get a lot of new ideas of how do you make the model better? It's like, "This response is kind of weird. Why's it doing this?" And you start debugging or something, or you start figuring out new methods of how do you teach the model to respond in the different way, have better personality, let's say. 

(00:19:19):
So it's the same thing of how personality is made in the models with those. It's very similar methods. But, yes, I think my time at OpenAI have changed. I think when I first came, I was mostly research IC work so I was like building a lot of... I was running code, training models, write evals, working with PMs and designers to learn, teach them how to even think about evaluation. I think that was really cool experience and I think it was just like an adoption of, "How do we do this product management of AI feature for our AI models?" Yeah, but now it's mostly management and mentorship. I'm still doing IC research code up to 4:00 PM, although. But I just kind of changed. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
All right, don't talk too much about being a manager.

Karina Nguyen (00:20:23):
Okay. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):
Because everyone's in firing their managers. "Who needs managers anymore?" That's what I hear now. Just kidding. It's interesting that so much of your time was spent on teaching product teams how evals integrate and how important it is. And I've heard this a few times and I haven't personally experienced it yet, so I think it's an important thread to follow is just how writing these evaluations is going to become increasingly an important part of the job of product teams, especially when they're building AI features and working with LLMs. So can you just talk a bit more about what that looks like? Is it sitting there with an Excel spreadsheet basically showing, "Here's the input, here's the output, here's how good the result was"? Talk about what that actually looks like very practically.

Karina Nguyen (00:21:02):
It certainly depends on what you're developing, but there are various types of evaluations. Sometimes I do ask product managers, or there's also new roles that we have, model designers, to go through some of the user feedback maybe or think of various user conversations that should have triggered... Under these circumstances, it should trigger Canvas. And then you have this ground truth label of, "Okay with this conversation it should look trigger Canvas, under this conversation it should not trigger Canvas." And you have this very deterministic kind of eval that for decision-making behaviors is like this.

(00:21:46):
When we were launching tasks, for example, how do you make correct schedules is actually really hard for the model. But we built out some of the deterministic evaluations that is like, "Okay, if the user says 7:00 PM, the model should say 7:00 PM." So if you can have deterministic evals whether it's pass or fail. And the way it works is all the... Sometimes I ask product managers to just go create a double sheet, have different tabs and what's the current behavior, what's the ideal behavior and why, and some notes. 

(00:22:27):
And sometimes they usually use it with evals, sometimes we use it for training. Because if you give the spreadsheet to o1 model, it can probably figure out how to teach itself a good behavior. And I think there are second type of evals that is more prevalent is human evaluations. And you can have specific trainers or you can have internal people to when you have a conversation of the prompt and then you have various completion of models, you choose the win rate. Which model is the best? Which model produce the highest quality comment or edit? And then you can have continuous win rates. And as you develop new models it should always win over the previous models. So it depends on what you want to measure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):
So interesting. Basically what I'm hearing, and there's something I'm learning about as I talk to people, is product development might move from this, "Here's a spec PRD, let's build it together and then cool, let's review it. Are we happy with this?" From that to, "Hey, AI, build this thing for me and here's what correct looks like," and I'm spending all my time on what does correct look like on evals essentially. 

Karina Nguyen (00:23:47):
You definitely want to measure progress of your model and this is where evals is, is because you can have prompted model as a baseline already. And the most robust evals is the one where prompted baselines get the lowest score or something. And then because then you know if you're trained a good model, then it should just hill climb on that eval all the time, while not also regressing on other intelligence evals. That's what I'm saying, it's more of an art than science. It's like, "Okay, if you optimize the model for this behavior, you don't want to brain damage in other areas of intelligence or..." This is happening all the time in every lab, in every research team. 

(00:24:35):
I would say prompting is also a way to prototype new product ideas. Early days at Anthropic when I was working file uploads feature, I remember I was just prompting the model to just... I remember we were launching a hundred key contexts. I was just prototyping this in their local browser. I did the demo. People really, really loved it. And they just wanted API for file uploads or something. And then that's when it clicked to me, and also one of the blog posts a long time ago, it clicked on me prompting is a new way of product development or prototyping for designers and for product managers. 

(00:25:20):
For example, one of the features that I want to do is have a personalized starter prompts. So whenever you come to Claude, it should recommend you starter prompts based on what your interests are. And so you can literally do it prompting for that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:42):
Mm-hmm. To experiment with that. 

Karina Nguyen (00:25:44):
Another feature was generating titles for the conversations. It's a very small micro experience but I'm really proud of. The way we did that was we took five latest conversation from the model, asked the model, "What's the style of the user?" And then for the next new conversation, the generated title will be of the same style. It's just like really little micro experiences like this. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):
That's so cool. Did you do that at Anthropic or at OpenAI?

Karina Nguyen (00:26:14):
At Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:16):
Okay, cool. I love the file upload feature that Claude has by the way. ChatGPT doesn't have that yet, is that right?

Karina Nguyen (00:26:16):
I think has the way. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:23):
[inaudible 00:26:23]

Karina Nguyen (00:26:22):
I think the way it's implement is very different though.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:25):
Okay. Maybe it's the PDF feature, because I use it all the time with Claude.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:28):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:28):
Okay.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:28):
That's cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):
Somebody needs to get on that. Main, it's wild how many features you built that I use every day and that many people use every day. This prototyping point you made is really important. It's something that comes up a ton on this podcast also of how that... is maybe the way that AI has most impacted the job of product builders recently is just prototyping instead of going from showing just like, "Here's a PRD, here's a design." PMs are more and more just, "Here's the prototype with the idea that I have," and it's working. You can play with it.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:54):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
Yeah. Okay, I want to spend a little more time on how you operate. So you talked about you built this in launch of this tasks feature, is that the way to describe your tasks?

Karina Nguyen (00:27:04):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:06):
So talk about how that emerged and let's better understand just how you collaborate with product teams and how OpenAI works in that way, whatever you can share there.

Karina Nguyen (00:27:14):
I think Canvas and tasks are going into the bucket of projects where it's more short or medium terms. And actually the way Canvas and tasks came about to be was it started with one person prototyping and creating a spec. It's kind of like PRD. It's like creating a spec of the behavior of the model. I don't think tasks is extremely groundbreaking feature necessarily. What makes it really cool is because the models are so general... Model can now search, they can write sci-fi stories, they can search for stocks, they can summarize the news every day. Because the models are so general giving something familiar to people that notifications is very familiar, having reminders is very familiar. So feeling like a form factor for the people who are very familiar, same as Canvas, Google Docs is very familiar, but then you add magical AI moment and it becomes very powerful.

(00:28:26):
But the way it comes usually operationally... Yeah, size is like a prototype, literally prompted prototype of how you would want the model to behave. For tasks, for example, you need to design... Literally design thinking is like okay, well, if the user says, "Remind me to go to lunch at 8:00 AM tomorrow," what information does the model need to extract from that prompt in order to create a reminder? And so this is how you design a spec for a new feature, like a tool. Canvas and tasks are all tools. So it's like how do you create the tool stack?

(00:29:09):
And then it's mostly like developing JSON schema. It was like, "Okay, from this problem maybe the model should extract the time that the user requested." And then you think about which format do you want the time to be? And then how do you want the model to notify you is basically the user should give instruction to the model. And then this instruction would fire off every day or something at that particular time. So, for example, if you say, "Every day I want to learn know about the latest AI news," the model should rewrite into, "Okay search for the latest AI news and this task will get fired at that particular type that the user requested."

(00:30:02):
And then your design is like tool spec. Actually, I don't know. I feel like sometimes it's through conversations I... Either people ask me to join the [inaudible 00:30:15] team and they're like, "Oh my god, we need researchers." Or like, "We need some support. We need to train the models," or sometimes. Canvas was mostly like I just pitched the idea of... It got staffed quite immediately during the break, so it's dependent on the project. And then usually with staffing is mostly a product manager, model designer, actual product designer, a couple of researchers and a bunch of applied engineers. Depends on the complexity of a project. And then for tasks it took, I don't know, like two months or so to go from zero to one basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:54):
Oh wow.

Karina Nguyen (00:30:54):
For Canvas this was like four, five months, I guess, to go from zero to one. And then you teach product managers how to build evals and maybe how do we not only ship the better feature, but how do we think longer term? What kind of cool features did you want tasks to have? I think it would be nice for tasks to be a little bit more personalized. It'd be nice to have to create tasks via voice on a mobile, right? This is how you get research roadmap right here is thinking how the feature will be developed in the future. 

(00:31:39):
And then from there it's like you start getting data sets. With evals, you want to make sure that goes well. And then you need to have a trade-off between what methods you want to use. And the reason why I really love relying purely on synthetic data instead of collecting data from humans is because it's much more scalable, it's cheap, less than half. You literally sample from the model and you teach the core behaviors of the models and that will generalize to all sorts of diverse coverage.

(00:32:15):
And when you launch the beta feature, you learn so much from the users that you can... All your synthetic sets can be shifted in the distribution and how the users behave on the product behavior. And this is how we improve. And this is what happened with Canvass too when we launched from beta to GA. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:34):
Okay.

(00:33:34):
Something that I want to help people understand, and I don't even 100% understand this, is what's the simplest way to understand the job of a researcher versus say a model designer and other folks involved? What's the simplest way to understand what researchers do at OpenAI?

Karina Nguyen (00:33:48):
So the project that I described are mostly product-oriented. Research is mostly product research. Another component of my team is actually more longer term exploratory projects. And it's more about developing new methods, understanding those methods under a variety of circumstances. So basically developing methods, you need to follow very similar recipe of building evals but it's much more sophisticated evals. You want to have outer distribution or if you want to measure generalization, you need to capture that. 

(00:34:26):
But it is basically more sciencey in a way where... If we talk about synthetic data, one of the hardest things about synthetic data is how do you make it more diverse? Diversity in synthetic data is one of the most important questions right now. And so it's like exploring ways to inject diversity as a general method that will work for all is one of the research explorations. Other ones is more developing new capabilities. I feel like it's always about you work on this new method and you have signs of life that it's working, either you think of how do you make it more general or you think of how do you make it very useful? And this is how the longer-term projects become more medium, short-term project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:15):
That makes sense. Essentially working on developing ways to make the model smarter, o4, o5, o6. New ways to... o1 was a big breakthrough, right? 

Karina Nguyen (00:35:25):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:25):
The way it operates where it's not just, "Here's your answer," it actually thinks and takes time to think through the process of coming up with an answer. Okay. 

Karina Nguyen (00:35:33):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:34):
Very helpful. Speaking of that, of thinking about the future, where things are going, I want to spend some time on just this insight that basically you are building the cutting edge of AI, at the very bleeding edge of where AI is going and where it is. And so I'm very curious to hear just your take on how you think things are going to change in the world and how people work based on where you see things are going. And I know it's a broad question, but let's say in the next three years, how do you see the world changing? How do you see people's way of working changing?

Karina Nguyen (00:36:08):
It's a very humbling experience to be in both labs, I guess. To me when I first came to Anthropic and I was like, "Oh no, I really love front-end engineering." And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized at that time it's like, "Oh my god, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps or something and so it can develop new features for the thing that I'm working." So it was kind of like this meta realization where it's like, "Oh my god, the world is actually changing." And when we first launched 100K context at that time, obviously I'm thinking about form factors that's like file uploads were very natural, very familiar to people. But you can imagine we could just make infinite chats in the Claude.ai app, as if it's 100K context. 

(00:37:04):
But because file uploads... It's like form follows function. It's like the form factor, the file uploads can enable people to just literally upload anything, the books, any reports, financial and ask any task to the model. And then I remember it was either enterprise customers, financial customers were really interested in that. It's like, "Oh wow." It's actually one of the very common tasks that people do in that setting. It's kind of crazy to see how some of the redundant tasks are getting automated basically by these smart models.

(00:37:48):
And they're entering the era where, I actually don't know for example sometimes if o1 gives me the correct answer or not because I'm not an expert in that field. And it's like, "I don't even know how to verify the outputs of the models." It's because all my experts know they can verify this. So, yes, so basically there are trends that are going on. The first trend is the cost of reasoning and intelligence is drastically going down.

(00:38:22):
I had a blog post about this. Maybe I should update on latest benchmarks, because at that time everybody was doing one benchmark and they'd be... quickly saturated the benchmarks. So I'm like, "Now we need to do the same plot but with another frontier eval." But the cost of intelligence is going down because it becomes that much cheaper. Small models are becoming even smarter than large models and that's because of the distillation research. 

(00:38:56):
This happened with Claude 3 Haiku. I was working with the training on the Claude 3 Haiku and I realized it was much smarter than Claude 2, which was way bigger, lots [inaudible 00:39:08]. But the power of small models become very intelligent and fast and cheap. We are moving towards that world. That has multiple implications, but the news is that people will have more access AI and that's really good. Builders and developers will have much better access to AI, but also it means all the work that has been bottlenecked by intelligence will be unblocked. 

(00:39:40):
I'm thinking about healthcare, right? Instead of going to a doctor, I can ask ChatGPT or give ChatGPT a list of symptoms and ask me, "Would I have a cold, flu, something else?" I can literally get the access to doctor almost. And there's been some research studies around that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
There was a New York Times story about that where they compared doctors to doctors using ChatGPT to just ChatGPT and just ChatGPT was the best of them. All doctors made it worse.

Karina Nguyen (00:40:18):
Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy, right? Education I think I would have dreamt if I had the tool like ChatGPT when I was young and would learn so much. But it's like people can now learn almost anything from these models. So they can learn new language, they can learn how to build new look apps and write anything they do want. It's humbling to have... launch Canvas and bring that thing to the people, enable them to do something else that they couldn't have ever before. There's something magical around this experience. 

(00:40:57):
Education will have massive implications. I guess like scientific research, I think it's the dream of any AI research is to automate AI research. It's kind of scary, I'd say, which makes me think that people management will stay. It's one of the hardest thing to... Emotional intelligence with the models, creativity in itself is one of the hardest things. So writers, I don't think people should be worried as much. I think will alleviate a lot of redundant tasks for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:34):
This is awesome. Okay, I want to follow this thread for sure. And it's funny that what you described as you were an engineer at Anthropic and you're like, "Okay, Claude is going to be very good at engineering. This isn't going to be a potentially career long term, so I'm going to move into research and AI is going to need me for a long time to build it, to make it smarter."

Karina Nguyen (00:41:53):
I would say we still have... I think Canvas team has still have really cool front engineers that are really people who really care about interaction, design, interacting experience. I don't think models are there yet I think if... But we can get the models to this top 1% of front-ends and things for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:16):
So what I want to move on to next along these lines is just, and this is just speculation, but what skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams in particular? So folks are listening and they're like, "Okay, this is scary. What should I be building now to help me stay ahead and not be in trouble down the road?" What skills do you think are going to be more and more important to build?

Karina Nguyen (00:42:42):
Yeah, I think creative thinking. You want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. Listening. You want to build something that the most general model will not replace you. And oftentimes you build something and you make it really, really good for specific set of users and actually the mode is now in your user feedback. The mode is more in whether you listen to them, whether you can rapidly iterate. The mode is in here. I don't think we are yet to... There are so many ideas, I think there's an abundance of ideas that you can work on. I wouldn't be worried. I feel like in fact I just think people in AI field are like... I wish they were a little bit more creative and connecting the dots across the print fields or something like that to develop really cool new generation and new paradigms of interactions with this AI.

(00:43:53):
I don't think we've cracked this problem at all. A couple of years ago I was telling some people, I was like, "You want to build for the future." So it's like it doesn't necessarily matter whether the model is good or not, good right now, but you can build product ideas such that by the time the models will be really good, it'll work really well. I think it just happened naturally. For example, at Anthropic the Claude artifacts... And I feel early days of Canvas was, back in 2022 before ChatGPT, writing ideas was our knowledge [inaudible 00:44:36]. But I feel like Claude 1.3 model itself was not there to have made really extreme good high quality edits. For example, like coding. 

(00:44:47):
And I feel like I see startups like Kaeser was doing super well. And that's because they iterate so fast. They invent new ways of training models. They move really fast. They listen to what users like, massive distributions. Yeah, it's kind of cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):
That's really helpful actually. So what I'm hearing is that soft skills essentially are going to be more and more important, powerful. You just talked about management, leading people, being creative and coming up with innovative insights, listening. There's a post I wrote that I'll link to where I try to analyze how AI will impact product management. And we're actually very aligned, and my sense was the same thing, that soft skills are going to become more and more important. And the things that are going to be replaced is the hard skills, which is interesting because usually people value the hard skills like coding, design, writing really well. And it's interesting that AI is actually really good at that because it's taking a bunch of data, synthesizing it and writing, creating a thing, versus all these fuzzy things around of what influences, convinces people to do things and aligning and listening, like you said, creativity, anything along those lines come up as I say that.

Karina Nguyen (00:46:01):
I think it's actually a really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or do really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write. I still think ChatGPT kind of sucks at writing and that's because it's bottlenecked by this creative reasoning. I think characterization is one of the most important... I think for a manager, I feel like... 

(00:46:28):
Actually, AI research progress is bottlenecked by management, research management. It's because you have constrained set of compute and you need to allocate the compute to the research paths that you feel the most convinced about. It was like you need to have a really high conviction in the research paths to put the compute, and it's more return on investment kind of situation. It's like, "Okay, I'm thinking a lot about across all my projects, which projects are higher priority?" Prioritization and also on the lower level, "Which experiments are really important to run right now and which are not?" and cut through the line. So I was thinking prioritization, communication, management. People skills like empathy, understanding people, collaboration.

(00:47:23):
I think Canvas wouldn't be an amazing launch if it wasn't about people and I think it's a wonderful group of people. And I get a chance to work with people like Lee Byron who's a co-creator at GraphQL and some of the best Apple designers. It's so cool to see... and how do you create this collaboration between people. It's just something that's still humane, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):
Let me just follow through a little bit. I imagine people listening are like, "Okay, but once we have AGI or SGI it's like it'll do all this." There's a world where like, "Why isn't all this done?" I think it's easy to just assume all that. I'm curious this idea of creativity and listening, why you think AI isn't good at it, other than it's just very hard to train it to do this well. Is there anything there of just why this is especially difficult for AI and LLMs to get good at?

Karina Nguyen (00:48:20):
I think currently it's difficult for many reasons. I think it's still an active research area and it's something that I think my team is working on. It's like, "Okay, how do we teach the models to be more creative in the writing?" And so I'm thinking this new paradigm of wise that the models think more should actually lead to better writing in itself. But when it comes down to idea generation or discriminating of what is a good visual design or not, I feel like it hasn't had learned examples from people to discriminate it very well. I do think it's because there are not that many people who are actually really... It's not accessible to models to learn from these people I guess. So I definitely think that's why it sucks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:19):
Yeah, that makes sense. Basically there's not enough of you yet, researchers teaching it to do these things, slash people that have incredible taste and creativity that can teach these things. You could argue this will come. 

Karina Nguyen (00:49:31):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:31):
But we don't need to keep going down that thread. Let me ask you a specific question. In this post I wrote, I made this argument that a lot of people disagreed with that strategy is something that AI tooling will become increasingly great at and take over. There's the sense that that's the thing that people will continue to be much better at and you can't offload to AI basically developing your strategy, telling you what to do to win. My case is, "Isn't strategy, just take all the inputs, all the data you have available, understand the world around you and come up with a plan to win?" It feels like AI and LLM would be incredibly smart at this. What's your take?

Karina Nguyen (00:50:10):
I think so too. I think again, you teach the model all sorts of tools and capabilities and reasoning and it's like when it comes down to... For Canvas right now, it would be very cool for the model just aggregate all the feedback from users, summarize me the top five most painful flows on user experiences. And then the model itself is very capable of thinking of knowing how it's been made, figure out how to create a dataset for itself to train on it. And I don't think that we are far away from that self-improvement, models becoming self-improved by...

(00:50:54):
That, and the part of development, is basically self-improving. It's kind of like its own organism or something. Again, like strategies, it's more like data analysis and coming up with... I think what models are really good at is connecting the dots, I think. It's like if you have user feedback from this source, but you also have an internal dashboard with metrics and then you have other feedback or input and then it can create a plan for you, recommendations even.  And I think this is one of the most common use cases for ChatGPT too, is coming up with these sort of things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
That makes sense essentially a human can only comprehend so much information at once and look at so much data at once to synthesize takeaways. And as you said, these context windows are huge now. Here's all the information, what's the most important thing I should do?

Karina Nguyen (00:51:59):
Yeah, same as scientific research. Ideally the model would be able to suggest ideas, new ideas, or iterate on the experimental given the empirical results of the previous experiments like how do you come up with new ideas or the methods?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:18):
Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, so just to close the loop on this conversation, this part of the thread is the skills you're suggesting people focus on building and leaning into is soft skills like creativity, managing influence, collaboration, looking for patterns. Is that generally where your mind is at?

Karina Nguyen (00:52:40):
Yeah, I'm thinking a lot about how do we make organizations more effectively and I think this is mostly management, I guess. It's like how do you organize research teams or generally teams combined... Compose teams such that they will be at their maximally succeed or at the maximal performance of what can possibly... We can literally create the next generation of computers. It's just the matter of conviction and the way you manage through that. It's scaling organizations or scaling product research, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:15):
Yeah, I think you're basically building this thing and not efficiently doing it is limiting the potential of the human species right now.

Karina Nguyen (00:53:16):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:26):
It's mismanagement within the research team in OpenAI and Anthropic and some of these other models.

Karina Nguyen (00:53:32):
Yeah, it's kind of crazy to think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
Holy moly. Okay, so speaking of Anthropic and OpenAI, you've worked at both. Very few people have worked at both companies and have seen how they operate. I'm curious just what you've noticed about the differences between these two, how they operate, how they think, how they approach stuff. What can you share along those lines?

Karina Nguyen (00:53:48):
It's more similar than different. Obviously there was a lot of... There are some differences always comes to nuances. I would say culture. I really love Anthropic and I have a lot of friends there. And I also love OpenAI and they still have a lot of friends though. So it's not about enemies. I feel like there's in AI, it's all like, "Yeah, they're competitors. There's enemies." It's actually like one big community of people doing the same thing. I would say what I've learned from Anthropic is this real care and craft towards model behavior, model craft, model training. 

(00:54:32):
And I've been thinking a lot about, "Okay, what makes Claude Claude and what makes ChatGPT ChatGPT?" And it's like I still have some sense of operational processes that leads to the outputs, to the model. It's the outputed model. And it's like the reason why Claude has so much more personality and is more like a librarian... I don't know. I don't know. I am visualizing Claude being like a librarian at some point, very nerdy or something. ... is because I feel like it's the reflection of the creators who are making this model. And a lot of details around the character and the personality and whether the model should follow up on this question or not. 

(00:55:19):
What's the correct ethical behavior for the model in these scenarios? A lot of crafts and curated datasets. This is where I learned that part of art, I guess, at Anthropic. I would say Anthropic is much smaller. When I joined it was, what, like 70 people? When I left it was tons of people. And obviously the culture changed so much. I really enjoyed being early days startup lives, and people knew each other as a family. But the culture shifted. 

(00:55:53):
I would say that I learned from Anthropic that they're much better at focusing and prioritization of... Very hardcore prioritization, I guess. And they need to do it. But I think OpenAI's much more innovative and much more risk-takers in terms of product or research. Actually, in way your full-time job can be just teaching the model how to be creative writers. And it's like there's some luxury in this research freedom that comes with scale, maybe. I don't know. I'd say I have much more creative product freedom to do almost anything, I guess, within OpenAI, evolve ChatGPT into the vision that we want. It's more probably bottoms-up, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):
Yeah, that's how I was thinking about it. It feels like OpenAI is more bottoms-up, distributed, people bubble up ideas, try stuff. And that leads to more products launching, I imagine more things just kind of being tried versus more of a, "Let's just make sure everything we do is awesome and great and craft and thinking deeply about every investment."

Karina Nguyen (00:57:08):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):
That's really interesting. I've never heard it described this way. Karina, we've covered so much ground. This is going to help a lot of people with so many ways of thinking about where the future's going. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I'm curious if there's anything else that you think might be helpful to share or get into?

Karina Nguyen (00:57:23):
One of my regrets, I guess, when I was early days at Anthropic was that... I think there was some luxury of the time, because pre-ChatGPT, to actually come in with a bunch of ideas and prototype almost every day. And I think that we did a lot of cool ideas like Claude, and Slack was actually one of the first tool-usey products. It's like Claude could operate in your workplace now. It's kind of cool because you can add Claude to summarize the thread. So maybe you have an entire conversation with someone and then you want a summary of what happened you can ask Claude, "Summarize this." 

(00:58:07):
Also, it was really fun to iterate on the model itself. It's like when you just talk to the model in Slack forever. It created some social element, it was kind like [inaudible 00:58:19] and this Discord, people learned so much about prompting and how to work with Claude. Actually, one of the features that was early tasks prototype is every Monday Claude would just summarize the entire channel. Or every Friday we'd just summarize a bunch of channels and give the news about the organization, or something. 

(00:58:48):
And it's kind of like really cool form factor. I think thinking about form factor's a really important question in AI, especially we haven't even figured out how do we create an awesome product experience with o-series models. It's like the paradigm between synchronous real time give an answer paradigm into more asynchronous paradigm of agents working on the background. But then now the question is the agents should build trust with you, right? And trust builds over time, which is like with humans. And you start this collaboration which is why this collaboration model with you and the model is so important because you build trust and the model learns from your preferences so that it can become more personalized and it will start predicting the next action that you want to take on the computer or something. And it's more predictive, much more... We went from personal computers to personal model basically here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):
Why is it not a thing? That seems like such an obvious feature that every LLM should have as a Slack bot version of them. Is that a thing I can help you install? Or is that not a thing right now?

Karina Nguyen (01:00:03):
I know that Claude and Slack was sunset in 2023 or something. I think it was after ChatGPT was mostly the focus on customer use cases or enterprise use cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):
Mm-hmm. Bummer. 

Karina Nguyen (01:00:19):
I think the form factor of Claude and Slack was kind of constrained a little bit when you want to talk about new features.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:28):
Bummer. I want that.

Karina Nguyen (01:00:30):
I know that ChatGPT had Slackbar tools. I don't know, maybe it will come back sometime.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:35):
All right, I would pay for that. Any other memories from that time of early days? Because that's a really special place to have been is early days Anthropic. Any other memories or stories from that time that might be interesting to share?

Karina Nguyen (01:00:48):
I think the very first launch when we felt... When click from use, again, was 100K context launch is when the models could input the entire book and give you a summary of the book or something. Or the financial... or catalog multi files financial reports and then give you an answer to the question, to very specific questions. I think there was something in there that was kind like, "Oh my god, this is a really cool new capability." Not model capability, but more like the capabilities that came from the product form factor itself rather than the model capability as much. 

(01:01:34):
I think other prototypes that we were thinking about... There's one part having a Claude workspaces and it's kind of the same idea of Claude and I would have this shared workspace and that share workspace is like a document and we can iterate on the document. And I feel like sometimes the ideas, [inaudible 01:01:55] and they're locked for two years, just like in this case. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):
It's interesting, there's these milestones that kind of open up our view of what is happening and where things are going. ChatGPT think was the first of just like, "Wow, this is much better than I would've thought." You talked about 100K context windows where you could upload a book and ask it questions and have it summarize. I actually use that all the time. When I have interview guests and they wrote a book, I sometimes don't have time to read the whole book. So I use it to help me understand what the most interesting parts are. And then I actually dive into the book, just to be clear. And then, I don't know, maybe voice was another one where you could talk to say ChatGPT. Is there any other moments there that you're like, "Wow, this is much better than I thought it was going to be?"

Karina Nguyen (01:02:39):
Yeah, I think the computer use agents, like the model operating the desktop. And you can essentially think of new kind of experience where the model can learn the way you browse. And from that preference it can just browse as just like you. It's kind of simulated persona. And it's actually very similar to the idea of like, "Okay, maybe Sam Altman doesn't have a lot of time. Maybe I want to talk to his simulation and ask..." Or, for example, I really appreciate some of the technical mentorship. Yeah, cool. But he doesn't have a lot of time so it's like I really want to ask him this questions. How do you respond with simulated environments like this would be really cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:37):
That's a great place to plug Lennybot, have one of those. It's trained on all of my podcasts and newsletters. 

Karina Nguyen (01:03:42):
Oh, cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):
It sits on many models. I don't know which exactly they use, but it's exactly that. And it's not even me, it's all the guests that have been on the podcast and on newsletter as I wrote. And you could just ask it, "How do I grow my product? How do I develop a strategy?" And it's actually shockingly good.

Karina Nguyen (01:03:58):
Do you feel like it reflects who you are?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
Yeah. 

Karina Nguyen (01:03:58):
Or would it be... Okay. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):
The best part of it is you can talk to it. There's an ElevenLabs voice version that's trained on my voice from this podcast, and it's actually very good and people have told me they sit there for hours talking to it. 

Karina Nguyen (01:04:15):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):
And somebody told it, "Interview me like I am on Lenny's podcast, ask me questions about my career." And he did a half hour podcast episode with Lennybot.

Karina Nguyen (01:04:24):
Oh my god, that's so fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:27):
It's incredible. Future is wild.

Karina Nguyen (01:04:29):
Yeah. I think content transformation is... I would imagine sometime when you generate a sci-fi story in Canvas, you can transform this into audiobook where you have very natural content transformation of one media to another media. I think one of my earliest inspiration is one of the last episodes of Westworld where, I don't want to spoil, but where Dolores comes to her work at that time and she comes to this new workspace and she starts writing a story. And then as she writes a story, a 3D, virtual reality, starts creating on the fly. So I kind of want to create that. Kind of cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):
Wow. Speaking of medium, I guess I was wondering if I should go in this direct or not, but real quick. Kevin Weill/Kevin Weill, I don't know exactly how to pronounce his last name, the CPO of OpenAI.

Karina Nguyen (01:05:35):
Kevin Weill, uh-huh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:37):
Is it Weill or Weill? 

Karina Nguyen (01:05:37):
I think Weill. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:39):
Weill. Okay. Okay. Let's just say that. We'll go with that. 

Karina Nguyen (01:05:40):
I hope, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):
He did a panel at the Lenny and Friends Summit last year and he made this really fascinating point that chat is a really interesting interface for these tools because they're just getting smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter. And chat continues to work as a paradigm to just interact with them, similar to a human. You could talk to Albert Einstein. You could talk to someone not very smart and it's all conversation still. And so it's a really flexible way to interact with increasingly good intelligence. At some point it'll not be so great, and you were talking about all these ways that you're adding additional ways to interact. But it's interesting chat proved to be a really powerful layer on top of all this stuff. 

Karina Nguyen (01:06:22):
Yeah, that's real cool. I feel like chat also has social element which is very humane. It's like, yeah, you sometimes want to get into group chat. And having conversations with AI is kind of like a group chat in itself, as messaging. Actually, this idea of how do you build features like this? I see tasks as this general feature that will scale very nicely as the models would develop new capabilities themselves. The models will be able to do better searches and create new... come up with more creative writing on render, react apps and like HTML apps. And you can have everyday new puzzle for you, every day continue the story from the previous days. It scales very nicely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:14):
You mentioned something as we were getting into this extra section that we ended up going down is this idea of the agents using a computer. I know this is actually something you are going to launch today, the day we're recording it, which will be out by the time this comes out, called Operator, can you talk about this very cool feature that people will have access to?

Karina Nguyen (01:07:33):
Yeah, so I unfortunately did not work on that, but I'm really, really excited about this launch. It's basically an agent that can complete the task in its own virtual computer, in its own virtual environment. You can do any literally task like order me a book on Amazon. And then ideally the model will either follow up with you which book do you want, or know you so well that it start recommending, "Oh, here is the five books that I might recommend you to buy." And then you hit, "Yeah, help me buy." And then the model goes off into its own virtual little browser and complete the task and buy the book on the Amazon. And then if you give the model credentials, credit cards, obviously it comes with a lot of trust and safety, then it will just complete the thing for you. It's a virtual assistant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:37):
It's interesting how this just sounds like obviously this should happen. Why is this not yet a thing? Which is also mind-blowing that we're just assuming this should exist. Just some AI doing things for you on a computer we just ask it to do. 

Karina Nguyen (01:08:37):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):
It's absurd.

Karina Nguyen (01:08:51):
It's actually really hard. And I think you're still cracking this, but feel like... I don't know if you use Tuple like a pair programming product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
No.

Karina Nguyen (01:09:04):
But at Anthropic we loved pair programming, so if you used-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):
Oh yeah, Shopify uses this. I remember it came up on a podcast episode.

Karina Nguyen (01:09:10):
Oh, nice. Yeah, so it is a very cool product where you can just call anyone at any time and then share screen and the other person can have access to the screen or start literally operating your computer. And it's very realtime... The allegiance is very... it's very high quality. And it's just like I kind of want the same. I want to pair program with my model and the model should even talk to me. Draw very specific section in my code and just go to tell me... Obviously teach me and we can have different modes. It's like right, this is a product right here for you. I don't know. Some people should build that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:58):
It sounds like a startup just got birthed-

Karina Nguyen (01:09:59):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:00):
... from someone listening to this. You mentioned that it's very hard to do this agent controlling a computer as you and helping out. What makes it so hard for whatever, however much you can explain briefly?

Karina Nguyen (01:10:11):
Much of it is because right now the model's operating on pixels instead of language or whatnot. Pixels is actually really, really hard. The models [inaudible 01:10:25] perception, or visual perception. I think there's still a lot of multimodal research that's going on, but I think language scaled so much easier compared to multimodal because of that.

(01:10:38):
Another thing that I guess my team is working that is how do you derive human intent very correctly? It's like sometimes does the model know enough information to ask a follow-up question or to complete the task? You don't want an agent to go off for 10 minutes and then come back with an answer that you didn't even want. That actually creates much more worse user experience. And this comes with teaching the model people skills. It's like, "What do people like? Kind of like creating the mental model of the user and care about the user in order to ask certain questions. Actually, that part is hard to do for the models.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):
That relates to what we talked about earlier where this kind of the soft skill, people skills piece is not where these models are strong yet.

Karina Nguyen (01:11:34):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):
Okay. I'm going to skip the lightning round. I want to ask just one question from the lightning round, something fun. 

Karina Nguyen (01:11:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
Okay, so when AI replaces your job, Karina, I'm curious what you're... And it gives you a stipend, gives you a monthly stipend. Here's your salary for the month. What would you want to do? What do you want to spend your time on? What will you be doing in this future world?

Karina Nguyen (01:11:57):
I've been thinking about this a lot times. I feel like I have a lot of jobs options. I would love to be a writer, I think. I think that would be super cool. You should write short stories, sci-fi stories, novels. I really like art history, so you know those conservationists in the museums who just try to preserve art paintings, but just painting through a long day? 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:28):
Mm-hmm. 

Karina Nguyen (01:12:29):
I think that would be really cool to do. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:36):
That sounds beautiful.

Karina Nguyen (01:12:36):
I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
What I'm hearing is you need to Nerf these models to not get very good at writing so that you can continue... Although at that point you don't need to do it from... You don't need people to buy it, you're just doing it for fun, so it doesn't even matter if they're incredibly good at writing or art conservation. Oh man, what an episode of our conversation. What a wild time we're living in. Karina, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Karina Nguyen (01:13:06):
You can find me, I'm on Twitter it's KarinaNguyen. You can also shoot me an email on my website. And my team is hiring and so I'm looking for research engineers, research scientists, as well as machine learning engineers, people who come from product engineers who want to learn model training. I'm actually hiring for my team. My team is called Frontier Product Research, and we train models, we develop new methods but for product oriented outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:38):
What a place to work. Holy moly. What's the best way for people to apply for these very lucrative roles?

Karina Nguyen (01:13:46):
I think you can shoot me a DM on Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
Okay. 

Karina Nguyen (01:13:51):
Or I'm yet to create a job description for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:51):
Okay. This is the job description.

Karina Nguyen (01:13:58):
Or you can apply into post training team. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:58):
Okay. You're going to get a flood of DMs. I hope you're prepared. Karina, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.

Karina Nguyen (01:14:03):
Thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):
Bye, everyone. 

Karina Nguyen (01:14:05):

# Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus | Karri Saarinen (co-founder, designer, CEO)

## Transcript

Karri Saarinen (00:00:00):
My belief is that, like any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters. What happens is whenever there's a new paradigm, I don't know, like the mobile or the web or something the first iterations of those products existing there, they don't have to be super well designed necessarily because they are the first.

(00:00:19):
Then, as you build the 100,000 different email clients, any email client now has to be pretty good to be even considered an email client. It's like the bar is so high. I think today it's almost a very basic thing now. Pretty much from the very beginning, you need pretty high level design for people to even pay attention or consider you seriously.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Karri Saarinen. Karri was the founding designer at Coinbase, principal designer at Airbnb, co-founder of two previous startups, and most recently is the co-founder and CEO of Linear, which I'm fairly confident is the fastest growing and most beloved issue tracking tool in the world and something that a growing number of product teams are using to build their own product.

(00:01:07):
Karri and his team are building their company and their product in a really unique way with a huge focus on craft and quality, no AB tests, no metrics-based goals, instead a focus on taste and opinions. Also, no durable cross-functional teams, instead teams assemble around a project and then disperse once it's done. Also, they have just one product manager as the head of product and that's it. In our conversation, Karri shares how he built a culture around quality and craft, how he makes trade-offs, and how he operationalizes quality and thoughtfulness where design can be a differentiator in competing against incumbents.

(00:01:42):
We talk about something called the linear method of building product, which is big on building opinionated software, working in consistent cycles amongst other principles. We also get into Linear's unique hiring approach, which involves a paid work trial where candidates work alongside the team for a number of days instead of just having an interview, also a glimpse into how Linear got their first 10 customers, found product market fit, and scaled their growth engine.

Karri Saarinen (00:04:29):
Thanks, Lenny. It's great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:31):
Maybe to start, set a little context, can you just explain what is Linear? What does Linear do? Then, share maybe a few stats of just the scale of Linear at this point.

Karri Saarinen (00:04:41):
Linear is the project and issue tracking system that software companies and technical teams love to use. We help software companies to build software. We started 2019. Today some of the top growth companies like Block, Vercel, Ramp, Retool, Mercury, and Softstack are building with Linear. We also additionally have lots of other companies, thousands of other companies using Linear. These companies can be a very early stage team like some companies just graduated from YC or a public company.

(00:05:17):
Just briefly, why we created Linear is that, like you said, I worked with you at Airbnb and before that I worked at Coinbase. Before that, I had my own startup. All of us founders, there's three of us, we had a similar path where we worked in multiple different companies in different stages. What we saw often is that the tools available for managing software projects weren't really cutting it. I think a lot of them felt very clunky or complex or just like they had this legacy way of thinking about software development. We just felt like we should do something about it. With Linear, we set out to build this most frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development. I'm also happy to share that we've been profitable the last two years. We also have this thing where we actually have this net negative lifetime burn rate, which means that we just have more cash in the bank today than we have raised. I think with a lot of startups usually the normal way is that you raise money and then you need to spend it to build it. I think since we were able to build a business pretty early on, we've been able to be in this position that actually we haven't spent any money on building the business.

Lenny (00:06:43):
That is insane. I didn't even know that. For all those reasons, a lot of founders and a lot of product leaders look up to the way Linear builds product and the way you think about product. To frame this conversation, there's three areas I want to dive into. One is just how you approach building product. Two is how you go about building the team and the business in general and then three is just how you grow Linear. To start, I want to talk about craft.

(00:07:11):
Clearly, one of the biggest reasons that people look up to Linear and use Linear is the quality of the user experience and the product. I know your team puts a lot of emphasis on craft and user experience. I imagine that also comes at the cost of some trade-offs like it takes probably longer to get stuff out the door. You're probably losing sales because people are waiting for a feature and you're not ready to launch it yet. You want to make it better. What have you learned about creating space for craft and building product that is really, really great?

Karri Saarinen (00:07:40):
I think it's interesting that those things you mentioned like hiring, building business, and building product and craft, I think that all of those are somewhat related to each other. What I can say about the product craft per se is it definitely starts with the people. On the hiring front, we always look for people that care about it. As a business, why we really care about it is that we see that cooperation only happens if people use the product and our product, which is supposed to help the cooperation, coordination.

(00:08:14):
If there's friction or the experience isn't that great or there's little paper cuts, I think it gets really annoying for people to use. We think for the business to be successful the quality and the craft is very important. There's definitely trade-offs sometimes. There can be for example timelines like we are about to launch something and then for example I or someone else goes to look at it and sees, "Oh, this doesn't feel right and we should fix it so I don't think we should launch this now."

(00:08:43):
Sometimes it does definitely push the timelines, but this might be days. It's not like we need to redo everything. The other way we think about it is we are actually very okay pushing things out to ourselves and for a small group of customers if they opt into that. Whenever we build a new feature one of the things is we don't want to spend tons of time upfront just designing it, then polishing it perfectly.

(00:09:13):
We actually believe that when you start building the thing you actually start realizing more how it should work and how it should be better. A lot of times with the teams we tell them, "Just put it there in, I don't know, the first week almost. After you have some designs in place or some design ideas, just put it into the app and ship it to production." It's only visible to us so we internally can test it out.

(00:09:40):
Then, I think the next stage is we look for a customer that could be interested in this feature or we just ask people to opt in to some better program. In those stages, the experience can be a little janky or it's not that polished, but we're okay with it because we are saying, "It's not finished. We just want to get your feedback early so we can make it better." Once we get to the full general release, then we pay more attention to the actual polish or the craft.

Lenny (00:10:11):
That is so interesting. I didn't know you do that. You actually go ahead and launch things really early to a select group of people that want the early stuff. Then, did you say that you find one customer to co-create and help evolve the feature and change it?

Karri Saarinen (00:10:26):
Usually it can be one or it's three or five or 10. Often, especially with the larger company facing features, we usually do try to find a large company because sometimes it's hard to imagine these things, how they should work. It's better if someone is willing to work with us to explain, "Okay, this is how we do something." For example, we work this way with Vercel in that there was some changes they wanted to see in the roadmap feature. We worked with them to improve it and then they could give us feedback along the way.

Lenny (00:11:02):
That is so interesting because I think people seeing Linear from the outside, it feels like you just take the time you need to build something awesome. Then, it launches and it's amazing and it's great, but it turns out that isn't exactly how you build. You actually do launch things really early and people don't necessarily see it until it's done, but there's this whole process behind the scenes.

Karri Saarinen (00:11:21):
I think sometimes people think that craft is about perfecting things and perfecting them in a very organized way or very early on. The downside with this perfection mindset is that it can be sometimes hard to put anything out because nothing is ever fully perfect. We try to balance this thinking with the fact that we should be always pushing things out very quickly, but then also fixing them, improving them very quickly.

(00:11:51):
It's almost like the opposite idea, but then we try to combine that and I think it's been working well. Generally, in the company there's not necessarily a lot of reviews or something that we always review everything that gets shipped this way because we do want people to feel that they can put something in the app and then we can try it out. It's more like let's just try it out, but then we do need to look at it again before we release it to everyone.

Lenny (00:12:25):
A lot of founders, a lot of product leaders, a lot of designers definitely want to create space for craft and making products really great, something they're really proud of, but in practice it's really hard. Very few teams and companies do this. Is there anything else you've learned about creating space for this sort of thing and prioritizing it for founders that are listening that are trying to instill more and more of this or do you have to be a designer CO like Karri and really it's hard to do otherwise?

Karri Saarinen (00:12:53):
I don't think actually. It's not purely coming from me. I think all of us founders like Jori and Tuomas additionally, their background is engineering, but I would say I think they spend even more time on the details than sometimes I do. I think very early on when it was the three of us I would be the one doing the broad strokes designs like this is how the UI works and this is how some of the things work. They were the ones that were like, "Oh, there should be animation here and there should be this kind of thing here."

(00:13:27):
I think it's like that DNA I think comes from all of us. I think with the craft it always starts with people need to care about it. If it's not valued in the company, then it's very hard for anyone to do because people don't feel like it's valued. I gave this advice to some founder. He was asking me about it and in their case their founders were coming from different companies. Maybe this one founder came from Airbnb and then the other ones came from Facebook and Amazon. For example, I think Facebook and Amazon have a very different culture on quality or craft or shipping. I think it's what I said to them. You need to align on it. It's like you cannot run a company with multiple different kinds of cultures. I think I made some points like why the quality is important for certain products and you should all believe in that and then instill that with everyone you hire. The other thing I would say that we like to do is we actually don't have much PMs in the company.

(00:14:32):
We only have one and we can talk about more about it. One of the things I think that happens is when you build a team and you start creating these very specific roles for everything I think that often the PM can be the ones figuring things out and making decisions and guiding the team, but they're not the ones building the feature. They're not there looking at it the whole day like where does this button go or how does it work? I think a lot of that, this craft for us happens when we give the project team this ownership and the project team is just engineering and design.

(00:15:11):
Then, when they start building that feature they start seeing these opportunities that this thing could be better. A good example of this is one of our engineers, Andreas. When we were building this right click menu in the app so you can click different things and under that you have sub-menus. Mac OS does this well where it's when you open that menu you hover on the menu and then you want to go to the sub-menu. You hover to the right. You don't have to go exactly horizontally to get into that menu.

(00:15:44):
You can actually go diagonally or you don't actually have to hit the menu exactly. There's this safe zone, but a lot of software just implements like, "Hey, let's do this menu. Let's make the sub-menu." It only works if you exactly hover over the menu. Then, what happens is the user often misses with few pixels what they were trying to do. What Andreas did, which we didn't tell him to do, is like, "Yeah, this kind of sucks and we should make this better."

(00:16:12):
He figured out a way to create those safe areas that are dynamic based on the sub-menu positioning and everything. It's much easier now. You can go diagonally to the actual thing you want to go to. I think these things happen when you give people more of the ownership of the project and also the space to do that and then you also have leadership or generally the company culture that values the quality or the craft.

Lenny (00:16:42):
I got to follow this thread. There's a couple of questions I want to ask. You have one product manager. Would you call him the head of product?

Karri Saarinen (00:16:48):
Yeah, Nan Yu, he is the head of product.

Lenny (00:16:52):
Awesome, what made you decide to hire him and even have any PMs?

Karri Saarinen (00:16:56):
We started to see that we have enough features and areas of the product and also the team speaker that it's hard to keep aligned on all of these things or even keep track of things. Initially, we actually hired Nan as a contractor to help us with this insights data tool. We have this data tool feature built in Linear so you can get data on what's happening in the workspace. For us founders, we realized none of us, we are not super experienced in data tools. We need someone to help out.

(00:17:34):
Luckily, Nan, we knew him and he actually worked at Mode, which is a data tool. We initially hired him like, "Can you help us figure out what exactly should this data tool and how should it work?" I think there's different ways of doing that. I think always the easiest way is let's just copy what some other company is doing, but we didn't want to do that. We wanted to figure out what is actually a useful way to use this data or get this data?

(00:18:01):
He helped us with that and then we saw this could be useful in other larger areas or overall with the whole product it's like we might have these kind of questions. What should we exactly be thinking around here and why and how would we define this direction and then help the teams to also align on it? To us, it's more like he figures out the direction of the product and steers some of the efforts and not like he's there in every meeting and making every decision or writing every spec or something like that.

Lenny (00:18:38):
Another question along this line, because there's a lot of PMs listening that are going to be like, "Oh, shit, these guys don't need PMs or PM is over, product management dead." Just another question along these lines, somebody needs to do the work that a PM does basically, right? There's all these things that is on the plate of a product manager when they're at a company and if they're not there, other people have to do those things. What I'm hearing is basically you give those responsibilities to the engineers, designer, and maybe other functions within the team. Is that right?

Karri Saarinen (00:19:06):
Yeah, I mean definitely I think what it means is, and there's definitely a trade-off. I think sometimes when companies specialize roles a lot it's because it's more efficient. If the engineer spends 100% of their time coding something, then it's like they're using their skillset to the max. Then, we just think that in order to build quality things or build things in a certain way it's actually better if people actually also spend some time thinking about things and not just executing.

(00:19:35):
Yes, for every project there's a project lead. That lead can be engineer or designer. It's not a formal role or it's not based on your whatever level or it's just like you need to be certain title that you can be that. It's more like an assignment that now you are responsible getting the project started and working together with the team, figuring it out, and then communicating changes or communicating how that progress happens.

(00:20:06):
Definitely it means that the engineers or designers also have to do these things and they do need to communicate and they do need to think about the scope or things. It's a different way of doing things. Also, not everyone wants to do that, which is fine, but we on the hiring front try to hire people that are interested in the broader scope than just the specific skillset that they have.

Lenny (00:20:36):
I think those last two points are really essential. One, people often don't want to do this work and they are happy to offload it to a potential product manager. The fact that say engineers have to do all these boring PM things like communicate timelines and keep PR specs aligned and make sure timelines are hit and all that stuff and run meetings, a lot of people don't want to do that.

(00:20:57):
A lot of times they do and I think in this case people seem to really want to be doing that. The other is I think you need a really high caliber team that's very product-minded and the hiring bar needs to be very, very high for say engineers and designers to want to do all these things and be good at them. I think those are two necessary ingredients for this to work out.

Karri Saarinen (00:21:16):
Sure.

Lenny (00:21:16):
For teams that want to try this approach, especially startups that are starting out and maybe not excited about hiring product managers, is there anything else that you think is essential or important to functioning well without any product managers? You're at around 50 people at this point?

Karri Saarinen (00:21:32):
We're around 50. Probably the only thing I would say is it's the hiring front that you really need to spend more time on it. Basically, you cannot really interview engineers only for the engineering skills. You also have to interview them for the product skills. Obviously, you cannot I think expect that people have some. If you do some PM interview for them, they're not going to have the same skillset or the same understanding of the concepts or something.

(00:21:59):
The way we have done it in the past is basically I might interview them about the product. I'm not a technical person per se. I will just ask them questions about how did they do something or how do they think about something? It's similar to other roles too. We just look for does this person have opinions about products and how they work? Can they form opinions and can they use their own judgment at times? Then, can they communicate or articulate those things as well?

Lenny (00:22:30):
Awesome, I was just thinking it's interesting that a tool that, I don't think it's designed specifically for product managers, but essentially for building products like the infrastructure for building product in a team is built by a company that has one PM and very few PMs.

Karri Saarinen (00:22:43):
I mean I think in some ways I would say that with Linear we're trying to help the whole company and I think engineers is probably the largest user group of the product. I think in some ways we want to make the PM's job easier in that they have to spend less time managing everything or the day-to-day because the engineers are actually using the product and they're updating the things. For the PMs, it would be much more easier to get what is the state of things and maybe trust that much more because people actually use the product.

(00:23:18):
In some ways, I think we are trying to make it easier for everyone, easier for the engineers. They can focus more on their work. Then, for PMs I think we're trying to make it so that they can also focus more on other things than just, I don't know, managing the tool that they use. I think that's not the most important job of a PM. I think they should be thinking more of the, I don't know, bigger picture or the other problems or figuring out the next features or something.

Lenny (00:23:47):
Just one more question along these lines, there's other companies like Stripe I think waited until 200 employees to hire I think their first product manager. Snapchat I think is famous for something around that. Do you have any sense of if you think this might change, when you think you might hire more product managers? Is there a plan here or is it just see how it goes as you grow?

Karri Saarinen (00:24:05):
I think we'll definitely hire more. It's I think like what I said before. I think we like to see the PM's smarts operating on a higher level. The whole company, I think the way we are trying to build it is we have less people, but people who are more high caliber and can think about larger scope than what their current role is.

(00:24:29):
I think we're just trying to build smaller units, but more effective units, which is I think where the PMs go. There would be also less of them and they're not there at every level. I think in the future as the company grows and the team grows and the product grows, we might have several PMs that are focusing on or looking at specific areas or specific types of things of the product or specific customers or something like that.

Lenny (00:24:57):
Awesome, that was a tangent because I could not go in that direction, but I want to come back to design again and craft.

Lenny (00:25:00):
... not go in that direction, but I want to come back to design again and craft. So it feels like Linear, one of the reasons you guys have been successful is design and experience is basically a huge differentiator from other products and there's always this question of can design be enough of a differentiator in specific markets? Is there always an opportunity to build a significantly better product experience and have a real shot at disrupting an incumbent? Do you have any sense of when design can be enough of a differentiator? And this is coming from a founder trend aside, should we go big on design and experience or should we invest in distribution or new technology or something along those lines? Any thoughts there?

Karri Saarinen (00:25:41):
My belief is that any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters. I think it's fairly easy to see in different, even in software or in other industries. It's like what happens is whenever there's a new paradigm, I don't know, it's the mobile or the web or something, the first iterations of those products existing there, they don't have to be super well-designed necessarily because they're the first. But then as you build the hundreds, thousand different email clients, any email client now has to be pretty good to be even considered an email client. The bar is so high.

(00:26:23):
I think today the startups, I don't know if you look at the webpage Google launched with or the webpage YouTube launched with or some of these older companies, they were very basic. If you launch that website today, no one would really pay attention. So I think the design is, it's almost like a very basic thing now, that from pretty much from the very beginning you need pretty high level design for people to even pay attention or consider you seriously.

(00:26:56):
And I think it's not necessarily fair because sometimes it's like maybe the product is really good but they didn't have a designer or they didn't have time to do it and then people just dismiss it because it doesn't seem like something that they interest them. So I think that's the first thing is I think it is, and it's going to be more and more important. But I would also say design is never going to be the reason why a company is successful. It's like the company still has to have some other things. The product still needs to be something, it needs to be better in some ways or it needs to be different in some ways.

(00:27:36):
And then a design is just enabling some of these things, enable and similar to technology, it's like if you have good technology, it's easier to do certain things and the product works better in some ways than you having a bad technology or bad infrastructure.

(00:27:53):
So similar to design, I think if you have a good design or even a good brand, people are drawn into it and then it makes some user acquisition or user retention or just even people perception of the product better. I think an example is packaging and products, is like Apple or a lot of companies spend a lot of time effort into the packaging because it's kind of already sets the expectations for the user who is receiving the product. It's like even before you use the product, you start thinking that this is a high quality product and I'm going to love it. And then when you actually have it, then you actually might feel that way, unless the product is really bad and then you wouldn't feel that way.

(00:28:40):
So I think similarly, with startups or SaaS, it's like your landing page or some of the other things. It's like they are already communicating something to the user and they're setting the expectations and then I think that that can be very useful thing, especially early on when no one really knows you or knows the product or cares about you. So I think especially, I feel like design can be very good leverage in the beginning.

Lenny (00:29:08):
I think that's such an interesting insight, especially that first thing you said around how the more often and the more crowded the spaces, the more opportunity there is for design to be a differentiator. Is that roughly how you think about it?

Karri Saarinen (00:29:21):
Yeah. So I mean just think about, I don't know, any product category, basically people have then a lot of choices and then they how do they make choices? Maybe there's a specific thing they want, but a lot of people don't necessarily know what is the specific feature I want from this software. So it's more like, well what is the best one? What is the highest quality one? And if you put things side by side and people see things, people are visual. So then the design can be one of those things, it stands out, it's like, "Well, that looks the best or that looks the most quality product to me, so I'm going to use that one." When people have a lot of choices, they probably will pick the one that looks most interesting.

(00:30:04):
Then I think there is, the second part is the brand, which is something that if you can build a brand, then I think it's even the product almost doesn't matter, it becomes this kind of default. I don't know again, like Apple or Nike, it's like yeah, there's all kinds of shoes you can buy, but there's a reason for someone to buy Nike shoes other than some random brand. Even if the random brand would be actually a better shoe, they still buy Nike because they, I don't know, like the brand. So then I think both the design of the product but also the design of the brand can be very strong things that pull people to your company or to the product.

Lenny (00:30:48):
Is there anything you've learned about just building a brand over the course of building Linear, something you find to be really important in actually building that perception that Linear is really great and amazing

Karri Saarinen (00:30:59):
To me, I think the brand should be always authentic and it should, I think even if people can't articulate it, if people start to feel like something is off, I think there can be companies or startups, they think about brands like, oh brand is the logo or the colors of the website or something. And then they do the same thing and some other company does and then they think, "Okay, now we have a brand." But you actually didn't think about what's your brand, what is the message or voice you want to talk about? And it doesn't also, the brand doesn't happen overnight.

(00:31:34):
So it's basically just you start in the beginning and when you start a company you don't have no brand and so you have to create it and you create it over time by the things you do, the things you say, how you say them and how do you approach things, how do you treat customers, how do you build the website or the product? All of these things starts to build this idea, what does this company mean to me in people's heads?

(00:32:02):
I know we both worked at Airbnb and I think Brian Chesky is, I think the brand was probably the most important thing for him. And I don't know how many hours or meetings or conversations there was about the brand and the brand was always, it's part of everything the company does. Because it's true. It's like, yeah, you could book things like places to stay in a lot of places on the web, but when people think about, "Oh, I want to stay in some cool place," they're going to think about Airbnb. It's like they're not going to think about those other places. So that's the power of the brand, people stop thinking about the other things or they start understanding, okay, this is the thing for this.

Lenny (00:32:43):
And it's part of the reason Airbnb's been able to build a direct destination where people aren't Googling, I want to stay in a home. They're like airbnb.com, which gives Airbnb such a massive advantage not having to run ads on Facebook and Google or SEO. It's just like people know Airbnb and they just go straight there. And there's very few sites where people go, "I'm going to go straight there and look for some," knowing that they can also compare hotels on all these other sites.

(00:33:08):
Coming back to design briefly, just very practically, how do you guys do design reviews? Just how do you actually go about reviewing what's going at, and then this may be too big a question, but just whatever you can share here, is just how do you know when it's done? How do you know when it's ready and approved? Karri sealed, checkbox, ready to go.

Karri Saarinen (00:33:26):
We've been exploring different ways of doing this. I think today, I still run the design team, so I do see some of the designs on a weekly basis and then, or one of the other co-founders or head of product, we are basically the sponsors for the projects. So then we are responsible reviewing the work. And so we might just have a meeting where we go through, okay, well let's go through the demo and people can explain what's going on and how they think about it and why. And then we might have feedback, okay, this seems strange or something, and then just after that I might just go into the product myself and try it out. And then what happens sometimes, it's in the initial stages, obviously we're not going to start fixing everything, it's just more like let's try to get the main concept there and figure out how it works.

(00:34:27):
But then before we are launching it, I might just go in and try it out and try the different states and click it around. And sometimes I find things, like we were building this threading to comments and then when it looked all good in the demos and stuff, and then I went to try it and try different lengths of messages and stuff and then I start to see, oh, sometimes the animations are kind of janky or it's just off. They don't go the right way, the screen doesn't scroll exactly right. So then I just captured those things and send it to the team. And so we had to pull back the release a little bit until those things were fixed. That one was, it's very, I think a simple concept and it's very known concept like, okay, this is how threading comments works. So that was mostly about, okay, what's the execution of this?

(00:35:22):
But then we have projects where we are not sure exactly how this should work and we can try it ourselves. We also have to see how companies use it. So something like we built this feature project updates and it's a common thing companies do. It's like you need to write an update on a project. Is it yellow, green, red? And companies have very different ways of doing this in different tools and we just thought, well, I think it would be really nice if it's inside Linear and the team, when they work on a project, they can write the update, Linear can also capture some of the stats, what actually happened. I think with that feature it's been working well, but then also now it'd be exploring. It's like after using it a while we think, oh actually, if there could be more robust way of following these updates. Maybe the leadership could just get these updates over email or maybe when you have a lot of updates you should have a search or a filtering system or something. So I think a lot of times we just think, okay, this is the scope of it for now and we are okay launching this and the execution is good. But we know that this is not the fully figured out version and we just need to see people trying it out and see the feedback.

Lenny (00:36:36):
So it sounds like on the decision of whether it goes out or not, it's kind of this intuitive feeling from your actual experience trying it out, feeling gut level, this is ready or this needs a little work?

Karri Saarinen (00:36:46):
Yeah, I would say a lot of things that we do is more like that but we don't do AP testing or we don't do specific, go follow certain metrics or something. Sometimes we do have telemetry or we can look at how people use certain things and we sometimes do that, but that's not usually the goal we have in mind, like, yeah, we should move this number this much. So it's more about based on the understanding of the problem we have and based on the [inaudible 00:37:16], what we think is right, is this the right solution and is this a good enough solution to be released to the customers?

Lenny (00:37:24):
One more question along this thread is how do you actually structure these reviews? It sounds like you go straight to a prototype. Is there a design review phase? Is it all kind of informal and people just review, here's what we need your feedback on?

Karri Saarinen (00:37:38):
So projects don't necessarily have specific states to them, but I would say roughly, usually we do start with design. So there's some explorations on the design, there's different ways that we could approach this or sometimes there's just one way because pretty clear. But then what I said before, is that we do try to get into the building phase as quickly as possible because then we can also see is this direction actually reasonable and is there some problems it causes or how does it just generally feel here? So I think that there isn't specific review stages. It's more like, yeah, let's check on this project every week or every two weeks and then before releasing, let's also make a review of it and really test it out, is it the quality we want?

Lenny (00:38:34):
Awesome. So that's a good segue to another area I wanted to spend some time, which is the Linear Method. You espouse this way of building product that you call the Linear Method, which you publish online and willing to in the show notes. And I just want to ask a few questions around this way of building product. One is, you are big on this idea of building opinionated software. Can you talk about just what does that mean and then maybe give an example or two of how you actually have done that at Linear?

Karri Saarinen (00:39:02):
So first with the Linear Method, why did we create it in the first place? Is we just believe that there is more of this modern ways of building software and thinking about it. And we wanted to share some of our thinking on it. And that's also, it relates to how we built Linear as well. So you might understand why we make some choices because this is the way we think about making these choices. So we are trying to share our thinking behind the product and also just like, here's the product and figure it out.

(00:39:33):
So the opinionated piece, I personally have this belief that productivity software should be, and especially company software should be opinionated. I think that what the productivity software is trying to do is make people productive. And I think what productive means is you actually do something that matters for the company, which is, I don't know, build some new feature or fix something or design something.

(00:40:02):
All of those things are eventually, they provide some kind of value for the customer. I think there is this ideas or notions in the world that flexible software is great. I'm like, I think it can be great sometimes. But what happens is people start spending a lot of time figuring things out. Like, how does this feature work? You can use it in 10 different ways and then every team or everyone figures out the different way of doing it.

(00:40:27):
So our thinking is we like to provide this good default or good opinions. Like, this is how the feature works and this is how the workflow works. So you, as a user or as a team don't have to think about it and you can focus on the work you do. And the other thing is, my design mantra is always design something for someone. It is very hard to design everything for everyone because you just end up with a very generalized solution. So then what we are trying to do with the opinionated solution is that that's the best solution or at the most optimized solution we think of.

(00:41:06):
And then when you use it, hopefully you agree and you can feel that it's most optimized. So being opinionated, I think the value it provides people is you don't have to think too much or spend more time on the tool than you do on your actual work.

Lenny (00:41:23):
And then another core element of the Linear Method is something you call cycles. I know Linear is all around this idea of creating cycles and working in cycles. Can you talk about what is a cycle and how it works at Linear?

Karri Saarinen (00:41:35):
So for example, the cycles, it's optional, not that the whole team has to use it or not that the whole company has to use it, but it's there as you can turn it on or off. But basically, I think why we created cycles is that I think any team that works on software or some other products, you always have almost infinite list of things to do and that list gets longer every day. And it can be sometimes very distracting for the individual or for the team to decide, there's a new thing coming in, should we work on that or should we work on this other thing we decided in the past? So the cycles is just a way to say that for the next week or the next two weeks or whatever timeframe, we are going to work on these things and these other things we think are the priority or the focus for this timeframe.

(00:42:27):
And then the team can try to focus on those things. Now if something happens, like I don't know, we really need to jump on this other thing. At least there was some kind of initial state that we decided before we want to do these things and then now something else happened and so now we have to go on this thing. So you have an answer when someone comes to you to ask, "Why didn't you do this other thing before?" Then you can say, "Well, we did decide to do that, but then something happened and we had to do this other thing."

(00:42:56):
So the cycles, it's very similar to sprints, but we like to call it cycles because we are not really sprinting anywhere. The cycles also run on automated schedule. So it's like you don't have to think about which day does it start? Or every time, set it up manually so it just runs automatically. And so it's just meant to help the team to focus on, let's just focus on this few things and forget about the infinite list of other things that are in the background.

Lenny (00:43:27):
You mentioned earlier that you don't set metrics goals and so let me dig into that a little bit. Is that true? You don't really have number goals for features for launches and things like that? And so let me start there and then I have a follow-up question.

Karri Saarinen (00:43:41):
So we might have a company level goal sometimes, for example, weekly active users, that's a metric we want to increase or something. But in terms of specific features, we don't have goals for those. And the reason is that I think a product like us or a system that is used by different kinds of companies, and it's like a system made of multiple different parts and it's not necessarily like you want to optimize any specific thing about it. Also, companies are a little bit different, so their usage of different features can differ because they just operate slightly differently or their team size is different or the setup of the team is different or the culture is different.

(00:44:27):
So I think for example, I don't know, some Instagram or some of these apps, it's like, yeah, we need to drive engagement and that's the main feature. That's the main metric for every feature. We don't actually have that. We just think that there should be features that help companies and sometimes we can look at the metrics before we start working on it, like let's see what this state of things are, but we don't necessarily want to set, oh, we need to increase this specific metric by X. It's more like we want to solve this problem. And ideally, the success what it looks like customers agree that the problem is solved or they enjoy the solution and it's not like that the metrics went up.

Lenny (00:45:08):
So just to summarize so far, you have no metrics, you have no experiments, you have essentially no PMs, just one product leader. You spend a lot of time on design and craft and making things awesome. I'm curious just what you think it takes to make a company work in that way? Because this is pretty different from how a lot of other founders think and a lot of other product teams work.

Karri Saarinen (00:45:32):
We like to talk about this internally, I like this mixture of magic and science and how we described, there's always some level of science that we do. And I think some companies are very scientific on their product management that they like to measure everything and they do a lot of tests and things, but we just decided we don't think that's necessary or that's good for us. So the science for us, means that we do talk to users a lot and any project we start with, we do some level of user research and as founders, different people on the team, we might have weekly calls with customers or users. We also encourage everyone in the team, go to the customer Slack, they answer people questions. We have shared Slack channels with customers. Anyone, I sometimes go answer the questions there. I also see when they complain about something. I think the first part is the whole team has to be really understanding the product and the customers and the problems people are facing and have that empathy and as well as the understanding what is the state of things today.

(00:46:47):
And then we talk about that. And then sometimes we might pull up stats and see, oh, wonder, is there some kind of patterns we see, okay, these kind of companies are using this thing more and what do we think about it? But usually we have some kind of question we want to answer. It's like, I wonder what is going on. And then we look at it versus let's pull some metrics and then decide that we should increase this metric. And then the magic part is what happens when you build this understanding, everyone in the company builds. It's not like everyone has the same understanding, but everyone builds more of that customer and product understanding. Then we have discussions like what should we be doing or what decision we want to make here? Then everyone is much more informed of actual reality of the customers or the product.

(00:47:40):
And then we think you can much more use your intuition or thinking to do those decisions so you don't have to use data or metrics to back those things up. So I think the main thing is the whole company has to be with the customers or talk to them and then understand where the product might work well or where it might fall short.

Lenny (00:48:05):
That's what I imagined you were going to say, and I love hearing that. For someone that wants to create a similar culture, is there tactically anything you find, just understand if your employees and engineers, designers have enough of that context and really understand the problem?

Karri Saarinen (00:48:20):
I think it's always, different people in a company will have different understandings. It's not like you can expect everyone will every day go to see everything and has this. But we do sometimes sessions with the team or we do record videos with the customers, we write notes and we share this with people. I feel like again, it's fairly apparent, if you know your customers or the product, it's a very different way you can talk about it versus if you don't have any idea. I think if you don't have any idea, you probably don't even know what to say.

(00:48:59):
So I think it's apparent if people have that then, it's not like every project's like we need everyone to have this understanding. Probably, usually enough if one or two people have that understanding or have different understanding of different things. So I think again, I feel like it's a culture thing. I think the other thing is you just have to kind of believe in it.

(00:49:26):
I think sometimes people use data a lot or too much because they're worrying or they're afraid that, will I make the wrong choice? And I'm using data to make the choice for me. But then you might still feel like this is not the right choice, but the data is telling me is the right choice and then turns out maybe it was the right choice or not. But it's more like, again, like a practice thing. I think the company and you need to be okay that sometimes we make mistakes and we made the wrong choice and then we just can fix it. But at least we made that choice and the data didn't make that choice for us.

Lenny (00:50:03):
What's interesting about-

Karri Saarinen (00:50:00):
The data didn't make that choice for us.

Lenny (00:50:03):
What's interesting about this is if you've heard the episode on RAMP and how Ramp builds product with Geoff Charles, there's such different ways of building product. Ramp is all about velocity, shipping all the time, metrics, measuring everything. And your approach is almost the opposite. And I think what's interesting there, as a takeaway, is just there's many ways to do it. You just have to do it almost fully and you have to have really specific people. It feels like the people want to work in a certain way. And a lot of it I think also is the founder has to be natural to the way the founder operates and thinks about building and building a company.

Karri Saarinen (00:50:39):
Yeah, and for sure. And then if you look at successful companies and Amazon is very different than Apple in how they operate. And I think both of them are successful, but not in the same way.

(00:50:50):
So I think it's, again, it's like... Yeah, it's a decision you make as a company or as a founder, what kind company you want to build. I do think there is some aspects of the domain that you're in. What does that domain and the problem space require from that company? And for us, I think it's... I think we are in the retention business. And the trust business that ideally we have a company starting use Linear very early on and then they stay with us forever. And I think the only way we can do that is we need to continuously deliver them good quality product and maintain that trust that we are... That we don't fail them more or somehow otherwise mistreat them.

(00:51:36):
And I think some businesses are much more transactional where it's like, yeah, we just need to make this e-commerce sale. And then once it's done, we don't care what happens.

(00:51:47):
So our case, it's more like we really need to build this relationship over time. And then that's why I think some of the choices we make are also more about respecting the customer versus we're just wanting to drive the revenue of the company.

(00:53:06):
Something you're really good at personally is focus. I find that just trying to get you on this podcast was a lot of like, "Hey Karri. Hey, have you thought about this yet?" And I know that a lot of VCs are just reaching out to you all the time, all these really fan CVCs that are just trying to talk to you and get close to you. And I just know you're really good at avoiding shiny objects and staying really focused and really heads down. And I've always wanted to just ask you, how do you do that? Do you have any tricks, systems, processes, approaches to staying focused other than just ignore the inbox mostly?

Karri Saarinen (00:53:39):
Yeah. I don't think there's any complicated processes. And so I think one of the things, I was in YC in 2012 and one of the main things they say there is what you should be focusing on when you build a startup is talk to customers, build the product, exercise. And if you find yourself doing something else, then those three things, it's probably the wrong thing to do.

Lenny (00:54:02):
And the third one you said exercise or...

Karri Saarinen (00:54:03):
Yeah, yeah. And the exercise is that it's important for you to be healthy or not just burn yourself out. So I think it was a balance [inaudible 00:54:17] to that.

Lenny (00:54:17):
Love it.

Karri Saarinen (00:54:19):
So I'm doing those three things.

(00:54:23):
I think the thinking there is, I think we often as a company also talk about this, and very early on. And I use this the same way and I think the company can use it the same way. I think there's always things that you're supposed to do or it sounds like a good idea to do. And it could be like, yeah, come to this podcast. And I actually think before it wasn't like...

(00:54:47):
Or I always have this question, is this important to do now or is it important to maybe do later? So I think, for example, the question on this podcast is I didn't feel like it was important to do it earlier because we weren't at the stage or a scale or something that I think it'd be as interesting or something. So I think it was a better timing to do it later.

(00:55:09):
Similarly, when we built the product, initially we were just very focused on is this really important thing to do? There's always like, yeah, you could get SOC 2 security certificate. And we know that eventually we need to get it, but we don't need it today. So we just say no to that. And if customer asks for it, so we say we don't have it. And we'll have it one day but not now. And see, a lot of times people are like, "Okay, that's fine."

(00:55:38):
And then internally, we also talk about this, you knowing RPG games, you have the main quest lines and then you have the side quest lines. And we often talk about the companies avoid the side quests. There's always ideas people have and it's a good thing and it's like people have ideas, but then it might be like, "Yeah, let's make this T-shirt, so let's make this thing." And then we're like, "Well, does it help the customers? Does it help the product?" This sounds like a side quest to me, and basically means we shouldn't do it. This doesn't progress the main quest line, which is building this product and making it awesome for these customers.

(00:56:17):
So it's similar to me. It's like I operate this way personally too, that I think about "Is this important for the main quest line in building this company for me? Or is this something that I can ignore for now, or something that I can do later and it makes more sense then?"

Lenny (00:56:35):
That is such incredibly good advice. Basically ask yourself, "How important is this to do now? And is this the main quest or is this a side quest?" Amazing.

(00:56:47):
Okay, so let's talk about hiring. As with most areas, you're very, very, very deliberate about hiring. The bar is so insanely high at Linear, and you also hire very few people. So just a few questions along these lines, just one is when you're hiring people, what do you look for that you think maybe other people are not looking for enough? And where do you spend a lot of time?

Karri Saarinen (00:57:09):
I think one of the things all of us founders saw in this high-growth company is that sometimes the high growth, especially on the employee side, is not that great. It can create a lot of chaos or just messiness. Or just generally in my past and working in companies, it's almost never... It was always easier to work with a smaller team, very high quality people than with a very large team of more average people. It's almost like it's always faster and better output when you have a much more smaller team.

(00:57:43):
That was the thing with Linear too, is we just believe that you can actually build better with less people than you can with more people. So that's the basic belief we have. So then when it goes to hiring, we've been taking very slow steps on it that in almost the first year we didn't hire anyone. Then the second year we hired a couple people, and then the second year we hired a few more. We never more than doubled in a year. And that's been our guideline that we shouldn't more than double. And this might be something we change in the future that we actually might do less than that.

(00:58:20):
But when we look into hiring, it is a couple things. One is also that it obviously depends on the role, but basically I would say with every role, we often talk about there needs to be some taste or some this kind of understanding of how things are done or what's the... People have more a broader perspective than whatever their role is.

(00:58:46):
So we talked about the engineering before that they do need to do some of this BM type of stuff. And so what we look for in them is that if they have some of this skill set or product thinking, or they can articulate why some choices are better than some others, or in their past did they disagree with some of the company's choices or the team's choices, or... So we want to have this... Obviously they need to be good developers, but also do they have this a product sensibility, or do they have a judgment around that?

(00:59:22):
And this goes similar to, for example, a marketing hire is... We think about, yeah, we do need the marketing skill sets, but then we also want to see that this person also maybe is a good storyteller or they have this appreciation for writing or stories or they have a taste of what's interesting and what's not.

(00:59:46):
So I think, or when we hire operations person, we also like to see that they maybe have understanding on HR and maybe it's not their role, but they understand it. And what happens is when you have these people that are a little bit more than their title, it's like the company is, I think, much more easier to manage because it's like people can pick up things more easily or they can work together more easily because everyone has more like a shared areas or you rarely get to the point people say it's not my job. It's more like people understand, okay, yeah, I'm kind of in operations, but today I need to help on this HR thing, which is okay. And so that's what we look for people is they are more than their... They can take more scope than their skill set would assume, or what normally is expected from them.

Lenny (01:00:45):
So essentially you're looking for these Venn diagram overlappings across different functions and teammates.

Karri Saarinen (01:00:51):
Yeah. I think the other thing is, like I said before, is we want to build much... I think a company that has less employees, which means that it's... Like I said before, we don't want that many specialized roles or too specific areas of ownership or something. We just think that we could build this... We could have less people and those people can take on more scope and they can own more scope.

(01:01:19):
I think traditionally, I feel like in companies, how do you get more scope is that you advance in the levels of the company because there's a lot of different teams and different levels. And then to get any kind of scope, you need to rise into this higher levels. And what we try to do is you don't actually have to have that many levels, but people can just already, when they start, they can start owning more areas.

(01:01:45):
And I think that can be much more also interesting, not to everyone, but I think interesting to many people. And it's kind of like how I also always felt about us being a designer is I didn't feel like my job is purely just looking at the designs. I also thought I actually need to be helping this business or helping this other area as well. So I think it's just also natural to me.

Lenny (01:02:10):
Awesome. So one thing you didn't mention is you have a really unique way of interviewing, which is a paid work trial. Can you just talk about what that is? And also just while you're in that area, you talked about testing for product sensibility, so whatever you can share how you actually do that would be awesome.

Karri Saarinen (01:02:27):
Yeah. So we do with all of the employees, we've done a paid work trial and depends on the role, what it looks like, how long it is and depends on also sometimes on the person. But basically we do fairly standard interview loops where we test... We have some hiring manager interviews and then skill interviews or tests. And then the last step of the process is the work trial.

(01:02:53):
And basically, they basically come as a mini contractor to the company, and we give them a very usually fairly vague problem statements. If you're an engineer, it's like, hey, there's this feature that needs to be built. How would you build it? Then go build it. And so basically they need to first understand the problem. Then they need to scope it down to something that they can do in the timeframe that they have. And then they actually go... They get the access to a code base. They can actually go and go and build a version of it. And then at the end they can present the work they did.

(01:03:29):
And why we do this is that we just seeing that it's a very good way to see for both of us, both for the company and the candidates to see how we work together. And I think for the candidate, what they can see is, what kind of company are you joining, what is it like to work here, and what is [inaudible 01:03:53] ownership or how do I approach this?

(01:03:55):
I think a lot of engineers also like that they see the code base and they're like, oh wow, this is really clean and it's not some kind of spaghetti code type of thing situation. So I think it helps the candidates as well understand what are they signing off for, which I think can be very risky sometimes. Especially with startups, it's really hard to tell how the startup is operating just from the interviews. And in large companies, I think things are more standardized. So I think they're more similar and it's easier to make that choice. But with startups, it can be very different how companies operate.

Lenny (01:04:32):
Yeah. That is so unique and I rarely hear of a company being able to hire that way. I imagine one of the reasons you can get away with that where people don't have a full-time job for a while, while we're doing a paid trial is because Linear is such an enticing place to work. I imagine for a lot of companies they can't really do that. But I guess any thoughts on just maybe more companies can actually pull this off?

Karri Saarinen (01:04:51):
Yeah, I think it's always like if you don't ask, you don't know. I think in our case that's just been the standard and we try to work with the candidate. Let's figure out maybe we do it on the weekend or maybe we do it some other vacation holiday or something. So there can be ways we can schedule it so that it causes as little kind of problems to the candidate as possible.

(01:05:16):
And I think we only had only a few people probably have ever declined it. It's not like I think everyone else has been, at least after the fact, they've been happy that they did it because they felt like they had a much better sense of the company they're joining. And then also during that workshop, they can actually join our meetings, they get access to our Slack and Notion, and they also have one-on-one chats with some of the other people on the team.

(01:05:43):
So they already get to know people. So it's a good way for them to evaluate us as well. And then for us, it's obviously we can see... What is important for us to see is how does this person operate in this kind of environment and how do they approach problems? How do they think and are they able to make progress in a very short timeframe, which I always think it's very important for startups. In large companies, you have maybe all the time in the world to do stuff. But I think any kind of startup, even with us when we take our time doing things sometimes, it's still important. We can do things quickly if we have to.

Lenny (01:06:21):
Super cool. Just to close the thread on product sensibility, is there anything you could share of just how you actually help understand someone's strength and ability there?

Karri Saarinen (01:06:30):
Yeah. I wouldn't say we have some kind of very scientific or some special way figure it out for this. So I think a lot of it, it's like a discussion of... And I often think ask people that... Ask about their projects and I try to go deeper. It's like why was this decision made? Why do you think the decision was made? And I might ask, "Do you think it was the right decision or did you agree on it?" Or ask about what you think you would have done differently or something.

(01:07:04):
So I think it's more like I'm trying to... In this area and what their answers is. And people's answers can be very different levels. Some people might be, "Yeah, I didn't like it. Which yeah, it's not opinion, but it's not based on anything. It's just like you didn't like it. You should be able to expand on it saying well, I don't like it because in this case it would not work well for this kind of users or in this kind of context or for this kind of purposes.

(01:07:33):
So they have more of this reasoning or some kind of rational why they think this way and they can articulate that. So I think that's what we often testing for is can they do this and how well they can do it. Then there can be very wide ranges of how people do it. And when you see someone who really thinks about this stuff, it's very clear to see that they can just talk about it forever and they can go deeper and deeper. And then some people that maybe haven't had the experience or don't think this way, they're like, yeah, I don't really know. I just built it and then seemed fine.

Lenny (01:08:18):
Let's transition to the third area I wanted to spend some time on, which is growth. And basically I'd love to just understand how Linear grows and what you figured out around growth, especially in B2B SaaS.

(01:08:29):
So our first question here is just how long did it take from starting to work on Linear to launching, say, V1, something that a number of people can use?

Karri Saarinen (01:08:38):
So we started officially in 2019. Some, I think, months before that we were already exploring and prototyping the product. So I think we prototyped different kinds of designs a little bit.

(01:08:52):
And then we also, one of the things we really wanted to solve is we wanted to make the application really fast. And the way we figured out we do that is we have more of this local-based data structure where all the data lives in the client, and then it gets synced on the backends with this delta [inaudible 01:09:13].

(01:09:13):
And back then, we were just exploring different off-the-shelf solutions and systems, but there was nothing really there, so we ended up building our own. And so we spent some time prototyping that. And then once we officially, I think, started working on the company in April 2019, and then we announced the company roughly mid-April, and we had this little website up with the wait list. And then I think by May we could use it ourselves. And then we started inviting some friends to try it out.

(01:09:49):
But then I think in June, I think we started more inviting people from the wait list. And around June, July, I think we had about, I don't know, 100, 200 users on it and maybe about 10 companies or something. And then we were in this private beta stage for almost a year. And the way we did it was just like we had this wait list of people on the wait list. There was few survey questions, like what kind of tools you use today and then why do you want to use Linear and what's the company size?

(01:10:23):
And we invited people based on... We invited more smaller companies using the tools we currently supported. And then also I was trying to see who is more interested versus just, I don't know, I just want to try it out type of people. And then a year later, in June, we launched it publicly. And back then maybe we already had, I don't know, several hundred of companies using it. And then we also launched the pricing and I think almost all of them... Maybe one company didn't subscribe, but everyone else subscribed to that paid plan.

Lenny (01:11:01):
Okay. There's a number of really interesting things here. So one is you're in private beta for a year and then a year later, you launched. How long was that period between starting to incubate and starting to build to that private beta milestone?

Karri Saarinen (01:11:16):
Yeah, I think it's just a few months. I think just-

Lenny (01:11:19):
Just a few months of building the V1?

Karri Saarinen (01:11:21):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:11:22):
Wow, okay. I thought it was a lot longer. That is so interesting. Okay. What a team you've got over there.

(01:11:27):
Okay. And then this survey piece is really interesting. I've heard a little bit about this story. So essentially you launched it on Twitter. You had kind of a following. Your founders had a bit of a following, so I think that helped build up the initial wait list.

(01:11:39):
But what you did there wasn't just like, hey, go sign up for a wait list and you just add email addresses. It's a survey asking them what tools they use, whether it's GitHub or something else, and then also the size of the company and their interest. And that helped you basically prioritize who to go after and who to onboard. Is that right?

Karri Saarinen (01:11:56):
Yeah. And the reason we did it, because we know that we didn't support everything and what I said before and the focus is we want to also be focused on let's just build a version that can work for some people or some companies. We don't have to try to address everyone in the world in the first months of the business. And even before, after that. So it was very selective process. And I think we were fortunate that we were able to get people sign up on a wait list and I think after a month or so we had maybe 4,000 people on the wait list.

(01:12:34):
And then we had this internal... I think initially it was just a very manual process, but eventually we built this invite tool that we could just send invites. But in the beginning, I would go read the actual surveys in a spreadsheet, then I copied the email, and then I emailed them the invite link from my personal email. And then I would just email them after a few days or a week and it's like, "Hey, what do you think?"

(01:13:01):
And the reason we... And so we would invite only like... In the beginning, we maybe invited like 10 people a week. And eventually we increased those amounts. But the reason we did it that way was that we thought that if you just invite everyone at once or a lot of people at once, all of those people are going to probably hit the same problems in this kind of software that is very early stage. So I don't know. They hit the same bug or the same problem in the software. So then they will all send us feedback like, hey, there's this problem. And then we felt like it was a wasted effort.

(01:13:36):
So we would just do these cohorts. Let's invite these people and then they say, hey, this is a problem. This doesn't work, or something. Then we go fix that. Then after we fix that, we invite the next cohort of people. Then they say, well, there's this thing that is needed or this doesn't work, then we fix that.

(01:13:54):
So for that year, we did these cohorts and then always get the feedback from the cohort saying this is wrong or this doesn't work, and then we'll fix that. So eventually, I think it was much more... I think an effective way of doing the initial development than just inviting or letting everyone to use the product right at the beginning.

Lenny (01:14:16):
There's so many interesting lessons from this. I wanted to ask how you got your first 10 customers. And what I'm hearing essentially was from this wait list, you launched it on Twitter, people signed up, you picked people to let onboard, you worked with them over the course of a year to make it what they needed, and then eventually you started charging.

Karri Saarinen (01:14:33):
Yeah. I think the first 10 companies using it, I think maybe a little over half. Maybe there was three friends that have startups and they used it. And then I think the majority of them were just from this wait list. But they didn't pay us anything. We didn't have pricing in the beginning or during the private beta. At some point we started building the payments function, so we just added a page in the settings that you can optionally pay.

Karri Saarinen (01:15:00):
The page in the settings that you can optionally pay and then we just give you a slider that's, how much do you want to pay per seat? Then we just see if... I know some people paid $28 per seat and some people pay $1, but it doesn't matter, we just wanted to test the functionality and see what people think. After a year, when we launched, we already had... In the, I don't know, first week of launching, we had probably some hundreds of customers.

Lenny (01:15:34):
I have never heard of the approach to pricing as just an actual sliding scale where people can slide the scale themselves on how much they want to pay. Did that help you figure out what to charge, or is it mostly just an experiment?

Karri Saarinen (01:15:46):
I don't think it gave enough data to decide, but I think it was good to see that there was some people that went... I think that 20 was probably the maximum that people could pay, so I think there was some people that went to it and they felt like, "Actually, yeah, I really love the products. I'm happy to pay $20." I think at least it gave us some confidence that, if we charge for this and it's something under $20, there's going to be market for it.

Lenny (01:16:16):
I want to hear about the story of how you've started to feel product market fit, whatever that means to you. When did you start to feel like, "Wow, this is actually going to work and maybe this is going to be a real business"?

Karri Saarinen (01:16:31):
Yeah, I think we've always been, I don't know, some paranoid or... I guess maybe a paranoid is a good way about the product market fit. I think it's paranoid in a way, we are always wondering, "Do we really have it?" And, "With who do we have it?" I think it's true in our business, that... I think we started feeling it very early on, and when people first started using it and we could see, "Now the whole company is using it and they seem happier using it and the feedback is good and they might have some additional asks for us," but we started feeling like there was definitely a product market fit with certain customer and these were more smaller, early-stage companies maybe where the founder is still running the product and they care about the speed of the shipping or they have certain values in a way, so it was a good fit with them.

(01:17:27):
Then I think we always know that we want to address the whole market and also just these early-stage customers, but we knew that if a Fortune 500 company came to us then, or even today, we might not be... I don't think we can provide them the solution today that works for them, so I don't think the fit is there. For us, the way we think about is, "Do we have the fit in the specific segments?" And how strong that fit is. In the company's journey, the first year, we just focused on, "Can we get the fit..." In the first two years, we focused on, "Can we get the fit in the early stage startup segment?" Basically, the goal was, "We want to be the default for startups, the default tool that the startups pick, and I think we were able to accomplish that, but we just purely focused on that segment and getting the product market fit there.

(01:18:28):
At the same time, we started getting some larger companies and we saw, "Yeah, it's not really great for you right now, but let's work on it, making it better," so I think the last two years we've been focusing on that. It's like, "How do we make the software work better? How do we get the product market fit stronger in this larger company segments that are hundreds of people or 1000 people?"

Lenny (01:18:53):
I think this is such a good way and smart way of thinking about product market fit. A lot of people see product market fit as this binary, "I have it or I don't," and, "When am I going to really feel product market fit?" What you're describing is what I often hear, it's more of this spectrum of more and more confidence that there's product market fit and, even more specifically, it's product market fit with segments of the market. It's this map of the world and you're just slowly acquiring territory in the market with specific elements and then, over time, it grows and grows.

Karri Saarinen (01:19:23):
Yeah, I think a spectrum is a good way to think about it, too. I feel like there's this blog post written in the past where you know when you have product market fit and I think it probably... It's like that for some, I don't know, social consumer apps. If it's taking off or not, then you don't really have a lot of different segments, or you don't really think about it, you have millions of users and then you see it's taking off, so you have a product market fit. I think in more like a B2B world. I think there's always... You can have different sizes of customers, you can have different domains the customers are in, or there's different categories where you might be doing really well in one category and then not that well another.

(01:20:14):
I think maybe the countering to do things is that, actually, if you're doing really well in some category, just double down on that. This is something I talked to the Zoom founder, Eric, at some point in the company's lifecycle, and this is also what he said. When they were building Zoom in the early days, they would get this one type of customer. I don't know, maybe it's a university and then it worked really well for them. Then they're like, "How do we get more of the universities?" They would always focus on a certain customer rather than, "Let's just try to get everyone, so let's focus on everything," which is not possible. Again, it's about the focus. If you see that something is working really well, then it's almost like you should focus on doing that more until you hit some point. It's like, "Okay, now we do have that category captured or handled as much as we want," and we should expand to new area.

Lenny (01:21:12):
Essentially, look for pull and just follow that and pay attention to that.

Karri Saarinen (01:21:17):
Yeah. I think, for us, there can be sometimes... For example, now we have... Most of the AI companies are using us, so I think it's always... Before that, it was a crypto company, so I think there's... When we see these kinds of things happening, then we start to think like, "Could we do something differently or could we get more of these AI companies on board?"

Lenny (01:21:42):
Such a great lesson. Just a few more questions, you mentioned that you launched on Twitter and that led to a large wait list and a growing wait list. Is there anything you did before that to build this following? That sounds really amazing, "Cool, we just announced it on Twitter and we have this large wait list and then we grow and we get all these customers." Is there anything you did ahead of time in anticipation of this launch? Would you recommend people work on building some kind of following online before they work in a startup? Was it just like, "Hey, we happen to have this following," and it worked out? Anything along those lines you would recommend to founders these days?

Karri Saarinen (01:22:16):
Yeah. I think definitely if you have a following and, obviously, depends on what kind of following, but I think my background as a designer, I would say at Airbnb and Coinbase and other places, and I did some talks in conferences and write some blog posts. I was definitely out there and had some of that following, which was helpful, but it wasn't like I have hundreds of thousands of followers or millions, or something. I had maybe 10,000 or something, which is a significant number, but then I think the other thing is... I think with the announcement, one of the things we did, I think, well is I think sometimes startups do try to emulate successful, large companies too much and you do this fancy announcements where it's like, "Hey, now we are doing this fancy thing and it sounds very corporate or something."

(01:23:17):
With our announcement, we wrote it more direct or authentic to us like, "This is what we're going to do and this is why, and these are some of the things we're going to do." On a Twitter, we did the same thing. All of us founders, we wrote our own reasons why we're doing this, and I think it was just much more... I think people like us could resonate more with it, so we were writing to the right audience. I think that's probably the first thing when you're announcing your company, you think about, "Who is my first audience? Who would be the best early users for this product and where are they?" And then, "How do they think about things and what kind of language do they use?" For us, it came very naturally, because we are these people.

(01:24:09):
We are in building software and these companies, and other people have seen similar things we have seen, so I think the way we announced it resonated with a lot of people. Then I think we did have some friends... I said we got some angel round where we got some friends involved. The main reason we did it was that we just felt like, in the early days, it's good to have... You feel like a real company in a way, that you have someone to answer for in a way. Even though the investors normally run your company or they don't have that much power, it's more like, "I took someone's money so I now need to make it worth it," kind of. With the announcement, again, we could use some of those people to spread the message as well.

Lenny (01:24:57):
To close out our conversation, just a couple more broad questions. You have a pretty unique culture at Linear, and I know one fun thing that you do is you have this baking competition. Can you talk about that and what it is you do there?

Karri Saarinen (01:25:12):
Yeah. Since we are a fully remote and distributed company, so we have people in Europe and US, a lot of group gatherings are challenging. Remote group sessions are challenging, because the time zones are so different, so some of the basic things, like happy hours, don't really work that well. Also, Zoom happy hours is probably not that fun anyway. I think a lot of people in the company watch The Great British Baking Show, so we decided, "Maybe we do something like that," where basically, we would just pick a recipe. Firstly, it was baking, now we expanded to cooking recipes, too. We just pick a recipe that is somewhat reasonable to do in a few hours, in a couple of hours, and it doesn't require tons of equipment or skill, or something. Then we just tell people, "Go buy the ingredients, use the company card," everyone has a company card, "And then hop on Zoom on this day."

(01:26:18):
For me, since I'm in California, it's like 8:00 AM, so we started the baking or cooking then. We've made things like roll cake and lemon meringue pie, and we made some [Portuguese 01:26:35], which is Portuguese pastry. Then we just hop on the Zoom, everyone's doing their thing, following the recipe, and then sometimes people have questions like, "Hey," I don't know, "I'm stuck with this," or, "My dough looks weird, does your dough look like this?" People can help each other and then also chitchat about whatever random things at the same time. Then we do the thing and then everyone takes pictures and posts on the Slack channel, it's what they achieved. I think we have friendly competitions like who did it best, so people sometimes put a lot of effort into the decorations and visuals.

(01:27:17):
In a way, it's, again, a craft thing that we do. I think baking and cooking and these kinds of things are also a craft, so we liked it that way. Yeah, we've been basically doing it quarterly since the beginning of the company. Yeah, the latest thing, we were a little bit... I think didn't have that much time, because we decided to do an easier thing, which is a summer drink recipe, so I think people made matcha drinks and some coconut drinks or white iced tea, or something. Yeah, that was interesting to do.

Lenny (01:27:55):
Have you ever won one of these competitions yourself?

Karri Saarinen (01:27:59):
I don't know if we declare winners that much, but I do think I do... Since I'm a designer, I do have some advantages on the visual presentation, so I think that I generally do well on that. Obviously, with this remote competition, that's the only thing you can really look for. It's not necessarily about the taste or the texture, because you can't really taste it through the Zoom.

Lenny (01:28:27):
Maybe as a last question, just again broadly, you've gone from being an IC designer, manager of designers, to the CEO of very fast-growing company. What's something that you've learned about leadership over the journey of Linear that maybe you didn't expect?

Karri Saarinen (01:28:43):
For some reason, it was surprising to me, I think, that being a CEO or some of these leadership roles is that you end up doing so many different things. When I was a designer, even if I would be some high-level designer in some company, you're just mostly focusing on the design and that's your job, but then when you're a CEO, then every week or every day, there's some different thing going on. Sometimes there can be problems, but a lot of times, it's like, "Hey, we need to figure out how we're going to do this. How are we going to do this compensation?" Or, "How are we going to do this marketing plan?" Or, "How are we going to do this offsite thing?" What's definitely challenging for me is handling that different kinds of things that come to you and staying somewhat focused, still, on something.

(01:29:42):
I think I haven't necessarily fully figured it out, but I also figured it out, that hiring and delegation helps with this, that if you can find other leaders that can take on certain areas, that's helpful. That's the main thing, that it's a very wide range of things that you maybe didn't have experience before, but also, I think it's interesting for me to learn about these things. You learn about the financials and you learn about legal things, and then you start to feel like, "Actually, I know something about this thing," over time.

Lenny (01:30:18):
For the actual final question, before we get to very exciting lightning round, what's just the future of Linear? What's coming? What's happening in the future? Anything you can share?

Karri Saarinen (01:30:27):
Yeah, I think there's always things we're working on and improving. One, a newer thing we're working on is this feature called Asks. Basically, what it is is that... We see that, in a company, there can be a lot of different people that need to interact with the product team or different people that need to interact with this team, but they're not necessarily in Linear or part of this team. We'd be building this an Ask feature, which is an integration to Slack where you can very easily go to a Slack channel and then ask your question. You need something from this team, maybe it's the IT team, that you need a laptop, or maybe it's the infrastructure team and you need something from them, then the team that is handling the request, they can very easily send it to Linear, into this triage that we have, and then they can start doing stuff with it.

(01:31:26):
If they have questions or additional questions to the actual person who requested it, we can send those messages back to the person through Slack, so they don't actually have to go to Linear or they don't have to be a Linear user to use it. We think this is just a good way for the company, or the whole company, to be more potentially involved in the product operations without having to be a power user of Linear, because not every function really uses it or needs to use it.

Lenny (01:32:01):
Awesome. What a cool peek at something coming out soon, or maybe out by the time this comes out. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a bunch of questions for you. Are you ready?

Karri Saarinen (01:32:13):
Yeah, I'm ready.

Lenny (01:32:14):
All right. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Karri Saarinen (01:32:20):
Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander. He wasn't really an architect, but he, I think, taught in Berkeley. He has these interesting thoughts about building things and he focuses on buildings and towns and these kinds of spaces, but I think there's a lot of things that are also interesting for building software. The other book that I like is the Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, because it also talks about the quality of things and I think that's one of the main themes of the book. The thing is also that quality is so hard to define. If you actually start thinking about it, it's like, how do you define it? It's really hard to pin down, but it's like when you try something or see it, then you know if it's quality or not.

Lenny (01:33:13):
What are some recent movies or TV shows you've really enjoyed?

Karri Saarinen (01:33:17):
I think that the movie is probably John Wick 4. Obviously, there's no story in that movie, but I think it's very true to its nature, so I like that fact. Also, recently, I started watching the Silo on Apple TV, and I think I like it. It's like a good mystery and then, also, it reminds me of the Fallout games, so I like it that way, too.

Lenny (01:33:46):
I actually read the Silo books and I was really excited for the show to come out, but I mentioned this on a previous podcast, the show is so little to do with actual books. The core ideas are the same, but there's all these stories that they're just making up on the show, so I stopped watching, because that's not what I was hoping for, but-

Karri Saarinen (01:34:02):
Okay, interesting. Maybe I need to check the books later, once I watch the show.

Lenny (01:34:08):
Yeah. Definitely, read the books, but there's three of them and only the first one is actually good. The other ones are not actually very good and I should not have read them, because it just went off the rails a little bit. Anyway, next question. What is a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?

Karri Saarinen (01:34:22):
I think, usually, I like to ask, what is the candidate most proud of and why? On their professional life or otherwise, what they're most proud of and why. Then I think we can go deeper on that, but I think it gives you a little bit of indication, what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well and we can spend time on it versus just asking something more like negative things.

Lenny (01:34:52):
What are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you really, really like?

Karri Saarinen (01:34:58):
I'm not sure if I discovered them recently, but recently in this home office, I've been installing some of these hue lights and I really like them, because throughout the day, I can have more harsh lighting, because I'm in meetings or something, and then in the evening, I can change the temperature. I make it much more red or orange, or something. I think it's nice that you can transition the space. It's like, "Okay, now I'm working and now I'm doing something else." You can use the lights to indicate that.

Lenny (01:35:31):
That is so cool. Do you automate the schedule or you manually change the color?

Karri Saarinen (01:35:35):
Yeah, I just manually change it. On my home app, I have scenes that... There's the night scene and then there's the day scene, or the morning scene, so I just click that button and then it changes the lights.

Lenny (01:35:50):
That is extremely cool, I'm going to try that myself. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat yourself or share with people? Something you come back to a lot.

Karri Saarinen (01:36:02):
Go slow to go fast. I think, for me, it's about that. Sometimes people have a tendency to rushing into things and especially, I think, in startups, but other places too, you have this like... I think urgency is important, but then sometimes you have too much urgency and you are rushing things, and what happens is that you rushed it and now you need to come back to fix it. I think sometimes I like to think that you should take some time to actually think about it and, "What are you going to do?" And then do it. In the end, it's going to be faster that way than going back and forth and fixing things.

Lenny (01:36:42):
What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught you?

Karri Saarinen (01:36:45):
I think it's respecting people and things. I think the people respect is pretty obvious, but I think with the things you have, also, I think you should take good care of them when you use them. I don't know, clean them or put them away, and then they're ready for the next time. I think I like that, though. Rather than you treating things like they're trash or not that valuable, you should treat things that they are valuable.

Lenny (01:37:16):
Final question. You were born in Finland, I think you grew up in Finland. What is a Finnish food that people should definitely try to get as soon as they can?

Karri Saarinen (01:37:25):
One is this salmon soup, and it might sound weird, a fish soup, maybe it's not going to be that interesting. It's a creamy soup, it's on potatoes, carrots, and other things, and it's almost like a little bit of sweet flavor to it. You can make it yourself at home or you can... If you go to Finland, there's probably always a few restaurants that offer it.

Lenny (01:37:52):
Okay, amazing. Is that something we could get here or you have to go to Finland to get it?

Karri Saarinen (01:37:56):
I don't think I've ever seen it here in the US in any restaurant, but it's not very hard to make it yourself. You can probably Google a recipe. Basically, you just need some salmon, some basic spices and some cream and some fruit, vegetables.

Lenny (01:38:13):
All right. Next episode, we're going to do a cooking show with Karri. Karri, thank you so much for being here. You're building a very special company in a really unique way, and I think many founders and many product builders can learn a ton from watching you operate in the business that you're building. Again, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe ask you some more questions, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Karri Saarinen (01:38:38):
Yeah. I'm on Twitter, my name, Karri Saarinen. We also have the Linear account, which I think is interesting. That's just @Linear. I hope everyone can check out Linear and see if it could work for them in their company, and figure out if there's a pilot. I think we are always happy to assist on those things, if you just want to try it out and try it with the team, we can help you to set it up and help you to understand how to use the product.

Lenny (01:39:09):
Awesome. It's just Linear, the app, right? Is that the URL?

Karri Saarinen (01:39:13):
Yes.

Lenny (01:39:14):
Awesome. Okay, easy-peasy. Amazing. Karri, again, thank you so much for being here. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

# An inside look at X’s Community Notes | Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
The work that you guys do has had such a tremendous impact on the way the world works. I want to start with just giving people a brief understanding of what is Community Notes.

Keith Coleman (00:00:09):
Someone on X can see a post. If they think it's misleading, they can propose a note that they think other people might find informative. Other people can then rate that note.

Jay Baxter (00:00:18):
We actually look for agreement from people who have disagreed in the past. And what we see is when people actually have that sort of surprising agreement, that's what makes the notes so neutral and accurate and well- written, really, overall.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
There's many people that are very polarized. How do you deal with people that are super anti-vax, super Jan 6?

Keith Coleman (00:00:36):
One philosophical thing that's important is that we want all of humanity to participate and sometimes people are surprised by that. We have all of humanity. We then have the data to understand what notes will be helpful to actual humanity. Every post is eligible for notes. We shouldn't exempt Elon. We shouldn't exempt government figures. We should be like everyone... Even advertisers can get notes.

Jay Baxter (00:00:58):
There have been external studies run by people totally independent of us who have found that if you take a post with or without a Community Note, that actually people's agreement with the core claims in the post does change if they see it with a note versus without.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):
Is there anything else along the lines of just working for Elon within an org Elon runs that might surprise people?

Keith Coleman (00:01:18):
If I were to start a company in that company, it would be even leaner than I would've made it before. I've been amazed with just how much the team is able to accomplish with a small group and I think because of a small group-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guests are Keith Coleman, Product Lead for Community Notes, and Jay Baxter, Founding ML Engineer and Researcher for Community Notes. This conversation may be my newest favorite podcast episode so far. Community Notes is one of the most impactful and clever and, also, underappreciated products in the world right now.

(00:01:52):
If you ever use X/Twitter and you see a note underneath a tweet correcting the misinformation in that tweet, that is Community Notes. I've never heard a deep dive into the story behind the product and the team that built it and I'm excited to bring you just that. We get into the surprising origin story of the product, how the algorithm actually works, how the algorithm emerged out of an internal contest within Twitter, the principles behind Community Notes, and why staying true to them has been so key to its success. Also, how it survived four different leaders, including Elon and Jack, and why it's now a big part of the solution to solving misinformation on the internet. Including recently being adopted by Meta as their main fact-checking tool. This is an incredibly special episode and I'm so excited to bring it to you.

Keith and Jay, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Keith Coleman (00:05:23):
It's great to be here. [inaudible 00:05:25].

Jay Baxter (00:05:25):
Thanks for having us on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):
It's so my pleasure. I'm so thrilled to be having this conversation. The work that you guys do has had such a tremendous impact on the way the world works. So many product teams are always talking about driving impact and want to drive impact. You guys have actually built things that have changed the world in meaningful ways and continue to do that. And I've never really heard the backstory of how Community Notes came to be and how it works and all these things, so I'm really appreciative of you guys making time to chat.

Keith Coleman (00:05:52):
Yeah. First, thanks for saying that. That's why we built this thing is to help people and it's great to hear it. It's great to see people enjoying it and finding it useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:02):
I want to start with just giving people a brief understanding of what is Community Notes. I think a lot of people kind of heard about it, kind of maybe see it on X. As they scroll through, they see these notes but they're like, "I don't actually know what this is." So can you just briefly describe what is Community Notes?

Keith Coleman (00:06:18):
Community Notes is a way for the people, like the public, to add context to posts that might be misleading. The basic way it works is that someone on X can see a post. If they think it's misleading, they can propose a note that they think other people might find informative. Other people can then rate that note. And if the note is found helpful by people who normally disagree with each other, indicating that it's probably accurate, it's probably really neutrally-worded, it's probably informative, then it will show to everyone on X. The goal is just to get people more information about what they're seeing so they can make better decisions in their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:57):
Amazing, and I think hearing this, it's absurd that this works. I think when people originally heard this idea like, "No way this is going to work." And so, just to dive a little bit deeper, can you give us a deeper understanding of how it actually works? Because I think it's the algorithm that you guys designed that is so clever that allowed this to work. So talk a little bit about that algorithm.

Jay Baxter (00:07:22):
Yeah. So I think a key misunderstanding a lot of people have if they haven't really dived into details, they just think that maybe someone can write a note and it appears immediately or we're just taking a majority rules vote of who thinks the note's good. I think both of those approaches would probably lead to biased or inaccurate notes. I think the key thing, really, that we do is we actually look for agreement from people who have disagreed in the past.

(00:07:48):
And what we see is when people actually have that sort of surprising agreement, that's what makes the notes so neutral and accurate and well-written, really, overall. It's just that people who are very polarized, overall, often can't find agreement when things aren't accurate, right? I think it also provides some good anti-manipulation properties. I think people are often... If you said... I think back in 2020 before we started building anything here, whether this could work at all, I think a room of ML engineers would say, "Oh, you have to keep it closed source. People are going to be manipulating this all the time. You have to use ground truth labels from fact checkers. There's no way that you could bootstrap the system without external labels." But it turns out that you can do that with this kind of bridging-based agreement algorithm is what we call it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:41):
Okay. So just to summarize and make it super clear. It's basically people... Someone writes a note. This information is fault... What's a good example, just as we talk about this, like a classic example?

Keith Coleman (00:08:50):
A really classic example is an AI generated image or an out of context image like, "Look what's happening here." But it's actually from five years ago in a different country and a different topic or something-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:00):
Oh, man. I've seen this so many times where it's like, "Look what's happening in San Francisco," and I'm like, "No, this is a whole different city and that's not-"

Keith Coleman (00:09:06):
Totally. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):
Yeah. Okay. So someone posts this AI image. Someone writes a note, "This is actually five years ago in a different city," and this algorithm helps understand if this note is true and it's just regular people doing this.

Jay Baxter (00:09:23):
Yep. Regular people who have signed up to be Community Notes contributors. So there are a few checks, like you do have to have a verified phone number for instance. But yeah, at the end of the day, these are regular people. Not necessarily professional fact checkers or anything like that.

Keith Coleman (00:09:40):
And yeah, that was really important to us too. There was a question at the beginning, to the point Jay was making of like, "Did anyone think this was going to work?" Obviously, it was a crazy idea. We didn't know if regular people were going to be able to do this task and certainly people had concerns about whether they would do it effectively.

(00:09:58):
Initially, some people inside the company were suggesting like, "Hey, why don't you have journalists or some select group be the first participants?" But very specifically we were like, "No. We're trying to move away from the idea of curated editorial decisions being made around this. This is supposed to be open to everyone." So we very intentionally try to allow all humans in. People are randomly selected and that's important to it feeling fair, feeling open, feeling trustable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:27):
Yeah. And again, it's just like this sounds like the holy grail of understanding what is true and it actually works. And works so well that Meta recently, as you all know, decided to adopt this exact system for them instead of having tens of thousands of fact checkers reviewing things.

Jay Baxter (00:10:46):
One distinction that I would make, which maybe can come off as nitpicky but I think is important, is Community Notes adds additional context. It's not fact-checking necessarily, right? So there are cases where the post could be true. But maybe, it's just misleading because there there's no context or there's missing context. We cover those cases and I think that's an important distinction. We just have the philosophy that users should be able to make up their own minds, right? Like, "Here's extra context, take it or leave it," right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):
Yeah. What I think about, you shared this with me, this example of a picture with a cat and somebody's Community Note was just, "That's a dog." Or is it the other way around or that's a-

Jay Baxter (00:11:31):
Yeah. "A Palestinian boy shares his bread with a dog," was the post and it's a picture of this cat. So obviously, this particular note is not super necessary because it just says, "That's a cat," and links to a Wikipedia for cat. It's a good example that the system is... This is not something a professional fact-checker or whatever or you think would need fact-checking. But it's proof that the system is really run by the users at the end of the day and adds some comic relief, I guess. And the note is correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:06):
Okay. It's important.

Jay Baxter (00:12:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:08):
When does a post get triggered to even be considered for Community Note? Is there a threshold or is it just you can write a Community Note on anything and people decide what they would vote on? How does that work?

Keith Coleman (00:12:19):
So every post is eligible for notes and that was, again, another really important principle. It's like, "We shouldn't exempt Elon. We shouldn't exempt government figures. We should..." Everyone, even advertisers, can get notes. So any posts on the platform can get a note. And if you look in practice, you'll see notes appearing on world leaders, on Elon, on ads, on media organizations, and on, obviously, just regular people using social media. But yeah, the idea is really that it's an even playing field. For a note to be proposed, the person proposing it has to have earned the ability to write notes. So there is that aspect where you have to earn in to be able to do this. And the way you earn that ability is through your ratings by demonstrating the ability to help identify notes that are found helpful to a broad range of people. So basically, if you have an ability to see and know, recognize what's helpful with a lot of people, then you have the ability to start proposing notes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):
I actually signed up to be on... What do you call these people? Note take-

Jay Baxter (00:13:24):
Contributors.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:25):
Okay. Contributors. Yeah. So I've been rating. I haven't achieved-

Keith Coleman (00:13:29):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
I can't write notes yet.

Keith Coleman (00:13:30):
Yeah. It's not super easy. It takes some effort.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:33):
Are there stats you can share about the scale of Community Notes at this point, especially things that might surprise people?

Keith Coleman (00:13:39):
Yeah. I mean, the service is growing rapidly, so there are hundreds of notes per day. And to put that into context, I saw some stats recently from someone at UC Berkeley saying there was something like 10 traditional fact checks a day. So in contrast, there's hundreds of notes a day that are getting shown. They span a huge range of topics from, obviously, politics, news, out to entertainment, sports, gaming. Just whatever is going on that day.

(00:14:07):
In addition to there being hundreds of these individual notes, they can also be matched to multiple posts. So if someone writes a note on an image or a video, like let's say it's AI generated or something like that, that note will automatically be matched to all posts that contain the same image. So you can have a single note matching to thousands of posts. And over let's say the last year, 2024, we had something like 95,000 notes that were seen about 30 billion times. That's more than double the prior year. Prior year was something like 37K notes seen 14 billion times. So that rate is increasing dramatically when you think about 30 billion views, that's a lot of information that is getting out there that might not have been out there otherwise, which is pretty cool. And part of the reason it is expanding like that is the contributor base is expanding. There's something like 950,000 contributors around the world. That's nearing a million people making this happen which is amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:13):
Wow. And I'm one of those, right? I count as a contributor?

Keith Coleman (00:15:15):
Yeah. Yep. No. If you're signed up as a contributor, you count.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:16):
Okay. Cool.

Jay Baxter (00:15:18):
Then, there's more people on the waitlist too. So there's plenty of headroom for more growth. Regarding the matching on media and URLs, I think that's a huge way to get extra coverage. Also, I do think we've been very careful to make sure that those matches are precise. Because I think one thing that people love about Community Notes compared to other types of fact checking is that, actually, the notes are custom written for the particular claim you're seeing, right? So often, a fact check warning would just say something like, "Get the facts here." And then, there's a link to some generic page about voting information, which is so not helpful to have the information behind a click. So pulling the context up so that you have zero clicks that you need to make and keeping it specific is so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):
One feature I love that I imagine you guys thought deeply about is if I liked the post in the past, I get notified later if a community note shows up, so that I'm not remembering this false information.

Keith Coleman (00:16:22):
Yeah. I mean, we try to make notes as fast as we can, so we want them to appear instantly if possible. But inevitably, there's going to be a time gap between when a post goes live and when people figure out what's going on and when they get the note out there. And so, we send those notifications to try to close that gap. And yeah, we get a lot of love for that. We see people take screenshots and share them. They're excited about it. And it's also a pretty cool example of something you can do on the internet, in the social media world that was difficult in a print or standard news world where you would see maybe a correction the next day in a corner of a paper that was hard to read. Here, you're getting a ping about it if you've engaged with a post and note shows up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:05):
One user feedback point is I'd love the push to just tell me, "Here's what you got wrong." Because I find that I actually have to go into it and read it and I feel like the push could just be like, "Here's more context to this thing." You're like-

Jay Baxter (00:17:20):
Agreed.

Keith Coleman (00:17:20):
We'll go take a look at that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:21):
There we go. Live user feedback.

Keith Coleman (00:17:24):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:25):
Okay. I want to get into the origin story of this whole thing. But two more questions, because we're on this thread. One is what's the the threshold for a note to show up on a note? Is that information you can share, just how does that work?

Jay Baxter (00:17:35):
So just because of the details of the way the algorithm works, it uses this machine learning algorithm called Matrix factorization where we fit it with Gradient Descent and whatnot. The threshold is it's 0.4 on this made up scale-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:52):
0.4. Great.

Jay Baxter (00:17:53):
Yeah. I mean, in practice, what it means is basically a majority of people... If there is a polarized divide relevant to the notes. Obviously, some notes are not about politics or something polarizing. But if there is, then a sizable majority of people on both sides would generally need to find the note helpful. And then, there are other rules that come into play beyond that main one. So even if it's above that threshold, it might get filtered out if... There's a separate algorithm that's looking at agreement between people's incorrect tags. So like maybe people found the note helpful but incorrect, right? It happens. And in those cases, it doesn't matter if it's above the helpfulness threshold.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:39):
This is probably the wrong way to think about it, but is it 40% of people that normally disagree, agree-

Jay Baxter (00:18:45):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
Okay. It's-

Jay Baxter (00:18:45):
It means nothing like that. It's just like on some arbitrary scale-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:48):
Okay.

Jay Baxter (00:18:48):
Yeah.

Keith Coleman (00:18:49):
Yeah. If we change random other things about the algorithm, that number would also have to change to an equally seemingly arbitrary number. We arrived at some numbers like that by gauging user feedback. So we could share a lot of notes with people, get feedback on which ones are helpful, and just a line emerged about indicating where things go from questionable to pretty clearly helpful.

Jay Baxter (00:19:13):
Yeah. And it is set right now, by the way, to be really conservative, I think. We just are pretty particular about quality and we really want note quality to be really high. I think Keith and I both believe that we live or die based on the quality of the notes at the end of the day. So we'd rather not show a note that maybe good, but we didn't have enough signal on than the other way around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
That makes so much sense. I've never seen a Community Note that is wrong and breaking that promise is a big deal. So I completely get why you guys are super conservative there. Okay. Two more questions [inaudible 00:19:53] because I'm just curious. These weren't on my list of questions to ask, but I feel like people wonder this. How many notes are written versus end up showing up and triggering on a-

Keith Coleman (00:20:02):
We probably show about 8% of notes that get proposed. It's been between, let's say, 7% and 10% or 11%, something like that over time. The number can vary a little bit. And as Jay said, there are undoubtedly... And you can see it, there's clearly more good notes than we show, but the goal is to hold a really high bar. We want to show a note when it's going to be helpful, when it's not going to appear biased and undermine trust in the system. We want these to be neutral, informative, helpful. And as Jay was saying, we view the worst possible mistake as showing a bad note because that's going to undermine trust and the trust is why people like the product.

(00:20:47):
So yeah, the bar is there. And like I said, there's clearly some in that remaining, let's call it 90%, that are good. And then, there's a lot that are just not that great and there's some that are bad. And if you write one of these ones that are bad which bad being defined as people who normally disagree find the note not helpful, so it's like the inverse of the ones we show. If you write one that people normally disagree, find not helpful, you actually will ultimately lose your ability to write and have to earn it back. That other 90% is a mix. Sometimes people look at the number, they're like, "Oh, why don't you show more?" It's like, "Well, you probably actually don't really want us showing most of those." The gold here is that the system is able to filter out the good ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
That makes sense. Okay. One other question is there's many people that are very polarized, like very disagreeable with a lot of things. How do they filter into this algorithm? How do you deal with people that are super anti-vax, super Jan 6, like all these very extreme potential views?

Jay Baxter (00:21:47):
If people really are so polarized that there isn't agreement among people that typically disagree, it's possible that this is one of those notes that might be correct, but it wouldn't be helpful to show as context. Maybe it's about a claim that people have really entrenched opinions about and they've read hundreds of things about it already.

(00:22:15):
Probably this is just not going to improve people's understanding. It's just not going to be a helpful user experience. So it might not be the worst thing in those cases to not show the note. People, a few years ago, were pretty pessimistic that maybe fact-checking never changes people's understandings about what's true. Actually, there have been external studies run by people totally independent of us who have found that if you take a community note or posts with or without a community note... That actually, people's agreement with the core claims in the post does change if they see it with the note versus without. So we are having an impact on this thing that people previously thought was maybe not so easy to do.

(00:22:59):
And so, it's nice to focus on the cases where there is the bridging agreement. I would also say there is this reputation component to the algorithm as well. So if you consistently rate notes in a way that is counter to the bridging-based consensus, then we will stop counting your ratings. So if you're the kind of person who constantly rates bad notes as helpful, we do filter you out. So there's a difference between those types of people versus the good but polarized ones.

Keith Coleman (00:23:30):
Yeah. I think one philosophical thing that's important is that we want all of humanity to participate. And sometimes, people are surprised by that. They'll be like, "Oh, aren't there people who shouldn't be doing this?", or like, "Their thinking is so extreme or something, maybe they shouldn't participate." But our view is it's actually we want to have all of humanity here. Because if we have all of humanity, we then have the data to understand what notes will be helpful to actual humanity. We can better model that better or better understand and better show those notes.

(00:24:03):
So it's advantageous to have people who have all sorts of points of views and we don't expect that every note will be loved by every single person. That's an impossible bar. But we do intend to show the notes that 80% of people are going to read and say, "Wow. I'm glad I knew that." And so, in that sense, it doesn't matter how maybe extreme someone views a person's views as. It's still great to have them in the program. So no matter what your views are, please sign up and participate. It helps identify what's really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
Cool. And we'll link to people if they want to actually sign up, so they know how to do this. Something we didn't actually specify, these are all volunteers. No one's getting paid to be doing these notes and voting, right?

Keith Coleman (00:24:49):
Yeah. It's totally based on intrinsic motivation and we think that's a great reason to be doing it. When you talk to the most active contributors, a lot of them, they want to have better information out in the world and that's a great motivation. So yeah, that's why they... If you think about, like for these people, the impact they can have is nuts. So when we first launched US-wide, this was like in 2022, a note appeared on a White House tweet and the White House deleted the tweet and reissued an updated statement.

(00:25:25):
Imagine being the person who wrote that. You probably have 12 followers. Your posts probably get a couple likes. And here, you just put a note on the White House and they changed their public talking points based on what you did. That is an incredible amount of impact. So you could see why people are motivated to do it when they care about what's going on in the world. You don't have to be a big, well-known person to shape the discourse and information flow in a way that's helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
It's insane. There's so much to love about this. One is just the meritocracy of this whole operation of just anybody that is true and correct can participate and have impact. Also, it just shows you how much information we get that is just wrong. We had no idea how often we see things that are wrong and now we do.

Keith Coleman (00:26:18):
Working on this product has made me realize just how many things I used to trust by default, that now I look at more skeptically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:26):
Definitely mean these days. Okay. Before we get to the origin story, is there anything else along those lines you guys think might be really important to share, that are really interesting?

Jay Baxter (00:26:36):
Sure. I guess one other thing is that although we don't actually use the fact that a post was noted in the core ranking algorithm, which we think is a nice property. There is a really big impact just organically, meaning not from the algorithm but just from user behavior, where people will like and re-share or quote posts way less when-

Jay Baxter (00:27:00):
Quote. Posts way less when notes are applied. I don't know, for people out there who typically run A-B tests on big platforms, you may already be familiar with this, but 1% is typically an awesome effect size for any algorithm change. We saw more like 30 to 40% engagement rate drops for likes and reposts in A-B tests we were ran when showing a post with or without a note, which is just crazy big. That's just an A-B test on the engagement rate, so that's not the network effect. If you capture the overall network effect of how post spread less by that person's repost, basically if you look top line with a difference in differences approach, multiple different external research groups have both found consistently that there's a 50 or 60% drop in total reposts, which is just nuts after a note is applied. It's having a really big impact on spread actually, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):
That's so great to hear. It's what I would want to see and it's incredible impact. Basically, an AI image of something false would just go crazy on Twitter, and did before Community Notes came out, and now what you're saying is just adding that context, not actually... Like you're saying, the algorithm doesn't demote it. If there's something incorrect, it's just people are like, "Okay, this is false, why would I want to retweet this?" That makes sense.

Keith Coleman (00:28:28):
Correct.

Jay Baxter (00:28:29):
Right.

Keith Coleman (00:28:29):
Yeah, the notes just totally take the wind out these stories. The thing will be going viral, note appears, resharing drops 50 to 60%, and that's it. At 50 to 60% per generation, the virality quickly goes to zero.

Jay Baxter (00:28:45):
By the way, I have very mixed feelings about this next one, but authors become 80% more likely to decrease, sorry, to delete their post after they get noted, which okay, that's great, because less misinfo out there, but I'm pan about, because those are usually the best notes. If the note was so just good that you had no other option but to delete your post, those notes don't get seen by other people, right? Because-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:13):
That's hard.

Jay Baxter (00:29:14):
There's an argument, by the way, that seeing... Just because you might see the same misleading claim elsewhere off X, or somewhere else on X, it might be good to actually show... Better to have seen the post with the note than not see it at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:28):
Yeah.

Jay Baxter (00:29:29):
Unsure about that claim.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
That is so interesting.

Jay Baxter (00:29:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):
Yeah, I'd be so sad if I was that community note writer and just... Man, it's so good. They just can't even keep the post up. Okay. Coming back from today's world, where this small amount of code is changing the way people understand the world and what they believe, and making the White House rescind their announcements, zooming back to the beginning of how this whole project started, what I heard just briefly is, Keith, you were just tired of managing PMs, you wanted to just work on something yourself, you wanted to work on something impactful away from corporate BS, and you basically just started looking for something that was impactful, important, and you found this. Talk about just how it all came to be at the beginnings of the story.

Keith Coleman (00:30:19):
Yeah. I mean, for me, the beginnings actually go back to why I joined, it was then, Twitter in 2016. I had a startup and we'd had some acquisition offers, and one of them was from this company, Twitter. It was 2016, it was the middle of the election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and there were something like three televised debates, but every day, there was a debate happening on Twitter, and it was very clear, this is where people are talking about these things that matter, where information is being shared, where ideas are being formed. As a user, it was obvious that I could get good information there, but it was also obvious that there was questionable information floating around. I remember just looking, as an outsider, thinking like, "Wow, this is a really hard problem and it also seems really important," so we ended up going to Twitter and the company was in a turnaround at that point.

(00:31:21):
My first three years was just helping to get the company growing again, working on everything that was the consumer product, getting user growth going back and people wanting to work there again, et cetera, but a few years in, I was reflecting on what we had done. I think we had done a lot of good work getting momentum going, and people in the us and in the industry had tried things to deal with misleading information, but nothing was really working. It was obvious nothing was working. Nothing could handle the scale of the problem, nothing could handle the speed, and a lot of people just didn't trust the existing approaches. The existing approaches were either fact-checkers or internal trust and safety teams making decisions about what was or was not misleading. A lot of people just didn't want or trust that to be the way this was decided, which is very reasonable.

(00:32:19):
I'm looking at that, I was still managing a large PM team. That's a whole story in itself. That job required a lot of energy in, and I didn't feel like I always saw the output that I wanted to see from it. I didn't see the change in the product I wanted to see and I was contemplating, "Should I go start a company? Should I do something else?" And I kept coming back to this problem. I'm like, "Man, how is the world going to deal with this information quality issue of what we get on social media?" Wherever get it. I'm at this company where you can make a difference on this problem, why not go and try some crazy ideas and see if one of them might work? I had a kid, I came back from paternity leave, I went to my boss, Kayvon. I was like, "Hey, Kayvon. How about I just stop doing my job and I go work on this instead? 'This' being trying some crazy ideas to see if we can deal with misleading info."

(00:33:24):
He was stoked, so I went off and started working on that. It started with just reading any research I could on the problem and existing solutions. What was or was not working, what were the issues, and then into prototyping. Then it ultimately led to us building and piloting this idea that became Community Notes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
Amazing. I have so many questions and we're going to keep going through the story, but when you joined Twitter, what was the... It was called Twitter. At this point, I'm going to try to call it X now, which I know is important to your boss. What era of Twitter was it at that point? It was Kayvon joined and who was the CEO? Because there's been many.

Keith Coleman (00:34:05):
Okay, yeah. I came in December 2016, so Jack had relatively recently come back as CEO to turn the company around, and just to give you a sense of the state of the company, something like a third of employees were leaving every year. Just imagine a third of your team gone every year. The stock was in the toilet, the product was not really growing, so Jack was working on a turnaround and Kayvon was there already. Kayvon was running Periscope with a bunch of video stuff, and that group continued to... Jack was there up through the start of the Community Notes, then Birdwatch Project, and... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:50):
Okay, and it was called Birdwatch. I don't think we've used that term yet, but that's an important point. It was called Birdwatch initially.

Keith Coleman (00:34:55):
Yeah. It was originally called Birdwatch when we started the project, but obviously, somewhat famously the name changed along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:05):
Yeah, maybe let's just tell that story real quick, and I know we're zooming it forward, but just... I have this Twitter thread that I saw between Jack and Elon when they're debating what to call it, and Elon's like, "Birdwatch sounds creepy, I want to change it". Is there anything there you can share?

Keith Coleman (00:35:19):
Yeah, the story there... The story, that's funny. Elon came in, acquired the company, and we had just launched the product relatively recently in the US. It had been in pilot for a year, but we had just made it available US-wide, and I guess he'd been seeing the notes. Soon after the exhibition, he DM'd me and he was like, "Hey, this Community Notes thing is awesome," and I was like, "I'm glad you like it, let's talk," so we talked the next day and he kept referring to it as "This Community Notes thing." I was like, "It's interesting you keep calling it that, because that's actually the very first thing that I called it." The very first figma mockup I made depicting this thing was called "Community Notes." I don't know why, it just felt really natural, so that's the first prototype we had tested.

(00:36:14):
Later, the project changed the same to Birdwatch, but Elon was like, "Hey, let's just call it that." The next day, we just changed the name. It's always notable for the team when you change the name, but really, the team was excited about it. I think it is a much more understandable name. Jack has made fun of it, calling it "The ultimate Facebook name," or something like that.

Jay Baxter (00:36:41):
The most boring Facebook name [inaudible 00:36:44].

Keith Coleman (00:36:44):
Boring name, which is funny, because they're now launching Community Notes. I think it is a very understandable, intuitive name, and I think it has served the product really well. There's a reason it was the name in the very first mockup.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:57):
Yeah, I think descriptive names just makes sense. This connection with Elon, and I want to talk later about just how you've dealt with so many strong personalities over and kept this alive throughout so many changes, but before we get to that, you did something that I think a lot of product leaders, angel leaders, just people that have managed people dream of give up all this power, in air quotes, and career trajectory and influence and just, "Forget all that. I'm going to go back to just building something awesome, small team." Is there any advice there that you could share from that experience that you think might be helpful for other leaders to share or to hear to help them maybe do that same jump? Because that's really difficult in practice. Easy to talk about, hard to do.

Keith Coleman (00:37:42):
Yeah, I think it is a difficult jump. I've done it a bunch of times in my career and I've always been very happy with it, where I started with a small team, that it grew into something bigger, and then I was like, "We're dealing with a lot of big production stuff, team's really big. I want to go back to doing something like crazy and new with a small team again." I've done that sawtooth leap a bunch of times, but it can be hard, because certainly, the natural... The classic career path is, I don't know, rewards or running a large organization or being a manager, or things like that, but I think, at the end of the day, you got to work on stuff you love, you got to be having fun, and I think people want to be having impact.

(00:38:29):
I think there's one myth that can get in people's ways. The idea that the more people you manage or the larger your scope is, the more impact you have. I definitely do not think that is true. I mean, look at Community Notes for example. If I had stayed running a large consumer PM team, what would I have produced? 16 more pages of OKRs? I don't know, a bunch of documents? I think building Community Notes has had way bigger impact on the world. It's become the industry standard for how to deal with this now, which is super cool. People love it, it's the first thing that is plausibly dealing with the internet-scale issue of information quality. I think it's unquestionably a bigger impact than I would've had if I were just doing whatever, doing some standard management track thing like I was doing before. I think that's true of so many other small companies and startups. Someone screenshotted I think it's Blake Scholl's LinkedIn the other day. He went from director of coupons or something to building the first supersonic-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):
Yeah, from Groupon.

Keith Coleman (00:39:41):
Those stories are everywhere when you look, so I definitely have found that, for me, I love building hands-on, I love trying crazy new ideas. I love the zero-to-one experience. It's fun to scale things up too, and it can be fun to operate at scale, but this team is a good example of one that operates at a very large scale, but that is still very small.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
Yeah, I think the way you guys operate is what more and more companies are trying to do, remove middle management layers, create small teams that just execute and build impact, just like Ics. Whenever I say IC, I have a comment on YouTube, where like, "What is IC?" I'm just going to explain, individual contributor, non-manager is when I say the word IC. Let me follow this thread, and when I asked people about how you set up the team to operate effectively and protect it initially, there's this term, "Thermal," that came up a lot. It was like a thermal team, if that's how you describe it.

Keith Coleman (00:40:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:38):
What is thermal?

Keith Coleman (00:40:39):
Yeah, so anyone who's worked in a larger company probably knows that things can get bureaucratic or bogged-down, decision-making can be slow. There's these large planning cycles, people can try to take someone from one team, move them to another at random arbitrary times that can disrupt a project, all sorts of things like that. Our company, this is a number of years ago when we started this project, we had a lot of founders in the company. Kayvon is an example of founder who is helping to run the company, and he had this idea, "Hey, why don't we create this program, call it Thermal, where we could have teams that were somewhat isolated from that." They could run through their own process, they would have one clear owner. The team would be entirely dedicated to that project and we would just repeatedly make funding decisions as to whether to continue the effort.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):
Why was it called Thermal, by the way? What was the idea there?

Keith Coleman (00:41:35):
I think it was an old bird analogy of thermals lifting the bird on their wings. Twitter 1.0 obviously had a lot of bird analogies, bless its heart, so that was one of them. I loved the idea, as someone who liked the startup environment, so when we were starting this project, I was like, "Hey, Kayvon. Why don't we make this the first Thermal project?" And he was like, "Yeah, let's do it," so we started with that way of operating and it gave us, from day one, a lot of freedom and autonomy that I think was really important to make the product work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):
Just be very specific about it. What makes it a Thermal project? How do you set that up? This is asking from perspective, if a company wants to build their own something like this, what does that look like?

Keith Coleman (00:42:24):
Yeah, I think there's a bunch of key attributes. One key attribute is there's one clear driver of the project, who's effectively a founder. I guess maybe you could have two or something, but really clear, there's driver of the project and also there's one clear decision-maker that they go to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:43):
Outside of the team?

Keith Coleman (00:42:44):
Outside of the team. That was true back when we started and it is true now. If we need something or have a question about something, I talk to Elon. It was like that from the beginning, it's like that now, and I think that's a big reason we're able to make decisions effectively, quickly, in a simple way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:02):
It probably has to be someone very senior, not [inaudible 00:43:05] manager.

Keith Coleman (00:43:06):
Someone senior who can make the decisions you need made, whatever they are. I think that's really important, that clear decision-making structure. Another was 100% focus, so everyone on the project is expected to be totally focused on it. A lot of companies, it can be easy to have people's attention spread across a bunch of things, and it makes it hard to get stuff done. You'll talk to whoever that person is, you'll ask them for help on something, and they'll be like, "Yeah, I'll help you. I got to finish this thing, and it'll take me a week or two and then I'll get to it." A week or two delay totally changes the momentum of a project. When we were 100% focused, we talk in the morning, it's like, "Hey, Jay. Why don't we try this thing in the algorithm?" He's like, "Yeah." Then that afternoon or the next day, we're looking at results.

(00:43:59):
Because of that total focus, the rate of iteration goes way up. Then beyond that, there was also just the ability to use whatever our own decision-making process was. We didn't need to write OKRs or... For others standard practices. Obviously, we had to make sure we were responsibly building the product and everything, but we didn't need to use the standard practices. I think that's another great example, OKRs, I understand why they can be helpful, but they can also be not necessarily the right cadence at which to set goals. I think it's really unclear that quarterly or annual goals are actually the right pace. We would set the goal for the next milestone that mattered, and we would work on that. We reached that milestone, we would have an idea of what was coming after, and then when we hit that, we'd set the next milestone. Whether that was two weeks, a month, three months, whatever it was. We set our own pace and goals at that pace, and that just I think is a lot more natural for the development of something.

Jay Baxter (00:45:06):
The whole OKR determination and planning process took longer than it would take us to pick a goal and then execute on it and finish it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
How big was the team early on that you set up? How many engineers?

Keith Coleman (00:45:19):
It started with just me and then, when we decided to build the thing, we figured we needed about five. We wanted it to be as small as we possibly could. It was clear we needed someone on ML doing scoring, it was clear we needed someone to do some client engineering work, someone to do backend engineering work. There may have been one or two other. We needed a designer and a researcher to help us understand the customer base and make sure we were building the thing in a way that was actually going to resonate with people. I think it was backend, frontend, ML, design research. That was the original team, from what I remember.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:01):
Amazing. Basically, one of each function. A question I have for Jay, actually, is there's all this talk of small teams and moving fast, but sometimes you just need more engineers to build the thing. Is there anything you've learned about just how to keep a team small while moving as fast as you are, and not need or need to hire more engineers?

Jay Baxter (00:46:22):
I think, in the beginning when we were iterating on what should even the requirements be, it was definitely good to just have one ML engineer, but I think, at some point, we got clear on what the goals of the algorithm should really be and we tried... I think, at the very beginning, it wasn't clear that we needed to build this bridging-based algorithm. The actual first algorithm that I put into production was very focused on anti-manipulation. It was this page rank variant, but it didn't solve the problem of bias, basically. If there are more users on one side, a page rank type graph algorithm can actually amplify those biases. I think, after building that prototype and getting data from that, it was clear that the bridging-based algorithm was going to be the way that we needed to solve it, and at that point, basically I set up a bake-off. Kind of a Kaggle competition or something. That was the key time where it was really important to pull in other engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
That is such a cool story. I want to follow that thread. Before we do that, you just mentioned you guys yell "Thermal." What does that mean? Is that YOLO, like a version of... Okay.

Keith Coleman (00:47:43):
We're just going to ship, because we're thermal project.

Jay Baxter (00:47:46):
Ship it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):
Okay. Marketers, I know that you love [inaudible 00:47:52], so let me get right to the point. Wix Studio gives you everything you need to cater to any client at any scale, all in one place. Here's how your workflow could look. Scale content with dynamic pages and reusable assets effortlessly, fast-track projects with built-in marketing integrations like Meta, CAPI, Zapier, Google Ads, and more. A-B test landing pages in days, not weeks, with intuitive design tools, connected tracking, and analytics tools, like Google Analytics and Semrush. Encapture key business events without the hassle of manual setup, manage all your client's social media and communications from a unified dashboard, then create, schedule, and post content across all their channels. If you're working on content-rich sites, Wix Studio's No-Code CMS lets you build and manage without touching the design. When you're ready for more, Wix Studio grows with you. Add your own code, create custom integrations with Wix-made APIs, or leverage robust native business solutions. Drive real client growth with Wix Studio. Go to Wixstudio.com.

(00:48:52):
Okay, so coming back to this algorithm, this is actually really interesting, because I've never heard any of this. I was going to ask just what inspired this actual algorithm, and you basically did an internal competition amongst ML engineers to see who had the most successful algorithm. Netflix-contest style, Kaggle style.

Jay Baxter (00:49:09):
Yeah, yeah. This particular idea of finding content that is liked by people on opposite sides of a polarized divider who typically disagree, this was not an idea out of thin air. I think Keith had found some of Chris Bale's work, he had made this list of accounts that were often liked by people who were on both sides politically. There is other projects, like polls out there that look for agreement among people who typically disagree, but I think that it wasn't obvious that our project definitely needed to use that from the very beginning. When you implement it and compare it against these other type... PageRank seems, obviously, it's designed to be manipulation-resistant. Naturally, if you just have a voting ring of people who all vote themselves up, then PageRank can filter that out very well, but that just wasn't the main attack vector, I guess.

(00:50:15):
We had to get some real data from the pilot to realize that, "Okay, the real thing going on here is people are polarized," so it was only once we got that, the real data from the pilot, that I think it was clear that the bridging-based algorithm was the direction we really needed to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:34):
I want to come back to the way you operate the team. I hear that you run the whole team off a single Google Doc that's like a four-year-old doc that you just keep adding goals to, bullet points. Is that true?

Keith Coleman (00:50:47):
There is a very long-running doc that has had to be chopped and purged, because it was breaking Google Docs in Chrome at various points in time. It's like a note-taking doc. It's really where we coordinate what we're doing. The team meets on a daily basis, we spend whatever amount of time we need to get on the same page about what we're building. We might talk about anything from what's most important right now to, "What should we work on next?" To, "What are we trying to launch right now, and why is it not launched? What's in the way of launching it?" We might review new modeling or scoring algorithm update and try to understand what's working in it, what's not. We'll just cover whatever we want or whatever feels most important. As you said, we set our goals very dynamically, so whatever seems like the most important thing for us to work on now and next is what we spend our time on. I think that's served the project really well versus feeling attached to some quarterly goals, or something. We'll look at, "What is going to help people the most?" Or, "What's the biggest problem right now?" What are either one of those? And we will go tackle it. We might change our roadmap multiple times in two weeks based on what we see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:08):
I'm hearing no Jira, no Asana, no Monday.com.

Keith Coleman (00:52:11):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:12):
Okay.

Keith Coleman (00:52:12):
Yeah, I mean, we have to use Jira to coordinate with some other teams. Sometimes when we file a request, we have to make a Jira ticket. But no, I am not a fan of heavyweight task management. I love being on the same page, being able to keep most things in my head, and having a really light way to write down the things that the team can't keep in its head.

Jay Baxter (00:52:34):
We did use Asana briefly, but my memory of it is that you spent more time in the meeting grooming a backlog of irrelevant stuff than actually talking about the proper priorities. I think it's nice in the Google Doc that, if something becomes irrelevant, it can just fall off without needing explicit backlog grooming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:58):
Just to maybe summarize a little bit of how you guys operate that might inspire other companies to set teams up like this, so I'm going to go through a few things you shared. One is one person in charge of the team, like the founder almost. They're basically the founder of the team. They have one very senior, essentially, sponsor/decision-maker that they interface with. In your case, Elon, no big deal. In other cases, it could be the CTO, CPO, someone like that. The team is focused 100% on its product and goal. You keep the team very small, so you start with one person of each function. One front-end engineer, back-end, ML person, designer, researcher, PM, and then Google Docs is almost basically for your project management. Yeah, it's basically run with Google Docs, stop, don't use big, complicated products.

Keith Coleman (00:53:50):
I think that's a pretty good recipe. On the Google Docs, people can do what they want. If they want to use thumbnails, go for it. I think those first ingredients, really, are key structurally. Then beyond that, it's a matter of having an ambitious goal that gets-

Keith Coleman (00:54:00):
And then beyond that, it's a matter of having an ambitious goal that gets people fired up to go do great work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:06):
Yeah. Awesome. I think there's a lot there that a lot of people think they should do when they set these teams up, but they don't actually do, and it feels like each of these is just a really key ingredient to it to actually succeeding.

Keith Coleman (00:54:17):
It definitely really helped us succeed. I don't know that the project would be here if it was not for some of those elements.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:24):
That's a powerful statement. This thing that has changed the way the world understands what is true would not have existed if you didn't set it up in this specific way.

Keith Coleman (00:54:34):
Yeah. I don't know if I would've begun the project had I not known. We had that structure, that ability to make decisions, the autonomy, the speed, the ability to go fast. We started with that in 1.0 and it's been continued and if anything, furthered in X. X as a whole company operates with a lot of those attributes, and I think it's one of the reasons the product is successful. I think those are big reasons why at least, Jay can speak for himself, I have so much fun working on this. I love working on it. It's great to wake up every day and solve these problems. We get to do them efficiently, make decisions quickly, build stuff that helps a lot of people. It's awesome.

Jay Baxter (00:55:25):
This whether thermal or Elon way of operating is definitely more fun and the fact that... That combined with the awesome mission is super important for internal recruiting. I remember when I was first chatting to Keith about this back in early 2020, I had another project. I worked on a few, but one was like personalize the number of push notifications that we send, and it drove a lot of DAU without losing opt-outs significantly. So that was setting me on track, or if I had kept working on that, I could have probably gotten a promotion from that with low risk, or I could take this huge career... It's not as big at a career risk as joining or founding an actual external startup, but there is still career risk, I guess, in joining a team like this. I think all of the same aspects of recruiting that apply to external startups and apply internally, and if you can have an exciting vision, that is key.

Keith Coleman (00:56:30):
Related to that and your list, Lenny, one thing we missed that's super important is that on this project, and I think of successful projects like it in startups, is that people are self-selecting to join. We did not assign anyone to this project. People reached out to join or they applied to join the job. I and the team interviewed every single person that joined the team and we were like, "We want that person on the team. They want to be on the team." And so people are totally bought in to the goal, mission, the way the team works, the other people they're going to be working with. And that makes a huge difference.

(00:57:10):
So a great time to do that is at the start of one of these things. If you're going to try something crazy, it's going to be tough if you're just assigning random people to it. But if you let people opt in and self-select much more likely to be successful. And one thing that I have observed at X, which really surprised me was that this is also possible at a large scale. One of the things that Elon did when he bought the company was he basically asked people to self-select to stay. You had to click the button. And he sent an email out that was like, "Hey, Twitter 2.0."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:44):
Fork in the road. Right? [inaudible 00:57:46]

Keith Coleman (00:57:45):
Fork in the road. Fork in the road. Exactly. He's like, "Twitter 2.0, now X, it's going to be hardcore. We're going to do ambitious things. You're going to work your butt off." And you had to click on the form and say, "Yes, I want to join." And I think that was really important for the company because you want people to opt into that. You want the people to be saying, "Yeah, that's what I want to do," and the company's going to be a lot more successful. If people aren't sure, it's better for them probably to go do something else and where they're naturally more aligned and happier. And I thought that was a great approach to taking a large company and getting it down to people who are really excited about working together on a mission. So for us, we did it from day one, which I think is an easy way to do it, but it's possible to do it later as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):
I love that you described it as fun and I think a lot of people when they see Elon laying off a bunch of people, being very hardcore himself, people don't imagine it as a fun place to work. And it's clear how much you guys love working on this, how fun it is and how interesting it is. And it's interesting to hear that 'cause I think a lot of people don't feel that externally. Is there anything else along the lines of just working for Elon within an org Elon runs that might surprise people about just the way of working that's interesting or surprising or you think other companies might want to think about adopting?

Keith Coleman (00:59:07):
I've always liked lean teams, but my experience at X has made me change the way I would think about running a future org-... If I were to start a company and had to change the way I think about starting that company, I would be even leaner than I would've made it before. I've been amazed with just how much the team is able to accomplish with a small group. And I think because of a small group, shortly after the acquisition, we had this product called Spaces. It had been in the product before, but it was pretty small scale, and Elon wanted to run these large spaces. I forget who the first people he was going to bring on were, but he was going to be there. Ultimately, these things have gone on to host politicians and things like that, and he's like, "Guys, we got to scale this up." I forget the numbers.

(00:59:57):
He's like, "We need to be able to scale a million people," or something like that. I'm getting the numbers wrong. "You need to be able to scale way up." This is the kind of thing at 1.0 That would've taken a year if it had ever happened, and the team did it in two or three weeks. And it was really exciting and inspiring to see. I didn't work on that, but I watched it from the outside. I'm like, "Wow, with this tiny team motivated behind a big goal that was like, 'Hey, guys, it's not like, are we going to do this?' It's, 'We are going to do this.'" They got it done in two or three weeks. That must've felt amazing for them. It was certainly exciting to see. But I've definitely come to appreciate just how lean something can be and not just get by but actually thrive because it's that lean.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):
I think the point you made about people opting into that is important, 'cause I think a lot of people hearing that would be like, "I would never want to be asked to build something like that in two weeks." And I think a lot of people do, and we love that kind of experience, especially working with the Elon, especially shipping something at that scale. But I think there's an important element there of just like, "Okay, I don't want to do that. I have other things to do in my life other than ship spaces." So I think that's a key point you've raised of just there's an opt-in step.

Keith Coleman (01:01:10):
Totally. I think the opt in is important, and it may even be that you want to opt in at one point in your life, and maybe at another point in your life something else is better. I think whatever it is you're choosing to do, it's nice to be opting in to feel like it's aligned with how you want to spend your time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):
Something on my mind, and I don't know if you guys want to go here, but it's something I think a lot of people think about is when Elon came in, he let go of 80% of folks. And everyone's just like, "Twitter is dead. It's all going to fall apart. There's no way they can run this thing with that small of a staff," and clearly they were wrong. Clearly, it's working great. It's becoming a massive deal in the world and continues to grow. Is there anything about that that you were surprised by or anything about just how it continues to operate so well in spite of that big shift?

Keith Coleman (01:01:57):
I think the leaner team, the reduced process in bureaucracy is a big reason it does move as fast as it does. It's easier to get stuff done faster here. Yeah. I think that shrinking is actually a big reason for the increased pace of launches, the increased pace of experimentation. One thing that I noticed a result of that is the people who are here, they seem to all really feel like owners. They take the sense of responsibility that an owner takes in the product. They'll try to track down what's wrong, fix whatever is needed, jump in to help build or fix, improve any system that needs help, even if it's outside of their space. And there's the flip side of that too. For people who've worked at big companies, they may have experienced this thing where there's like ano-... You want to change something in some other system or product, and so you reach out to that team. And maybe they're a little resistant, they'll maybe be like, "Oh, we'll get to that next quarter or so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:07):
They have their own goals to hit. Yeah. [inaudible 01:03:08]

Keith Coleman (01:03:08):
Yeah. Exactly. They don't really necessarily want to help you or they're busy. Here, you're like, "Hey, guys, we need to do this thing with that other system you work on." And they're like, "Great! Here's the code. Here are the docs. Send us the fab if you have any questions, and we'll get it in." And it's just the thing, you can just jump in and get it done. And that kind of collaborative effort, like the sense of shared ownership, I think from my experience came from or was a result of the shrinking of the team down to people who wanted to be there and work together to build this thing. So I think that's been a really positive impact. It's not always easy. Certainly, a lot of people have a lot of responsibilities, but they're here because they're up for it.

Jay Baxter (01:03:53):
Yeah. I think one other thing that's key is when you are forced to have such a small team, well, this is important anyways, but deleting code is more important than writing it a lot of the time. So I think so often maybe due to promotion incentives or just regular human tendency, engineers have a tendency to add these little incremental wins that actually add more of a long-term maintenance cost than is clear, because you just run a little one month A-B test, you see this significant win and you don't realize the maintenance burden you just added to your team for the rest of eternity until you turn the thing off. So I think there's a lot to be gained and you get forced to do this, by the way, when you have such a small team. It's just auditing parts of your system and deleting the things where the maintenance cost is worse than the gains. So I think we did have to do this across the company after the big layoffs, and systems are leaner now and they can be worked on by fewer numbers of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):
That's an amazing point. I remember Elon's being like, "Here, we have to throw away the whole thing. We have to re-architect everything. It's stupid the way it's built." And it sounds like that actually worked.

Jay Baxter (01:05:10):
Yeah, so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:10):
Well.

Jay Baxter (01:05:11):
You don't have to rewrite everything from scratch. Some things are good, I guess, to rewrite. But just even deleting the unnecessary cruft and keeping the rest of the core system, that's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:23):
I love that we're creating a formula to run these sorts of companies and teams. There's so much here. I want to go back to the building of the original product. I took us on a long tangent and an amazing tangent, but I heard a story of when you launched Birdwatch at that point. You specifically wanted to keep expectations very low and there was a GIF in the thing, and it just looked like clearly this is not ready for prime time. Talk about just how you did that, how you launched it in a way where people weren't like, "It's never going to work."

Keith Coleman (01:05:53):
We were very disciplined, I guess you could say, about having the product prove itself at every given point. When we built the first mockups, these were just pictures of depicting what community notes might look like. We showed those to people across the political spectrum. We saw, hey, people really like these. Whether they're on the right or left, they seem very open to reading these community notes even when they're critical to people of their own side. So we're like, "All right. That gives us confidence that if we can build this, if we can actually make this as a reality, it's going to work." Then there's a question of can we make it a reality? Will people in the real world be able to write notes that are of this quality?

(01:06:35):
And so we had an internal pilot test version of this where you could write notes. And we first basically ran this through an Amazon MTurk type of participant test just to see if you just put some normal people in there, will they be able to write these notes? All those notes weren't good, but it was clear that there were people out there who could write good notes. So then like, "Okay, this is possible. What will happen if we actually do this out in the real world? And let's run a pilot and find out." And so we took that pilot that we'd run the MTurk of test on, and we released it to at first 1000 people, totally out in public, and we didn't know what was going to show up. You could imagine the notes could have been terrible.

(01:07:27):
And so we were talking, "Well, what do we do? We're going to put this out there. Everyone's going to have all these questions. They're probably going to be really skeptical, and we know it might be a total dumpster fire. And so what do we do to set expectations appropriately?" We felt like we could probably get there in the end, but we just didn't know what was going to happen at first. We wanted to set expectations, and so we're like, "Well, why don't we just stick..." There's the page where you see a post in the notes below. We're like, "Why don't we just stick a dumpster fire GIF on that page?" And you go there, you're like, "Hey, anything you see below here might just be a total dumpster fire. At least it would show we were aware of that as a possible risk." In the end, we did not do that. It cracked me up, but we thought it was like-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):
Oh, you didn't actually launch. Okay. That was just a concept. Okay.

Keith Coleman (01:08:16):
We had mockups of it, and every time I looked at the mockup, I laughed, but ultimately we had so much to explain on that page, like, what is this thing and how does it work? Ultimately, we're like, "Okay, this is probably going to distract from the point." So we pulled it. I wish maybe it had seen the light of day at one point, but yeah, ultimately we kept it simple and we focused that page on explaining what was going on here. But again, as has happened many times with the project, we put the pilot out there and the notes were good.

(01:08:48):
They weren't all good. It was a mixed bag, but there was gold in there. And from the very early days with just 1000 contributors, it was obvious that people could write notes that were informative, that were neutral, that spoke to controversial challenging topics, and that if we could just identify those from the rest, this was going to work. It was going to work as well as the very first mockups we had made. So that became the focus that is, how do we sift out the gold from the rest?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
I think you may have shared with this with me, when someone noticed you guys were testing this and they took screenshots and tweeted it, and I think Elon replied, "This is cool."

Keith Coleman (01:09:27):
Yeah. Yeah. So in the very early days when it was just a Figma prototype, we were running these usertesting.com on moderated studies. I guess one of the participants sent one to an NBC reporter who wrote a bunch of stories on it. Anyway, that day, there was a lot of chatter about it on the service, and Elon... To put this back in time perspective, this is, I think, 2020, so two years before any acquisition stuff happened, Elon is just a Twitter user building rockets and electric cars and other cool stuff and stumbles on this thing that depicts the prototype that we've been testing. And he writes back, "Definitely worth trying, IMO." And I remember thinking that was cool back then and it's interesting to see, he's obviously had a very consistent point on it. I think the idea was appealing and he has obviously been a big fan of it in the product and had been a big supporter proponent. So yeah, it was cool that it came from... that support has been from the very early days before he was ever involved in the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
I love that moment. That must have felt really wild for Elon to be commenting on this Figma prototype retesting.

Keith Coleman (01:10:42):
It was cool. It was cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:44):
Oh, man. So when we were preparing for this interview, I asked you guys what's the main thing you want to make sure people get and understand about why community notes has been so effective? And Keith, you specifically said that it was the principles behind how you wanted to approach this and how you continue to stick to this throughout. And we'll talk about how you kept it alive throughout all these different CO changes in leaders. But just talk about these principles, what the actual principles are and why that was so key to it working out.

Keith Coleman (01:11:16):
There are a number of principles that I think when we first shared them with people at the company seemed maybe a little bit crazy. But I think they are the reason the product works, and I think they've been very important, and we do. We come back to them regularly, today, all the time. Probably the craziest one is just that this thing is going to be the voice of the people. It's going to represent the voice of people. It's not going to represent the company's voice. So it is not a tech company deciding what shows. It is the people deciding what shows, and that had a lot of implications on the design. First of all, we don't have a button that will change the status of a note. So if a note is showing because the people have rated it and found it helpful, it is going to show. We can't change that.

(01:12:08):
And that is the kind of thing that when we first propose this, that's unsettling to people. They're like, "Wait, so something can go up and the company can't take it down, or can't change its status, get it to stop showing." And we're like, "Yeah, and it has to work that well. If it doesn't work well enough to do that, then it doesn't work." This is one of our key principles was, if there's a problem with a note that's so bad, you want to do something about it's a problem with the system. We need to redesign the system to be showing good notes. And so yeah, we had to get everyone comfortable with the idea that there was no button to change the status of a note. Similarly, as we talked about earlier, we wanted this to represent all of humanity.

(01:12:53):
And so we didn't want to be arbiters of who can come in and be a contributor and who can't. So we open it to everyone. You just have to meet a really basic objective criteria. You have to have a verified phone to help reduce the likelihood of having bots or things like that participating. But beyond that, it's random selection and it still is that way today. And again, that people took some time to get people comfortable with it. But I think that the fact that this is the voice of the people and reflects their output through an open and transparent process is so key to both why it is good, why it works, but also why it's trusted. So that's number one and I think will forever be the heart of the product. Another one that people thought was crazy was transparency.

(01:13:49):
The previous approaches to dealing with misleading info, it felt to a lot of people, like black box tech companies or media companies or leads or whatever making decisions. We're like, "People need to get comfortable with this. They need to trust this. So the whole thing has to be out in the open." The code that decides what notes share has to be out in the open. All of the data and ratings that make it happen have to be out in the open. People should be able to take the code and data and replicate the whole service and that we have done exactly what we've said we've done. And they should be able to audit it. They should be able to go and look and say, "Hey, I think this part could be better."

(01:14:28):
Or if they think we're biased, they should be able to work with the data and point it out. And if people have good observations, that should factor back into the code. And this is, again, something that's difficult to get people comfortable with, that everything is out there, you can't cover anything up. But I think that's so essential to people trusting it. Yeah, we set these out on day one. We go back to them constantly because we're always evolving the product, and we're always like got to make sure every new change is open. Whenever we update the scoring system, there's an update in GitHub when the data is published daily so you can download it. And so yeah, I think those have been really essential to the thing working.

Jay Baxter (01:15:13):
And by the way, these do not come without a cost. It's actually really hard from an end perspective to actually open source the actual algorithm that's running on the actual data. Because the way large-scale services like this are usually architected does not naturally lend itself to being run as a script by someone who's downloaded a TSV. So we actually have to take weird architectural decisions to make this possible in a way that probably wouldn't have been if we didn't start with this assumption from scratch. We would've had to maybe rewrite the system to make it like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:49):
What's an example of that?

Jay Baxter (01:15:50):
For instance, there's a matrix factorization that we train. Usually, you would train a matrix factor... train your ML model once and then serve it, I guess with a separate service. But we didn't want to have people externally spinning up services to be able to replicate the system that we had. So basically, I don't think it would've been actually very cool if we had open sourced the code in a way that wasn't actually runnable, I guess, by someone just... At this point, you can download Python code and run a script. You do need a lot of RAM right now, but you can do it on one machine.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
Okay. How much RAM are we talking about?

Jay Baxter (01:16:37):
Oh, only like 500 gigs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):
Okay. Okay. That's reasonable.

Jay Baxter (01:16:41):
It'll take a day if you don't do anything special to speed it up. Good to know, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:45):
Cool.

Jay Baxter (01:16:46):
Possible is the key thing, and people have done it. Vitalik Buterin had a blog post where he talks about his explorations, making sure the algorithm really does what it says it does. And I think just the fact that a handful of people have done this, there's enough people who have done it that there's someone you'd probably trust who's verified it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
And that's rolling out to Meta. No big deal. I love just as you described these principles, just I could imagine a PM at a company being like, "Okay, guys. Here, I want to do this project." There's so much idealism to it that rarely works in real life; going to be open source. You're going to give it to everyone. We don't have actual control over what it's going to do, don't worry about it. It's going to just change the way people see this thing that we've been very careful about and then it works. And I think that's very rare and it's really impressive. And what I'm hearing partly is that sticking to those principles was actually really fundamental to it working and not bending over when someone's like, "No, no, no, we can't do this. What if we change this part?"

Keith Coleman (01:17:54):
I think if we had broken with any of those principles, if there was anything black box, if there was whatever, the product would be a lot harder to trust. And so I think it's because we've just stuck to them so cleanly simply that people can trust it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:11):
You've talked about a few moments when it was like, wow, the White House changed their announcement because of the community note. We talked about the dog is a cat. Are there any other moments that after you launched of, "Holy shit, this is working? This is going to actually work."

Keith Coleman (01:18:26):
All along, we saw it working. We wanted to be confident whenever we expanded it to new audiences or new countries or whatever, we wanted to be confident it was going to work. So maybe held our breath a little bit just to see that it would do what we expected, but we always expected that. But that said, there were definitely stress cases. The one that comes to mind is the start of the Israel Hamas conflict in 2023 in October. That was probably the largest deluge of misleading information I've ever seen shared on the internet at one time. It was overwhelming. A number of photos and videos and whatever coming out related to that, it was insane. And just to give you an example, I think it was first three days or something of that conflict, we had 500 notes covering all sorts of different... out of context imagery.

(01:19:32):
Someone would say, "Hey, this is happening here." It's actually from 2013 in Syria. There were people making fake battle footage in the video game simulator Arma 3. So there were notes explaining, this stuff looked realistic. And unless you saw the note, you wouldn't really know. There are all sorts of claims about what was going on in the ground, and that was definitely... The product was still pretty new at that point. We'd expanded in the U. S. less than a year before that. We had been rolling out throughout the world that year and then this large event happened. And I felt like we were just enough prepared at the right time for the system to be able to handle that.

(01:20:16):
Probably one of the most important things we did right before that was launch the ability to write notes on images and videos and have those matched to other posts. I remember at that time thinking, "Wow, I'm glad we launched that feature a few months ago versus still had it on the shelf," because it was really important in that conflict. And I think even it was just a few weeks before we had launched a major speed up in notes too. When we first built the product, the number one focus was always quality. We knew that the product would live and die by the quality of the notes. That was the thing we could never give up on. We also knew it needed to deliver speed and scale, but we're like, "We will get the quality in the right place, and we can speed it up and scale-

Keith Coleman (01:21:00):
Get the quality in the right place and we can speed it up and scale it out over time. And we had actually just launched a speed-up that took three hours off the time it needed to go live, and it was I think a matter of weeks before that conflict happened, so again, super glad that was out there. In the first few days of the conflict the median time from a post going live to a note showing up was five hours, which is like crazy fast. Typical fact checking is like two to four, at least it's really common to see it take two to four days. These notes were showing up in five hours and we're like, we are so glad we got those things out before this happened, it made the service a lot more helpful.

Jay Baxter (01:21:40):
One other thing that was, I think, nice to see working then was, one criticism of Community Notes some people bring up is, well if you always need agreement from people who typically disagree, then in these super polarized settings, that conflict being probably number one, then you wouldn't see any notes. But actually the reality was there were tons of notes about that conflict. So I think there was this kind of nice property where actually, and maybe this is a surprising fact, that there's more agreement out there across polarized divides than maybe conventional wisdom says, and the places where people agreed were really objectively true and verifiable. I guess maybe this is more true the more polarized the setting is, but where the agreement actually lends you, and basically notes that are very neutrally written, very focused on the facts and easy to verify information.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):
There's this talk for a while of just there's no more facts, nobody believes there is a single true fact anymore, everything is subjective, and I think Community Notes proves the opposite. Facts matter, there are facts that we can all agree with even on the most controversial topics.

Keith Coleman (01:23:04):
Yeah, we saw this really from day one, when we would show those prototypes to people just depicting the idea, it was really obvious that people cared more about, or they cared a lot about understanding reality and what was going on and they were willing to disagree with their side, so to speak, to recognize that. And I think that's not always that obvious to people. The world does feel really polarized, but people definitely are willing to cross partisan boundaries to get to accurate information and that's why the product works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):
It feels like as we rely more and more on what we know and understand about the world is becoming social media online and moving this quickly, it's like I'm so thankful this exists because otherwise it'd just be, what do we trust anymore? This being out aligns with we need this thing to exist at the same time. And it feels like at the same time there's also people I just don't trust. I think people have shifted from I trust what I read to, okay, I shouldn't just believe everything I'm reading. Is there anything there you're noticing about just how people think about news they see and their shift of just like, I'm not going to believe everything. Is there anything that you've noticed about just human behavior or just the way we've shifted understanding what is true?

Keith Coleman (01:24:30):
We haven't done any research to look broadly at how people's perceptions are changing there, but I certainly have found myself that particularly seeing notes, I am more skeptical about what I read at first, and I think that's been helpful. And we hear that from people, that they think about things a bit more, and I think that's a good secondary effect and benefit of something like this, which is the more you see the patterns of how what you're reading can be wrong, the more you can thoughtfully question it and try to get a better understanding of what's really going on. So historically I think this was called media literacy, but basic idea of can you understand the ways in which things can go wrong and try to cut them yourself.

Jay Baxter (01:25:21):
Another aspect I think we help with that is discovery of the Community Notes. I think often before Community Notes you could have just been living in a little news filter bubble, or maybe there were fact checks out there that you should have been reading but you weren't discovering them. So the fact that the note applies, it is directly attached to the post and visible by anyone who sees the post helps cross those filter bubbles and can kind of... I think for some people it's the first time they've actually seen counter arguments to claims made in their own little echo chamber.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:59):
That's incredible, yeah. I love the point you're making about how it actually teaches people to be a little more skeptical of the things they read. It's an education system more than just, here, this one thing is wrong. I love that.

(01:26:13):
Okay, just a few more questions. There was an audience question asked on Twitter, we all asked on Twitter, "What do people want to know about Community Notes?" one was actually why you guys switched to anonymous contributors, what was the decision behind that?

Keith Coleman (01:26:26):
Yeah, we had this pilot where we were testing with a small number of contributors, a few thousand contributors, and we learned a lot through that pilot. Probably the biggest thing we learned was related to anonymity or pseudonymity of contributors. We had originally assumed that it was important that people contribute under their real handle, or their real name, or whatever it was. The first prototypes depicted that, we kind of thought that would be important for people trusting the note, and actually it was totally wrong. The best option was actually opposite of what we first tried.

(01:27:02):
We found a few things. One, people were hesitant to write a note on a controversial topic because they didn't want to get attacked or harassed online. And so some people were comfortable doing this but others were not, and so it meant there was more potential good notes to be written than were getting written, and this was very clear feedback from the pilot.

(01:27:24):
Two, and this is super interesting, people are actually more willing to cross partisan boundaries when they are anonymous or pseudonymous than when they are under their real name, and it intuitively makes a lot of sense. If you publicly are using your name, you feel are affiliated with one side versus the other, you might hesitate to be perceived as breaking with that side. But you may actually, for example, find a note helpful that's critical of that side, and there's a bunch of studies that show when people are anonymous, they're much more willing to cross partisan boundaries and work with the other side, agree with the other side, and we saw that too. And so by allowing people to be pseudonymous, you actually get more honest answers about what they really think and it helps find disagreement that really-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:11):
That's so counterintuitive.

Keith Coleman (01:28:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:12):
You never hear the opposite always, and it's so interesting it's the opposite.

Keith Coleman (01:28:15):
Yeah, yeah.

Jay Baxter (01:28:17):
I think the same principle applies to making the likes private.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:21):
I was just thinking that.

Jay Baxter (01:28:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:23):
Yeah, I like a lot more stuff that's a little, definitely, I wouldn't have liked, yeah.

Keith Coleman (01:28:28):
It allows freedom for honesty, which is pretty great. And one of the criticisms of pseudonymity is it can generate, maybe people have reached the quality threshold that they put out there, but we have so many quality mechanisms in the system that that wasn't an issue, so we could keep quality high while opening up for that honesty.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:48):
Another question, you touched on this a little bit, which is around navigating the existing trust and safety apparatus of Twitter, which as you described, basically, previously, it was like we make decisions on what is true and not, and every company works this way, you guys basically upended that like, here's a completely different way, you have no control over what we say is true or not. Talk about just that experience of overcoming that, I imagine, very difficult hurdle of like, okay, forget all that, we're going to do it totally different.

Keith Coleman (01:29:20):
Yeah, it was definitely, what we were proposing was very different. I will say that I think people were sort of open-minded to it, generally speaking, and I think everyone had a sense that what was being done at the time wasn't really working that well or solving the problem, and people were open to new ideas, so that's a good foundation.

(01:29:39):
But I think one thing we did that was probably very helpful in that is we wanted the product to prove itself at any point. First it had to prove that people could possibly find notes helpful, then it had to prove that people could possibly write these notes that would be good quality. And so anytime that we were proposing doing something with the product, like running some research test, or running the pilot, or expanding the pilot, we always had the data that had convinced us that that was a good decision, like we were stepping into the next phase of expansion that made sense. And so I think we probably rarely proposed anything that seemed unwise, because we were holding such a high bar for quality ourselves, and I suspect that went a long way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:33):
So it's partly, what I'm hearing is, take it step by step to prove this is actually working, and partly be confident it is working to yourself before you try to convince the trust and safety team this is the way to go.

Keith Coleman (01:30:46):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:49):
Was there a moment along that journey it shifted from no way this is a thing to okay, wow, let's actually consider this? Or was it this very gradual process?

Keith Coleman (01:30:59):
Whether other people were saying no way to wow, let's actually-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Yeah, just internally of just like, okay, we're going to actually stop this trust and safety way of operating and instead rely on Community Notes, was there a moment of like, okay, let's actually make that switch, or was that Elon actually, is that the big switch?

Keith Coleman (01:31:15):
The biggest change there happened in X, the biggest changes prior to that were just the decision to put this out there and have it be operating in public at first US wide scale. But yeah, then the bigger switches came in the X period.

Jay Baxter (01:31:36):
I think even though there was original research before Birdwatch had even started, or Community Notes had even started, from external researchers showing that crowdsourced fact-checkers, laypeople can do about as well as fact-checkers and actually the agreement rates were kind of similar between the groups. I think even though that research was out there, I think there were definitely a lot of people who didn't really believe it could work until it already worked.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:04):
Basically prove it, prove that it works. Yeah, that makes sense, versus just a bunch of docs and strategy and thinking, it's just like, look, it's actually working, you can see for yourself.

Jay Baxter (01:32:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:14):
Makes sense. Okay, possibly last question, we'll see which fractals of questions you guys bring up here. I referenced this a couple times, this incredible achievement of keeping a project alive through Jack and then, I have this note, and Kayvon running the show then, and then Parag running Twitter, and then Elon, and then Linda taking over as CEO, quite rare, especially something this visible, this impactful to everything that X is. Any lessons or keys to that actually working, of this project surviving throughout so many work changes and leaders?

Keith Coleman (01:32:54):
It definitely has been a crazy time to be building something. It's been fun. The craziness has been entertaining. I think one reason perhaps the product has done so well and survived is the nature of the product itself. It is designed to produce information that is found helpful by people who normally disagree. And so even if you have CEOs or leaders who might disagree, there's a good chance actually they'll find it helpful, they'll be like, wow, this thing does produce pretty useful output. So I think there's something in the nature of the product itself, that when people see it, whatever side they're on, left, up, down, they're likely to find it pretty helpful, so I do think that helps.

(01:33:39):
I also think the team executed really well. We had ambitious goals that were exciting, they solved a real problem. This is a real problem that matters in the world. At every step, as we talked about, the product needed to prove itself, and we would make sure it proved itself and we would bring the results that convinced us and we'd share those with people. And so they would say, oh yeah, I agree, it kind of proved itself, let's take the next leap. And we've done that all along the way and we continue to operate that way, and I think that focus on the outcome and goal that matters, and executing against it, really helped.

(01:34:24):
The team did not get distracted by much all through the period during which the acquisition happened. There was a lot of opportunity for distraction. This team was shipping every week, we were super focused on the goal, let's make this thing work, let's get these notes out there, and I think people saw that execution and were excited to support it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:49):
Yeah, like it's working, why would we mess with that? And it's important, and it keeps us from having to hire tens of thousands of people to fact check.

Keith Coleman (01:34:57):
The interesting thing about that is no one ever asked us or brought up or seemed to care about anything related to cost savings in this process. And I think that's an assumption people have outside the company, that this must have been a reason there was interest in it. But that was never a goal, it was not at all why the project was started, it was not why people were excited about the project. And I think that's also, for people outside who maybe don't see the conversations, it's kind of a heartening thing to know, is that the focus was always on solving the problem. The other approach is even if you had 10,000 people doing it, the real issue is that they don't work that well because they're not trusted or they don't scale or they're too slow. And so the goal was really always just help people stay informed at scale. Let's build an internet scale solution to an internet scale problem that people like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:51):
Something I heard about you, Keith, when I was asking people about how this worked and why this worked so well is that they describe you with having a very low ego, and that allowed you to give up this whole team and power and influence and just the name, forget it, whatever you want, we'll call it Community Notes, great. Is there anything in there you can share of just how you think about that and how important that is as a product leader to have a low ego?

Keith Coleman (01:36:19):
For me, this project, I feel like I get to do community service with this project. I see my work as in service of the people and the community, and that's what motivates me. The only thing that I care about is delivering the outcome that the world finds helpful. And so in some ways the project has not been about ego, it's about truth-seeking, let's find... Not truth in the sense of what information is true, but let's find out what's actually going to make this work. How does it need to be structured, what should it be called? Whatever is going to produce the best outcome is what we should do. So I think I feel more attached to the product being helpful than to anything else, and so to whatever degree it might seem like low ego is probably more a result of wanting to actually solve the problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:15):
And I think partly what I'm hearing is just if you win and succeed, good things will happen, so focus on that.

Keith Coleman (01:37:20):
Certainly satisfying things will happen, it's very satisfying to have people appreciate it. It's satisfying that people on the left and right love it. It's satisfying that even people who receive notes, love notes, and reach out to them and post them, that's amazing, it feels so good to have helped give people that, and yeah, it's very motivating. It's a great reason to wake up in the morning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:44):
It's absurd this has worked, but it's also like of course this would work, of course something like this should work. It's like such interesting-

Keith Coleman (01:37:50):
It's the internet, it's of the internet, that's why it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:55):
Oh man. Where's Community Notes going from here? What's happening, where's it going, what's the future?

Keith Coleman (01:38:03):
We're always working on basically more better notes faster. So there's clearly an opportunity to get more notes out there, we want them to stay as good or better than they are, we want to get them there faster, so we're always working on core product changes to help deliver that. Recently, for example, we just released an update to what we call the Community Notes bat signal, or the ability to request a Community Note. So anyone on X can say, "Hey, I think this post needs a Community Note," and now they can even add a source explaining why so that when a prospective writer sees that it's much easier for them to write a note. So we're always working on core things like that, core algorithm improvements.

(01:38:47):
I think there are also new frontiers that show a lot of potential, AI and LLMs are one. It's easy to imagine a lot of ways that AI could assist the people in this task they're doing of trying to get information out there quickly. And maybe Jay should talk about the Supernotes work that we've done with some folks outside the company.

Jay Baxter (01:39:13):
Yeah, so one cool thing about having public data and code is that external researchers can collaborate with you, and in this case Supernotes had this idea that we can basically take existing notes as input, existing proposed notes that maybe they have some problem, maybe they have part of the story, maybe they're worded in kind of a biased way. Basically take all these in, have an LLM generate a ton of different variants, and then basically make the simulated jury to basically get a representative group of contributors for community notes who would be rating the note and try to predict based on their past ratings how they would rate these LLM generated notes. And so this way you can actually, rather than just having an LLM write a note from scratch and hoping it's good, you can simulate the entire community notes rating process and explicitly create notes that are likely to be rated helpful by people.

(01:40:18):
So I think ideas like that are very promising for the future, and it's a nice way that LLMs and humans can work together. Obviously agents can browse the web too, and that's one way that you could imagine agents assisting humans is maybe checking whether a note is actually supported by the source. Although then you get into things like, well, are people going to actually be as diligent? Right now I think raters are very diligent because they know just some Community Notes contributor wrote this like, I better check this before I rate it helpful. But hopefully we can design things in a way such that people don't trust the output and actually verify it themselves before issuing a helpful rating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):
Yeah, that is such an interesting area to explore where you want to avoid AI hallucinating slop versus make it easier and scale it even further. What an interesting challenge.

Keith Coleman (01:41:23):
What's cool about this project, in addition to the AI element, is that it's being done outside the company. We talked earlier about the open source transparency. The key reason we made this all open source was so people could see how it worked, but the dream is actually that, it's not just that the contributions to the notes and ratings are from the people, but the dream is actually the product is built by the people. What if the scoring algorithm were significantly or entirely written by the public? That would be incredible. And Supernotes is probably the first very substantial potential change in the algorithm of the way it works, that was kind of coming from the outside and plausibly could be part of the core, so we'd love to see the product go in that direction as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:08):
Sweet, go Supernotes. Well guys, the work you're doing is tremendous. This is every product person's dream, I think to work, on something like this. Small team, lots of support, lots of impact, just innately interesting, and so I think this is going to inspire a lot of people.

(01:42:27):
So let me just ask you, is there anything else you wanted to share? Anything else you think might be helpful for folks to leave them with?

Jay Baxter (01:42:33):
Sure, I guess one thing that just I thought was interesting over the course of working on this product is just there's... I think in a similar way to how retweets originally were not something Jack came up with, I think users just started doing it and then it became a core part of the product. There's a huge way already in which there's just a lot of surprising things that people wanted to use Community Notes for that I don't think we really expected, and it's kind of cool to see those user desires emerge.

(01:43:04):
I think one example, I guess we had always been imagining political type of misinformation, but for whatever reason there's a lot of people who love debating whether Messi or Ronaldo got more goals. I guess it's kind of a funny one. There's a community moderation aspect, so I think we also thought that this would be specifically for adding context to misleading or potentially misleading information, but what you can see is that there are some notes that go beyond that towards calling out content that they think is spammy or something. So I think that's just another dimension in which commuted notes is a product that's driven by the people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:57):
That's so beautiful, basically they're trying to keep Twitter/X healthy and they're just like, no, this should be taken down, this tweet of spam.

Jay Baxter (01:44:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:06):
I love that. Is there an answer on the Messi versus, who is the other soccer player?

Jay Baxter (01:44:10):
Ronaldo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:11):
Ronaldo, okay. Is there a definitive fact there or is that just unknowable?

Jay Baxter (01:44:17):
Yeah, I guess that's an interesting one because it's a case where raters are actually very polarized. I guess it actually kind of fits into the core algorithm where there's some people who are just diehard Messi fans or Ronaldo fans, just like they could be on politics, so we actually specifically modeled that topic, as well as some other topics, so we can estimate people's opinion on that particular debate. It's kind of funny that something like that would emerge.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:45):
You're saying that's the most controversial topic on X, Ronaldo versus Messi.

Jay Baxter (01:44:51):
That's a controversial one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:52):
Oh wow, who knew? Okay. Keith, is there anything you wanted to add?

Keith Coleman (01:44:58):
Yeah, community Notes is cool itself, but I think what it points to about society is actually even bigger. Society often feels really polarized, you hear people talk about it all the time, no one can ever agree on anything, but actually Community Note shows you people really can agree on quite a lot. Even on super controversial topics related to politics and everything, there's a lot of agreement, that's why notes work.

(01:45:23):
And I think that's a really big reason for optimism about the world, is that while it might feel polarized, there's probably like an 80% set of people that agree on quite a lot of things. And imagine if we could use the same kind of approaches we use with notes, but to find agreement on legislation, or policies, or things like that that people want the government or the world to do, possibly we could get a lot more momentum behind these ideas that the people really want and everyone would be a lot happier. Maybe 10% of the people on the edges wouldn't be happy, but I bet there's a lot of agreement that we are not identifying, and if we did it, we'd all be pretty happy. So I don't know, I think it's easy for people to feel pessimistic about the world, but I think this product is a good reason to be optimistic about the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:12):
What an incredible way to end it. I can also see, Keith, why people want to join you and work with you and work on this team.

Keith Coleman (01:46:19):
Appreciate it. If you do want to join, we are hiring an ML engineer. You get to work on these amazing problems with us and have a lot of fun, so we're accepting applications at x.com/communitynotes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:32):
Okay, great, I'm glad you gave the URL. Oh man, you're about to get flooded.

(01:46:36):
Guys, thank you so much for doing this. Is there anywhere other than that place to go off, join the team as an ML engineer, is there any other place you want to point people to, either your socials or anything else?

Keith Coleman (01:46:47):
I'm KeithColeman on X, please reach out if you have any feedback or want to help us out, whether you may want to work here or want to do something from the outside, we would love to talk.

Jay Baxter (01:46:58):
Yeah, I'm @ _JayBaxter_ at X. Yeah, I think in particular, besides just using Community Notes, it would be great to get more substantial contributions, pull requests, collaborate on projects like Supernotes, I think that's the most exciting type of stuff if people do want to contribute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:22):
Ship some code guys. Amazing. Guys, thank you so much for doing this.

Keith Coleman (01:47:27):
Thanks for having us, Lenny.

Jay Baxter (01:47:29):

## Transcript

Keith Yandell (00:00):
Every business that you have heard of has gotten rejected by at least a handful of venture capitalists at one point or another. And so that drive to keep going if you believe in the business is critical, absolutely critical. I mean, we were weeks of runway situation and had been told no by everyone. And it was just Tony's drive, really, to keep going. And the way he explains it to me is it's just the difference between a founder and a non-founder. If you're really a founder, you just have to find a way. You have to keep going. There's no question. And I mean, that's the only advice I can give folks, is it only takes one yes. But you got to keep going.

Lenny (00:44):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Keith Yandell. Keith is a longtime leader at DoorDash, where he's been for about seven years. And in that time, get this, he's led the legal team, the HR team, the marketing team, the customer support team, and currently he leads the BD and corporate development teams. Before DoorDash, he led litigation at Uber. He's also managed folks like Gokul Rajaram, who was previously on this podcast and who suggested that I have Keith on. And damn, was he right. Before I had this chat with Keith, I didn't know that much about him, but now you can count me as a huge Keith fanboy. I suspect you'll feel the same way after you listen to this episode. I'm just going to jump right in and bring you Keith Yandell after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Lenny (01:38):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file.

Keith Yandell (03:15):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (03:17):
First off the bat, I just want to give a big thank you to Gokul Rajaram and Micah Moreau for suggesting you be on the podcast, helping make this happen, and also just suggesting a bunch of questions to ask you. So, I hope you're ready to be in the hot seat.

Keith Yandell (03:29):
Definitely as ready as I'm going to be. And those are two good folks to talk to.

Lenny (03:34):
Awesome. And Gokul's been on the podcast. Maybe we'll get Micah on the podcast at some point. I wanted to start off with a story. Apparently, there's a story of you interviewing what is now your VP of engineering. And I hear that in the interview, you called him an asshole. And more interestingly, he joined DoorDash because you did that. Can you just talk about that story and share that story?

Keith Yandell (03:55):
Yeah, actually, it wasn't during the interview. We were debriefing. And for me, one of the top things I always hear about DoorDash from an executive standpoint when we do the internal survey is it's a "no politics, no asshole" culture. And I'm not one to swear a lot, but after interviewing Ryan Sokol, who's now our VP of eng, he was just kind of aloof. He came off as aloof to me, really curt answers. And I just didn't have a great feeling about him. And I pride myself on being able to discern when people are really engaged or not. And I went to Tony Xu, who's our founder and CEO. I said, "Tony, I think this guy's a jerk. I don't think we want him at the company." And Tony was great. He said, "Keith, I want you to just have dinner with him, please, because I got a completely different impression. And if you have dinner with him, and you still think he's a jerk, we won't hire."

Keith Yandell (04:51):
And so I ended up meeting Ryan down the street. We actually live in the same general area. We went out to dinner, and I started right away. I said, "Ryan, during the interview you kind of seemed like an asshole. Are you an asshole?" And he was so great. It completely changed my perspective in a good two minutes. He wanted to know what he had said. He said, "I'm super embarrassed, and what could I do differently? Regardless of how this works out for me in this circumstance, that's just not how I want to be perceived." And we talked and joked about the things he had done, and he kind of told me the background for how he reacted or why he reacted the way he did. And by the end of the dinner, we ended up staying super late. We had a couple beers afterwards. Ryan and I have become really good friends.

Keith Yandell (05:37):
And six months later, he told me that one of the reasons why he joined DoorDash was that we were going to blackball him potentially from joining just because of his attitude, because his perspective is life's too short to work with people you don't really enjoy, and a lot of people pay lip service. And he knew he was going to be a tough hire for us at the time. And the fact we were willing to go all the way down the path and have someone super qualified but didn't meet the culture bar, for him was what pushed him over the edge to join the company.

Lenny (06:06):
I love that. I love the directness of that meeting, of just like, "Are you an asshole?"

Keith Yandell (06:11):
Think about it, right? And if someone really was a jerk, they probably wouldn't have taken it very well. Right? It's just like when you're interviewing someone, giving them tough feedback after the interview if there's an area of concern, but you otherwise like them, can be a really great way to see how they would interact with you personally as well as how they take feedback. And so that was my learning from the situation, is if you really enjoy an interview, except for maybe something on the culture side, to give the direct feedback and see how people engage.

Lenny (06:39):
This touches on another question I wanted to ask you, which is just about DoorDash's culture, which feels really unique, just feels very driven, very pragmatic. There's a story I heard where when you guys celebrated one of your biggest milestones, you bought the cheapest champagne and plastic flutes, and I think the founders brought that to everyone. Could you just talk about what makes DoorDash's culture so interesting and unique? And maybe if there's a story of just a microcosm of what DoorDash culture is like, that'd be awesome to hear.

Keith Yandell (07:07):
Founder-led companies tend to take on the personality of their founders. And if you spend any time with our founder, Tony Xu, you realize that he's a humble leader. He's competitive. He really wants to win, and he'll do whatever it takes to win. And the example you're referring to, I think, is when we raised our Series D funding, which was a really tough fundraise for us... We had very little runway left. We almost went out of business, and it was a huge relief when we had finally gotten the funding secured.

Keith Yandell (07:40):
And I remember I was in a meeting. I was running policy and communications, among other things, at the time, and I was in the meeting with a couple other folks, and we were talking about the press release strategy. Tony was there. And someone ran down and got some, I think it was Korbel or something champagne and some plastic flutes. And one of the women who was in the meeting with me was going to leave to go put those together. This is a very smart woman, who I think Tony recognized could add more value. And he said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. You stay here. I'm going to go put together the champagne flutes." And he called the other two co-founders, Andy Fang and Stanley Tang. They came, stayed up all night, put together... I don't know... 500 champagne flutes, plastic ones, for this cheap champagne and let the people who are closest to the problem try to work out the comms piece. And I do think that's one great example of the culture.

Keith Yandell (08:31):
The other thing I think that really exemplifies DoorDash's culture is a level of customer obsession. And that manifests in a few different ways. We have a program called WeDash, where, four times, a year all employees are required to go do deliveries. And I love doing it. I do it more than four times a year, and I usually take my daughters with me. And one time, I was out with my daughter, who was eight at the time. We got a delivery, and it was not the best delivery. There's clearly something wrong with the system. We got a sandwich and a coffee, and we're supposed to drive 18 and a half miles to drop it off. And that didn't make sense for the customer. It didn't make sense for us as drivers.

Keith Yandell (09:13):
And she'd gotten to know Tony over the years, and she said, "I really want to call Tony and tell him this thing's broken." "Honey, I like my job. I'd like to keep my job. Can we not call Tony right now?" But she was adamant, and I was so proud of her for feeling so strongly that she wanted to fix this thing that was broken. I figured, "He's not going to answer anyway. We can just call." So call. Tony picks up on the first ring. And I'm like, "Oh, this might go badly." And she just lays into him. She said, "This is going to take us 36 minutes to drop off. The coffee's not going to be hot. How could you allow this experience if you really care about your customers?"

Lenny (09:52):
Whoa.

Keith Yandell (09:52):
And I kind of sucked in my breath and said, "Well, that's how my time at DoorDash ended." But Tony was great. He was like, "Hey, Alice, we have people who do deliveries for months. We have people who deliveries for years, and they're always providing me feedback. And this is one of the most insightful pieces of feedback I've gotten recently. And you've only been dashing for a few different times." And by the time we got home, he'd actually sent an email out to the product organization, calling out the problem, suggesting the fix. And they were already working on it. And that shows the bias to action that I think really is at the heart of DoorDash, alongside that customer obsession. And it's not unusual for Tony to do customer support. It wasn't like just because he heard this from my daughter that he actioned it. He does support every day. And again, this goes back to that level of humility and companies really taking on the ethos of their founder.

Lenny (10:47):
What an awesome story. I want to chat a bit more about the, what is it called? WeDash? Is that the program?

Keith Yandell (10:52):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny (10:52):
So you say that you're supposed to do it how many times a year, four times a year?

Keith Yandell (10:55):
Yeah, at least four times a year.

Lenny (10:56):
And then you said that you do it a lot more often. How often are you doing it? And then, is there any other fun stories of that experience, someone like you delivering someone's sandwich?

Keith Yandell (11:05):
I probably do it once a month.

Lenny (11:06):
Wow.

Keith Yandell (11:07):
And there, there's all kinds of great WeDash stories, but I don't know how interesting they're going to be to the broader public because, for me, it's just about getting out and experiencing the product. I almost always find something that's broken, and I send an email to... We have a Slack channel that's devoted to experiences via WeDash. It's everything from, I found a bug once where it wasn't routing you necessarily the fastest route. It was going using straight line as opposed to road. That was something that we fixed. And for me, the best parts about WeDash are the experiences, the interactions with the restaurants, the interactions with colleagues. So I'll go delivering with Ryan Sokol, the head of engineering. I'll give him a hard time about refining the product and things like that. But that's, by far, my favorite WeDash story, is the one with my daughter.

Lenny (11:57):
That's a good one. So at Airbnb, we actually had a similar program, where Brian wanted everyone to be a host on Airbnb. But as you can imagine, that's much harder. Not everyone is able to. Not everyone has a place to. So it's always kind of a challenge to make people do that. I imagine DoorDash is a lot easier because a lot of people can go around and deliver things. But yeah, such a killer idea, such a good way of dogfooding your product.

Keith Yandell (12:19):
Yeah, it's a good point, but not everyone is able, for a host of reasons, at DoorDash to do it. And so there are alternatives. So you can do customer support, for example, in lieu of actually going and doing deliveries. It's just about making people have empathy and get closer to the product. It's also, going back to the culture point you raise, it's a great way to weed out people that maybe we wouldn't want to work with, right, because not every software engineer wants to hop in their Tesla and go out and deliver McDonald's to some kids. Right? It takes a certain level of humility, a certain amount of customer obsession, to even sign up for that. So we're really vocal during the interview process that this is something that's expected. And it serves as a governor to attract the people that we think are going to be most successful at the company.

Lenny (13:02):
I love that. Imagine all your programs have the Dash in there somewhere. Something Dash.

Keith Yandell (13:07):
We try. I think when I was head of a marketing, we did a much worse job. I think we're doing much better now.

Lenny (13:13):
Nice. And Airbnb, it was always Air Something. Okay. So, I think one of the most interesting things about you and your background, and maybe unusual things, is the number of teams that you've led over your time at DoorDash. I have a list here. So over your time at DoorDash, you've led the HR team. You've led the customer support team, led the sales team, the marketing team. Now you lead the BD and corp dev team. Initially, I think, you were chief legal officer. So here's my question. As someone that, I imagine, doesn't have a ton of expertise and experience in a lot of these areas, how are you able to credibly lead these teams? And I ask partly because as a founder, you have to learn how to lead teams and people that you don't actually know what they're doing as well as they do. And so I'm just curious what you've learned about being able to lead teams in such disparate skill sets and functions.

Keith Yandell (14:03):
Yeah, the one thing I'll say is, I did not run sales. That's maybe one of the very few non-technical functions I did not lead. But the question is a good one. And I had massive imposter syndrome the first time Tony asked me to take on something that I wasn't a subject matter expert in. And I told him I didn't want to do it. And he had me read this book called Range by David Epstein. And the general thesis is that generalists are better than specialists. And it goes through all these examples of about how Nobel Prize winners are usually amazing in something other than the field that they actually win the Nobel Prize in.

Keith Yandell (14:38):
And Tony believes pretty deeply in this philosophy, and the way he explained it to me is as follows. If you want to achieve a 10x outcome, hiring someone that's an expert in the field, it's maybe unlikely you're going to achieve that 10x outcome, because they're likely to do things the way things have always been done. So you might achieve incremental benefits, but the odds of completely reinventing the system and doing something that's vastly superior to others is much lower. And he said, "I know you don't know how to do this stuff. That's why I'm putting you in the role." And I said, "Okay."

Keith Yandell (15:10):
So, first thing he helped me do was believe that I could add value here. And then, the second thing for me was to go out and find the best people that really were the subject matter experts, and add the value I could to help them be successful. And I found that they were actually really attracted to wanting to work with someone like me, who came into the interview process and said, "Good news, bad news. I don't know your field anywhere near as well as you do. Here's the ways I intend to help you. Here's what I think you can provide. And at the end of the day, I'm going to get out of your way." And that's really proven true. So, I ran marketing. Hired initially a head of brand, Kofi, who now is our CMO. Hired ahead of legal, who's now our GC, Tia Sherringham. And these people have really just excelled at their function and, with the warmup that I was able to provide, have really proven that they're much better at the jobs than I was.

Lenny (16:08):
You don't strike me as someone that is trying to build empires and take over all these teams. I imagine this kind of came at you because you've been doing a great job at other things. Is that how it worked? And, I guess, is there anything, any lessons there that you can take away?

Keith Yandell (16:21):
Yeah, hundred percent. I run a 12-person org today. So I've gone from running 1,500 people in the company to 12. And for me, people talk a lot about hiring people better than you are. People don't talk a lot about what you do when you hire those people. And if you really care about the company and your long-term brand as an individual, as a manager, you realize what you want to do when you find the person that's better than you is you want to slowly get out of the way. And it's really good for the company. It's my favorite part of my job, is seeing people that either I've hired or managed be successful on their own.

Keith Yandell (17:02):
And I think it's a big part of our success, is this desire to be successful, regardless of who's in charge. And that comes from the fact when I joined DoorDash, we were getting our tails kicked. We were in fourth place in the space. Uber had just launched food and rocket to market share leadership. And I think that was really good for us as a company because we realized unless we all worked together, and it wasn't about who was doing what or things like that, we weren't going to have a shot at being successful. And I think that ethos has really pervaded and persisted since then.

Lenny (17:40):
Yeah. I think most people don't realize DoorDash actually has the biggest market share in food delivery. Imagine that's still true. I've always seen these line charts of market share, and DoorDash is always the top. And I think people kind of think Uber Eats is winning, but it's not true.

Keith Yandell (17:52):
Yeah, I mean, the category charts I've seen are consistent with what you said by a pretty wide margin. But we try not to focus on things like that. We try to focus on the customer experience. And it's humbling in our space because we're doing millions and millions and millions of deliveries a day, and those deliveries will go wrong, no matter how hard you try. And we read those experiences. We do customer support, and we understand that there's a long ways to go. So we're just getting started, and we know that.

Lenny (18:21):
You mentioned that you ran this 1,500-person org at one point, and something that I've heard you do, that helps you do that, is you have this document that you put together that kind of explains how to work with Keith, and also, just broadly, how things work at DoorDash. Can you talk about this document, and why you thought it was necessary, and kind of the impact something like this has had? And then we're going to share a link to a redacted version of this in the show notes.

Keith Yandell (18:45):
One thing I've learned is it's super hard to scale culture, especially when you're growing as fast as DoorDash has since I joined. We were two or three X'ing the company, from a head count perspective, for the vast majority of my time every year. And so one thing I noticed is, it's hard to come into a place and be new and understand how things work and what it means to be successful there. And so the idea was to do our best to scale that. And one thing that Tony taught me is one thing that scales really well is written work [inaudible 00:19:16]. And so I put together this document. There's three basic subject matters. It's my expectations slash what I've seen as traits in successful people within the company.

Keith Yandell (19:28):
Two are how I can improve, like basically, feedback I've gotten in things I'm working on. For example, I'm a litigator by training, and so I tend to argue about things, even if I agree with people to the test levels of conviction. And I got feedback from my team that was really confusing because I'd be arguing against something, and then we would execute that exact thing. And so I try to be transparent about that and explain how I work through problems, but also in saying, "Hey, this is something I'm trying to improve on, is not being quite so argumentative for sport." And then it talks about what my commitments are to team. So, "I'm committed to finding you your next job even if that's not at DoorDash. Life's too short to be in a job you don't like," things like that.

Lenny (20:16):
I've heard from a few people how impactful this document ended up being. I guess, what impact have you seen this have on the org that you've run in the company and then, yeah, any other examples of just why this is powerful? Because I imagine some people listening are like, "Oh, I should do something like this."

Keith Yandell (20:32):
Yeah, I mean, for me, one of an executive's main jobs is to attract and retain top talent. And going back to why people have joined DoorDash, Kofi Amoo-Gottfried, who's now our CMO, joined me as head of brand when I was running marketing. And it's comical because this person is a legend in the marketing space, and I had no idea what was going on. And so convincing him to join, I was really nervous about. And the point where he decided to join, I had sent him this document. He wanted to know what it was like to work with me. I said, "Well, I've actually written that down."

Keith Yandell (21:01):
And he later told me that that was a really important factor for him, that someone was so transparent about their areas for growth, how they thought they could be helpful, and he liked the fact that I knew that I didn't know. And so he knew he was going to have a lot of autonomy on the role, and that was really important to him. But more broadly within the organization, how it's been helpful is just being able to have people engage with me in a way, and with the company in a way that is so consistent with the culture from day one. I've had people come and tell me, that I'd never met before, that they'd read the doc, even if they're on a different team, and just how helpful it's been to try to acclimate to this fast-paced environment, where you're learning while drinking from the fire hose, effectively.

Lenny (21:44):
Yeah, that makes sense. Touching a little bit on it, you talked about all these amazing people you've led and how you've been able to do that. Something else I've heard that you do that's pretty unusual is you help people that you manage find their next job, which may not necessarily be within the company, maybe at another company. You kind of help them land it and find something else to do. I've never heard of that before, really. I'd love to hear why you decided to do that, how you do that, and just the kind of impact, second-order impact, maybe, that has, maybe that leads you to be doing this.

Keith Yandell (22:15):
It wasn't a calculated decision why I started doing it. Then I gave it a lot of thought because I was afraid that I might get some blowback when people started taking jobs elsewhere. And as I thought about it, I realized it really is better for the company to have that type of open dialogue with people that work on your team. I think that's true for a few reasons. In this "How to work with Keith" document, I say, "I will help you find your next job." And what that means is, number one, people are going to be transparent with you, or more transparent, if they're looking for something else or if they're not happy. That's going to allow you to lay the foundation for a backfill so you're much less likely to get surprised when someone leaves.

Keith Yandell (22:59):
Number two, what's going to happen is if someone runs a blind reference on me at this point with someone that I've managed, which in the current environment is more and more common, people diligencing the managers, what they're going to hear is, "Keith's going to put you first." And I think that's really motivating for a lot of people. So if you're thinking on a five-, 10-year horizon of your career as a manager, whether you're an entrepreneur hiring people into your company, whether you're a product manager who's trying to build a team, building that long-term reputation, I think people take much too shortsighted perspective on that.

Keith Yandell (23:34):
And so now if I get a blind reference, people are going to hear that, "It's not all about the company. It's not all about Keith. It's about you and your career," and that's going to pay back 10x. Maybe you lose one really talented person, but they probably shouldn't be there anyway. They're probably going to leave anyway. And this way, you can participate in that and really drive value for them, as well as for the company in the future, by creating a much better reputation for the group of managers. So it's been really helpful for me. I keep in touch with a lot of people who have left, and we get a lot of boomerangs, too. There's a lot of people who leave DoorDash and come back. And that's something I love seeing because it shows that people have gone out and seen what else is out there and realized this is the right place for them.

Lenny (24:20):
Can you talk a bit about how you operationalize this? Because this is just out there. "Tell me if you're thinking about a new job, and I will talk to you through your options and help you find something." Or is there anything else there for folks that maybe want to offer this to their employees?

Keith Yandell (24:33):
So, first of all, I put it in this document. And so I say how I run one-on-ones in my "how to work with Keith" document, and the last 10 minutes of my one-on-ones are career development conversations. That's a really fertile ground for having the discussion. But for particularly more senior folks, if I get pinged for a GC job, or when I would get pinged by a recruiter for a GC job, I would forward that to Tia Sherringham, who's now our general counsel but was basically head of legal for years before she got the general counsel title. And I'd say, "Hey, Tia, I don't know when this job's going to be available here. I'm still liking what I'm doing. I think I'm still adding value. If you think it's time for you to leave, I think this is a really good opportunity."

Lenny (25:11):
Wow, that's [inaudible 00:25:12].

Keith Yandell (25:11):
And I say, in addition to that, "You're going to learn the questions they asked during the interview process. You're going to learn what type of qualifications they're looking for. And if I'm not getting you that experience, you can tell me." And thankfully for me, Tia decided to stay and has now grown into the general counsel of DoorDash, and doing a much better job at the role than I ever did. But she had the opportunity to leave, and I think she learned from some of those in-bounds and the experiences she had.

Lenny (25:40):
Wow. That's amazing, that your bosses forward you recruiter pitches to go work somewhere else.

Keith Yandell (25:48):
Think it made her want to stay. Right? If I wasn't invested in her success, she could have left any time and gotten a job, super qualified. But I think she felt a sense of loyalty based on my sense of loyalty, and I think it worked out best for all involved.

Lenny (26:04):
I love it. This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. And within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the road map, their OKR process, getting internal feedback. And essentially, their whole product development process is done within Coda.

Lenny (26:44):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location, regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special, limited time offer just for start-ups.

Lenny (27:23):
Something else I hear about you, which I'm sensing as we chat more and more, and I could see why this is true, is that on the DoorDash kind of C-suite and board meeting and board in general, you play this really strong unifying force that helps the group come to fast decisions on really complicated topics. And I'm curious. One, would you agree with that? And two, what is it that you do that helps a lot of strongly opinionated people come to decisions on really complicated decisions?

Keith Yandell (27:51):
I hope that's true. I think that, for me, it all comes down to empathy. And what I mean by that is, you have to understand what different people's motivations are in the room. Different people are goaled on different things. People come from different life experiences and different work experiences. And I think it's really important to make each person feel heard. We had a situation, for example, where we were deciding between a trade-off between two business lines. It was a profitability question for one business line, to make one business line much more profitable to do a certain partnership, but it would come at the expense of the growth of another business line that was more nascent.

Keith Yandell (28:30):
And so it's hard when you get the GMs for all these businesses together, and they have very strong perspectives and good reasons on both sides about why path A is better profitability, path B is better for growth. And they're arguing very strenuously, in part because they want to hit their numbers, in part because they believe it. One thing I found super effective in those contexts is I try to ask the other side. So, let's take the profitability side. I ask them to make the growth case. I say, "Tell me the three best reasons why we should actually focus on growth here." That generates instant empathy for the other side. And sometimes, they'll even persuade themselves as they're talking and say, "I think you're right that we should focus on growth here. We can achieve this profitability measure later" or vice versa. And so generating empathy and having empathy for the other side, understanding how they're goaled and what they're bringing to the conversation, I think is the first step to having those really tough conversations.

Lenny (29:25):
I love that. What other steps are there? I like that as a first step. Is there anything else you have that you end up finding is really helpful there?

Keith Yandell (29:32):
Sometimes these conversations can go on forever. Right? People just want to keep going back to an argument they've already made, because they're not willing to settle, and there needs to be someone that says, "All right. We got to be clear on who the decision maker is here. If we haven't reached a consensus, who's the tiebreaker?" And a lot of time that's our CEO, Tony Xu, but a lot of times it's the GM for a certain business line or a head of product or a head of engineering, depending on the decision to be made. I think being really clear about, "Hey, we're all going to come together. We're going to have a healthy debate. We're going to make sure everyone's perspectives are heard. We're going to try to reach consensus, but the end of the day, here's the person that's going to make the decision, and we're going to make it on this time horizon. And once the decision is made, we're going to [inaudible 00:30:16]."

Keith Yandell (30:17):
And I think that having someone that's in the room that has run a lot of the functions that are trying to articulate the perspective is helpful, and someone who's been at the company as long as I have and given up as much as I have... Right? To your point earlier, everyone knows I'm not trying to build an empire. I'm trying to find a way to win. And I think it gives me some credibility to call the question, figure out who decision maker is, set a time line, and move on. The only way it works is if there's empathy on both sides.

Lenny (30:46):
This is great, so I just took a few notes. One is there's essentially the steel man component. Have them steel man the other side, argue why that's the better decision. Clarify a decision maker. Make it clear like, "There's the tiebreaker. If we can't get there, this person's going to make the decision." And then create a time horizon of like, "We need to make a decision by this time." Is there anything else, before we move on to a different question?

Keith Yandell (31:08):
I think that's the right framework. I can tell you're product guy. You're very good at distilling it down to the essence. I think that's a good summary.

Lenny (31:16):
Yeah, you got to do it. You mentioned the one-on-one meetings. And I took a note on this, actually, and I wanted to come back to it. You mentioned at the end of your one-on-one meetings you have this kind of coaching career conversation. Is there anything else you could share about just your approach to one-on-one meetings, your agenda or how you think about one-on-ones?

Keith Yandell (31:32):
This is super tactical. It's something I think is really important, is I'm very clear, in the document we talked about earlier, about how I like to work, is I demand feedback for me. And so we set aside time during one-on-ones where I want the feedback. First, constructive feedback. And I expect it, and if you don't give it to me, I'm going to press you on constructive feedback. And then I give feedback. I tell this to managers all the time. If you create a space where you require constructive feedback, it's a lot easier to give feedback. One of the top things I hear from managers, especially new managers, they don't like giving constructive feedback. They want to be positive. They want to be liked and things like that. And so it's a nice way to create space to have that dialogue.

Keith Yandell (32:15):
And that's something I actually learned from Travis, when I was at Uber. We had a system called T3 B3, where during reviews or pulse check-ins, you'd have to say three positives about your manager and three constructive pieces of feedback for your manager. And the first time I did it, I just did the T, the tough things, for my manager, who was the general counsel at the time. And Travis came over, and, "This is totally unacceptable. You have to provide constructive feedback," which made me super uncomfortable but created the right environment, where people could have these tough conversations because, "My manager can't get mad at me, because she knows the CEO's going to come give me a hard time if I don't provide some constructive feedback." And I think having that as an expectation is super important to building open lines of communication.

Lenny (33:05):
Wow. I like this T3 B3. So T is top good things and B is three bad things.

Keith Yandell (33:10):
Yeah.

Lenny (33:11):
Cool. I'm trying to imagine you in this meeting with the CMO you mentioned, and them having to give you constructive feedback. That's always hard, even though you expect it. Is there anything else you do to help people feel comfortable giving you hard feedback in meetings like that?

Keith Yandell (33:26):
You have to thank them for it. Right? I mean, there's a saying, "Feedback is a gift," but you have to say stuff, and you have to action. And that's one thing I've found that can be really demotivating for folks. A lot of these companies have these pulse surveys, or they talk about what the company can do better, and they put the results on the screen, and, "We're going to work on it," and that's the end of it.

Keith Yandell (33:50):
And that was something I learned early on at DoorDash that people didn't like, unless you were going to come back and say, "Hey, this was our lowest performing area in the pulse survey. Here are the three things we did to action it," because that's how you would treat the business. Right? If we got feedback from a customer or from another business line, you would say, "Heard it. We're going to come back and report out on what we're going to do differently, and then we're going to track the progress." And so I think that's really important when you receive feedback. You have to show people that you're actioning it and say, "I heard this from you. Checking in. Am I doing better? Here are the things that I've changed." And so making sure that there's that feedback loop, I think, is another important part of creating the right structure for a good, healthy culture.

Lenny (34:33):
Another guest on the podcast had the same exact advice for getting feedback, and the way he described it is you want to be enthusiastic about like, "Thank you so much for that." And the way he described it is even though you're melting inside because you don't want to hear, "Thank you so much. That was so helpful."

Keith Yandell (34:48):
It's really good advice.

Lenny (34:49):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about the DoorDash kind of journey. There's been a lot of high highs with DoorDash. There's been some low lows. I know that there was a funding round at one point, where it was very precarious and may not have worked out. Question I have for you around that is just, leading through hardships and through tough times, what have you learned, as a leader, about how to lead through challenging times? And ask partly because a lot of companies are going through that right now. It's pretty hard for a lot of folks out there, a lot of layoffs. And so yeah, I'm curious what you've learned about leading through challenging times.

Keith Yandell (35:23):
Yeah. I'm going to regurgitate some advice I got from some folks on our board at the same time, when we were having really tough times, which I really didn't like hearing at the time, but I was kind of new to the space. And that is, "Tough times make companies," for a host of reasons. I mean, this is super healthy for the start-ups out there right now. It's because, number one, you're going to find out who the mercenaries are on the team, that are people that are there for the mission, versus they're there because they think this is going to be a quick road to riches. We had a lot of people leave the company when Uber launched food, and we fell quickly behind. And that was good for us because the people that stayed were there because they wanted to work on this team, on this mission, and they really believed in it.

Keith Yandell (36:11):
The second thing is it forces discipline. It's a good thing to focus on unit economics. And we didn't have the funding that a lot of our competitors did, which forced us to be super focused on our unit economics and efficient and serve the customer in unique ways from the start. And I think a lot of our success, even to this day, emanates from those tough times. The last thing I'll say is if you're a founder, and you're looking for talent, tough times are great because there's a lot more talent out there. I saw... I think it might have been Bill Gurley. Someone tweeted, "This is the best time in recent memory, since 2008, to start a company." And that really resonated with me because there's a lot of talented folks out there who are looking for their next thing. And three years ago, it was tough to find talent. And so I think there's a lot to like about tough times.

Keith Yandell (36:59):
The last thing I'll say is, one thing that I found surprising is, from our surveys internally, people actually like crises at DoorDash. And I dug into that recently, and I was trying to figure out [inaudible 00:37:10] like these crises, and it's because there's singularity of focus. You know what the job is. You know you're going to get whatever resources the company has, when you're focused on the main thing. And these tough economic times will create that work. It's crystal clear. You got to cut, burn, and everyone's going to be doing what they need to do to achieve that outcome. And I think talented folks really like that, one, resourcing, and two, singularity of focus about what the main thing is. And crises manifests those for folks.

Lenny (37:42):
It's interesting that there's all these benefits to tough times. It's hard to recreate artificially. Reminds me a little bit of Frank Slootman, I think his name... and his book Amp It Up, where he talks a lot about the importance of urgency, always creating urgency. And obviously, a downturn like we have today is an urgent situation. Have you found that to be true, the power of creating urgency? And then, is there something you've learned about how to create that urgency at a company [inaudible 00:38:07]?

Keith Yandell (38:07):
Yeah, this is something Tony's talked about since the day I joined, and he's very good at, frustratingly good, at that, because just when you think you've achieved the goal, the goal might go up. It might get shorter if you're from the product side. And speaking specifically on the product, compound interest is a really hard concept to fully explain to people, to make them truly appreciate. But that's something Tony is fantastic at, which is, he understands that by pushing a road map up, even by a week, if you can continuously push up what you ship by a week, you're going to end up lapping competitors who are just one week behind because you're going to start the next thing a week sooner, and you're getting that 1.1, 1.01x return. And then it grows and grows and grows.

Keith Yandell (38:51):
And he's as good as I've ever seen, combined with our president, Christopher Payne, at creating that sense of urgency and just pushing people. "Do we really need to test this thing again or can we ship it? How can we move that much faster?" Even if it's by a small margin, understanding that you can compound those gains over time has been really impactful for our success.

Lenny (39:11):
I saw the same thing at Airbnb. It feels like, "Things are going well. Maybe we could take a little break," but it's constant just like, "How do we go faster? How do we go bigger? Okay, what's next? We launched this thing. Let's move on." And it feels like such a pattern across companies that do really well, is the founders continuing to keep that pressure on.

Keith Yandell (39:28):
I remember our IPO day. We had this thing. I had to wake up super early. It was a virtual bell ringing, and the second it was over, we had our weekly business review, and there were tough questions being asked. There was not champagne being passed around. I mean, people were in a good mood, but it wasn't like, "Wow, this is so great." It's just like, "Hey, how are we going to serve our customers today?" And I thought that was really emblematic of, "Hey, if we take too deep of a breath and are patting ourselves on the back..." It reminds me of the saying, "Somewhere, someone out there is practicing, and when you meet them, they will beat you." It's the same kind of thing. It's if you take too long to be self-congratulatory, you're going to fall behind the people who are still hungry. So it's important to stay hungry.

Lenny (40:12):
Wow. Reminds me, I think it's Bill Gates talking about someone's in a garage building the next Microsoft, and he's always trying to stay ahead of them.

Keith Yandell (40:18):
So true.

Lenny (40:20):
The other thing this makes me think about is just, it's wild that founders... like Airbnb founders have been at this 15 years. Tony, I'm not exactly sure. We're probably a similar amount of time. It's just like they have to keep that pressure on within the company and also keep themselves motivated and excited and continuing to push. Just such a hard path. There's benefits to being that founder, but it's such a challenging life, too.

Keith Yandell (40:42):
Yeah, I think it can be lonely to be a founder, for sure. I know that Tony's tried to develop a community, for him, of people who are similarly situated from other companies, and that's been helpful. And the real founders that I've come across, that drive, though, is something they can't turn off. They don't have to try to keep it, because there's a handful of traits I've seen that are pretty common. One is a level of obsessiveness. Two is hypercompetitiveness. And I think they're good at manufacturing straw men, even if everyone's saying nice things. It's like Michael Jordan used to take things out of context and make bulletin board material. There's definitely an element of that in the great founders that I've come across. And there's just a raw curiosity. So it's the competitiveness, but the curiosity in learning how things are working, and those all come together to create a drive that just never stops.

Lenny (41:33):
That resonates. Coming back to the DoorDash journey a little bit, I imagine the pandemic was kind of this microcosm of high highs and low lows, where, as an external observer, felt like everyone needed DoorDash immediately, and it was just probably the best thing for your business. On the other hand, I imagine you had to scale like crazy and keep the wheels on the bus through this time. Can you just talk about that part of history for DoorDash?

Keith Yandell (41:55):
I mean, it was just a wild rollercoaster. We were trying to get ready to go public, first of all, and so there was that overlay. And then, what you saw was our volume dropped right away, like the first or second day of lockdown. And I was like, "Well, this is going out of business because no one wants to order food from restaurants anymore." People didn't know how COVID was transmitted. And so just basically volume dropped out a cliff. And I was like, "Oh, went from a super high. We're getting ready to IPO. Super low. Volume's going to zero." And then, all of a sudden, volume doubled. And that was really exciting for a second, till we realized that our customer support center... I was running support at the time. All the support centers around the world shut down. So you're doubling volume. You have no one to serve it, from a customer support perspective.

Keith Yandell (42:39):
And our infrastructure, we weren't planning to grow that fast. We didn't think there was a chance of two or three exiting in a very short window. And so every Friday night, the app would crash. And if you're running customer support, there's few things you like less than the app going down. Set aside what it means for the customers and for the business. Selfishly, it's just super painful. The irony of it was, is our NPS was going up and that people were just so grateful to have the product, to be able to safely get the things they needed, for people to be able to earn money at times when they really needed it because maybe their job had been shut down, or they weren't allowed to go in. It became a really essential service for folks. And that was really motivating for me, and I think for the team, is to really be able to fulfill the big part of our mission of empowering local economies in a very unique way in a very special time.

Keith Yandell (43:30):
And the last thing I'll say on the pandemic was, one of my most vivid DoorDash memories was being on a Zoom call, where we were trying to figure out what to do to help restaurants. And again, we were trying to go public. And Tony made a decision, and I admit, I'm on the wrong set of history. I was arguing that this seemed extreme, just to cut commissions by basically 100 million bucks for restaurants, to help them stay in business. And I'm like, "Hold on. We're trying to go public. This is going to completely change the bottom line perspective. No one's asking us to do this."

Keith Yandell (44:06):
And Tony says, "Keith, you think too short-term." He's like, "This is the right thing to do." And reminded me of the Ted Lasso quote, which is, "Doing the right thing is never the wrong thing." And talk about how sometimes there's healthy debate. He didn't want to hear any debate on this one. He said, "Just shut it down." And he's like, "Founder-led decision. This is the right thing to do. We're going to cut these commissions." And I woke up the next morning and never been happier to kind of been overruled in a debate before than there. It was just such a meaningful moment for the company, and I was so proud to be a part of the organization.

Lenny (44:40):
Is there anything else you took away from that experience of just living through this up and down of pandemic times at DoorDash?

Keith Yandell (44:48):
It actually reminds me of the best advice I got when we were having our first kid. And everyone thinks they're going to give you the insight that's really going to be transformative. But one that stuck with me is, "For better and for worse, everything's temporary. So the highs, you can't get too high. The lows, you can't get too low." That really resonated with me during that period of time, as well as this general idea that you have to try to find opportunities to reach the potential for the business. And decisions sometimes have to be made in very short time horizons, and being able to seize those moments, I think, is really important.

Lenny (45:24):
I have a few questions about product that I want to get to. But one bigger question about DoorDash is, you've been involved in a lot of the bigger fundraising moments, DoorDash. I think you've worked probably with every major firm out there, raised large dollar amounts for DoorDash. Are there any memories or lessons that you can share from that experience?

Keith Yandell (45:44):
We've definitely tried to raise from everyone, been told no many, many times. I mean, raising the Series D was really difficult. Tony and I worked together very closely on that one. And there was a lull in the tech market publicly, and it translated pretty quickly to the private markets. And people didn't believe in either the TAM or the profitability of the business model. And it was difficult. I think one thing that process taught me is after we raised the D, almost every round, or I think every round ended up being led by someone who had passed in a previous round. And that was because we put up numbers we were highly confident we were going to hit.

Keith Yandell (46:25):
I'm an operating partner at a venture firm on the side, and I see that most people put up stretch plans, but they [inaudible 00:46:31]. But that was just not in our DNA. We wanted to make sure that we put forth numbers that we knew were going to hit, and that cost us some dilution upfront in the form of lower valuations, I think. And there's just a trust that builds from that, where when we tell people we're going to do something, that they have conviction that we're going to do it. And I would trade a couple of points of dilution for that level of trust with the right investor base over time.

Lenny (46:58):
For founders that are going through fundraising right now, maybe having a hard time, any just advice from that period for founders, yeah, that are having a hard time raising these days?

Keith Yandell (47:08):
It's fortunate because you only need one yes. Right? And you see all the people post the how many rejections they got. Every business that you have heard of has gotten rejected by at least a handful of venture capitalists at one point or another. And so that drive to keep going, if you believe in the business, is critical, absolutely critical. I mean, we were weeks of runway situation and had been told no by everyone, and it was just Tony's drive, really, to keep going. And the way he explains it to me is it's just the difference between a founder and a non-founder. If you're really a founder, you just have to find a way. You have to keep going. There's no question. And I mean, that's the only advice I can give folks, is it only takes one yes. But you got to keep going.

Lenny (48:00):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit to a few product questions. Most listeners to this podcast are product builders, growth people, founders, and so I have a couple questions here. Today you're currently leading the corp dev and BD team, and I imagine you work closely with the product team. And so I'm curious what you've found to be an effective relationship between BD and product and from the experience you've had at DoorDash doing that.

Keith Yandell (48:26):
Yeah, I joke that our head of product, Rajat Shroff, is actually the head of BD, because he's both interested and good at it. And to do impactful BD, the two really have to go hand-in-glove. So when I think through how to make that relationship work, the first challenge I've confronted, and maybe mistake I made, is trying to figure out what the right cadence is. When do you bring in the product team? Because if you bring them in too early on a deal that really has no chance of getting done, you waste valuable cycles. And our tech talent is our most precious resource, probably, at DoorDash. And so you have to be really mindful about when you bring them in. But if you bring them in too late, it may be a situation where you've given on terms that you really shouldn't have, and that can be really detrimental to the partnership as well.

Keith Yandell (49:17):
So I think one thing to do is just give visibility. So without actually bringing them and having a full discussion, like, "Here's the pipeline. If you see things that are super impactful, let us know. If you think things you're not so sure that are going to make a difference, please let us know." That's been really helpful.

Keith Yandell (49:32):
Another thing that Rajat's taught me is the importance of building platforms, and whenever you can. So what we used to do is, I'd go out and negotiate a deal. We had a lot of deals around DashPass, which is our subscription product, and I'd ask the product team to go build a bespoke thing for this particular partnership, Chase or whatever partnership we were negotiating at the time. And Rajat said, "Why don't you figure out what the scalable solution is for this? We will build you a product. You won't need to come ask us every time to build something. And then you'll know the parameters in which you can negotiate. You can negotiate a better velocity. We might spend more time on the first version of this, but very little effort for the next. And we'll have a high return on the product hours and the engineering hours spent." And so that was a super valuable insight that I garnered from him, is to try to figure out how to create these type of platforms.

Lenny (50:27):
Any other lessons of just building an effective BD team within a product company, especially at the scale you're at?

Keith Yandell (50:35):
A few other things. Number one... This is something else that Rajat taught me. One of our core values is, "Dream big, start small." And he really brought that to the BD product org. And there were some painful times. We invested heavily in a partnership with a hotel chain. We thought we were going to build, "Hey, we're going to make sure that this is the new dine-in experience when you're at a hotel. We can actually replace room service." And asked for a lot of product worked. And it was a total flop. And the realization I had is that we should have gone out and tested this at one hotel with just some hacky operations and seen what the uptick was. And what I would've realized is this particular hotel chain was franchised. So even though corporate thought this was an important thing they were going to prioritize, if the franchisee doesn't care about it, they're not going to give you the visibility, in room or otherwise, to make it work. So we built all this great integration [inaudible 00:51:32] that was totally wasted because the operations weren't right.

Keith Yandell (51:35):
And I have probably two or three other examples of situations where I learned I should have just gone out and stood out front with a promo code, and handed it out in certain forums, and seen if that changed customer behavior, before going and asking for the product resources. And Rajat correctly was like, "Hey, this is how we have to think about these things going forward." So yeah, definitely building platforms, "Dream big, starts small," use operations to test a thesis around a deal before you actually expend the product resources, I think has been super helpful. And then, the last thing would be to engage early, but not too early, on deal opportunities.

Lenny (52:12):
It's interesting how the advice of doing things that don't scale just continues to be useful, even at the scale of a DoorDash. Like you said, you could just stand out there and see if people want room service through DoorDash before building a whole solution.

Keith Yandell (52:24):
Yeah, early DoorDash, that was a core value. Do things that don't scale. It's as relevant today as it was then.

Lenny (52:31):
Same at Airbnb, is something the founders brought up all the time. And speaking of that, another area that you have a lot of expertise on is legal. So, you led legal for a while at DoorDash. And I was thinking, as thinking about this question, "I wonder what's more difficult, to be head of legal at Airbnb or head of legal at DoorDash," both fraught businesses and ideas. But we'll avoid that question for now. So my question is just legal and product. It's always this interesting relationship, how much legal has say over what happens versus how much product has final decision-making powers. Any lessons there about just how to set up a product and legal relationship within a software business?

Keith Yandell (53:12):
Yeah. And both for the product folks that are listening as well as the entrepreneurs who want to be founders, I've had the pleasure of working with two founders who are very product-driven, product-first folks, in Travis and Tony. And I've found that the way they engage on the legal side is with the curiosity I referenced earlier, which is they're both hyper curious, and they will ask questions until they understand the law in the particular area about as well as the lawyers. And then they will apply a first principles product mindset to their understanding of the law, and they will push the lawyers to make sure that they're not being overly conservative, which sometimes they can be.

Keith Yandell (53:51):
And so, when you're on the product team, especially if you're in a consumer-facing business, it may not be as pronounced for SaaS businesses, but if you're in a consumer-facing business, working on a consumer-facing product, you had better have at least a general understanding of what type of regulations are going to apply to your business, and what type of constraints there are, and how to push those constraints. Yeah, and so for me it's just about that level of curiosity and actually engaging in the profession. Right? There's nothing magic about the law. There's a finite number of things that you can learn. And just like all the other functions I've learned, I think you can engage them in a way, till you are proficient and actually really accretive to your business.

Lenny (54:31):
Keith, this has been incredible. I can see why people want to work for you, why they keep giving you more teams to run. I learned a ton. I'm really excited for folks to listen to this and learn from you. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, or if they want to reach out or learn more, where do you point them? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Keith Yandell (54:50):
If you want to find me, LinkedIn is the place you can locate me. You can locate me there. I don't do any other social media. It is maybe unusual in this day and age, but that's my preferred medium. And then, as far as being helpful, always looking for referrals for great people. That would be the number one thing. And everyone has an opportunity to use our product. So if you have product feedback, I always welcome that as well.

Lenny (55:16):
For folks that maybe want to join DoorDash after hearing this, is there specific roles you're hiring for? Anything you want to share there, folks that might be interested?

Keith Yandell (55:24):
Yeah, I mean, select roles definitely on the product and engineering side is a place we're focused right now. But even if there's not a role open today, I like meeting great people. I've found that building relationships over time, even when you're not looking, is impactful.

Lenny (55:37):
Awesome. Keith, thank you so much again for doing this.

Keith Yandell (55:40):
Thanks, Lenny.

# Why not asking for what you want is holding you back | Kenneth Berger (exec coach, first PM @Slack)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You were famously the first PM at Slack and then you ended up transitioning into executive coaching.

Kenneth Berger (00:00:05):
For me, the impact was about making this work sustainable so that we're not burning out or selling out, but actually able to pursue these hard goals that we have in startups.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
What we're going to be talking about today is your personal magnum opus, the output of 10 plus years as a founder and operator and seven plus years as a coach.

Kenneth Berger (00:00:23):
The core idea is ask for what you want. Turns out when you actually ask for what you want out loud, you're much more likely to get it.

Speaker 3 (00:00:30):
You're hired.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
How do you know that this is something you need to be working on?

Kenneth Berger (00:00:34):
If you're more in the people pleasing camp, maybe you're used to not asking at all. You're hoping that people are reading your mind. And if you're sort of more in the control freak camp, maybe you're used to ordering people around and saying, "Go do this now."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
How do you know what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:00:46):
Complaints are great inspiration. Every complaint implies a dream. Let me envision a better future. Let me think about what's an effective way to actually move towards that. See what it's like to not be sort of living in fear all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:01):
Today, my guest is Kenneth Berger. Kenneth coaches startup leaders to help them avoid burnout and live the life that they want. He was the first product manager at Slack and spent over 10 years in tech before transitioning into coaching. His core focus with leaders is to help them learn how to ask for what they want. This sounds really simple, but as you'll hear in our chat, this one skill is at the core of so many of the struggles that people have in their career and in their life.

(00:01:28):
Kenneth shares a ton of very tactical advice to help you figure out what it is you want, how to overcome the resistance that comes with asking for what you want, how to actually ask for what you want effectively, why the most important step is hearing the response that you get when you ask for what you want and all of the things that will change in your life if you get better at this one skill.

(00:01:50):
Kenneth also shares the story of him being fired three times from Slack, which is hilarious. With that, I bring you Kenneth Berger after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:04:20):
Kenneth, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Kenneth Berger (00:04:23):
Yay. thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:30):
I love that, yay. That should be a tradition that everyone goes with. I love that. So we originally met when I was doing a post on being a first product manager at a company. You were famously the first PM at Slack, and then you ended up transitioning into executive coaching, which is what you do now. What we're going to be talking about today is something that you described to me as, quote, your personal magnum opus, the output of 10 plus years as a founder and operator, and seven plus years as a coach to startup leaders.

(00:04:59):
And the core idea is simply asking for what you want, which sounds really simple. So let me just start broadly just why have you found that this skill, this one idea is so core to so many of the challenges that people run into in work and in life?

Kenneth Berger (00:05:19):
If I had to answer in one word, it would be integrity. I think that it's one of these funny things where everyone thinks they already know how to ask for what they want. We all ask for what we want. We order our coffee in the morning and we all think we have integrity. No one walks around thinking, "I'm lying to myself all the time or lying to others certainly." And yet we tend to fool ourselves a little bit. When it comes to are we really pursuing the things that we want in life? And I think to me, the flip side of that is sort of the reason that the stakes around asking for what you want are so high because we can't guarantee we're going to get what we want.

(00:05:59):
But if we're asking for it regularly, if we're listening to the response, we're expecting the nose we get from the world, then we can get the sense of, "Yeah, I'm honoring what's important to me. I'm honoring the world's response and I'm moving forward towards what I want." And if we don't do that, "Well, then we're fooling ourselves that we're actually moving towards of what we want." There tends to be all these unexpected secondary and tertiary effects that come out of that of stress and frustration, and unhappiness because of course, asking for what we want, pursuing what's important to us in life is just one of the most important things of fulfillment, of what's important in achieving our purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:37):
What are just some challenges that people have in their life and career that are just rooted in doing this badly? Not asking for what you want, not knowing what you want.

Kenneth Berger (00:06:47):
For me with clients, I think what I'm often looking for are just kind of this sense of being stuck because everybody has got frustrations. Everybody gets nervous at work sometimes. But if we're in the same stuck place week after week after week in our coaching sessions, probably you're trying the same thing and not getting any different results. It's that definition of insanity thing.

(00:07:11):
So really I look at that and say, "Okay. Maybe you're asking for what you want." Maybe. Although often people aren't. But even if you are, you're probably not achieving it. You're not getting the results that you want. So why are we not learning from that? Why are we not moving forward getting new data, trying something new, actually treating it as a sort of iterative development discovery process?

(00:07:32):
So I think that stuckness is one thing. And I think the other thing I look for is interpersonal conflict, right? Because I think that one mode of not asking for what you want well is holding back and not really saying it out loud. I think another really common mode is coming with a lot of entitlement of, "You know what? You better do what I say. I'm your boss. You're my report. You better obey or agree," or whatever it is. And of course the danger of that is interpersonal conflict. Even if you are their boss, that's a really disrespectful way to come into the conversation and it's an obvious source for a lot of issues.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:09):
Before we get into how to learn to do this better and more of why this is so important, is there an example from your career where you did this really badly or you didn't ask what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:08:19):
There's so many examples. I think we will eventually get into the story of how I was fired from Slack. But I think for me, the thing that always came up was just being attached to being right. And I think a lot of us get into this boat. We enter into a meeting and we're sure from the first moment, "I'm right and they're wrong." And I think that especially in product management, we're supposed to be the holders of this vision for what the product should be. And so it's easy to come in with a lot of conviction and not really a lot of openness to other ideas.

(00:08:51):
Often what I try to introduce people to, and I've learned all this stuff the hard way, believe me, is it's fundamentally disrespectful to go into a meeting already deciding that you're right and the other person is wrong because you can't know that for sure. There's always a new perspective, new data that could come in. And so you want that conversation to really be a back and forth. And if you're coming in with this really ingrained sense of righteousness, you can't do that. There's no way to have that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:17):
I think you may have already answered this question, but I think it's really important is how do you know that this is something you need to be working on? How do you know like, "I really need to pay attention to what Kenneth is about to tell me?" You said one is you feel you're stuck in your career, something you're just not making progress, and this could be the answer. Or you said there's interpersonal conflict and you're just having a lot of conflict with people. Are those the two answers? Are there more?

Kenneth Berger (00:09:37):
I think those are great things to look for. I think it's also good to look for a sense of things being high stakes, because I think part of what can create a lot of conflict and difficulty in these situations is a sense of this is life or death. And that was certainly how it was when I was a founder of, "Okay, normally..." When I was at Adobe, it's a big company, they're going to be fine either way, no matter what I do. Right? I can be easy going. Let someone else have their way in the meeting. But when it was my company, when it was my vision on the line, I didn't feel especially flexible. The stakes seemed really, really high.

(00:10:12):
This is the success of my idea, of my vision, my reputation is on the line. And so I think often when the stakes feel high, we're kind of focused more on the fear of what we don't want to happen than on actually achieving what we do want. And that's a really critical distinction because if we're running away from our fears, it doesn't necessarily mean we're getting anywhere meaningful for what our desires are. And so that sense of high stakes that often we can get, whether it's in interpersonal conflict or being afraid of asking for what we want, that can get us really focused on the fears rather than focused on the goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):
There's a question I was going to save for later, but it's something that's very top of mind for me is knowing what you want. How do you know what you want? There's basically knowing what you want and then asking for what you want. I like equanimity in my life, and so I often don't ask for what I want or push down maybe what I want, or I don't think about what I want. I just want other people to be happy.

(00:11:15):
I'm curious what people can do and what I can do to get better at knowing here's what actually want, here's what would make me happy and fulfilled? What are some skills there I could work on and other people can work on?

Kenneth Berger (00:11:27):
Well, first of all, I'd say you're very far from alone there. I mean, I think the people pleaser coping strategy is one of the sort of most classic, and it is effective, right? In the short term like, "Oh, you can feel safe and calm when other people are generally happy with you." And the cost tends to be long term in terms of am I really pursuing the things that are important to me?

(00:11:48):
So one of my favorite techniques here is this concept they call dream behind the complaint. Because you're right that we tend to not be that great always at really dreaming and envisioning and saying, "This is my dream of what I want out of life." That can sound really scary for people, but we're very good at complaining. Usually people are very good at saying, "Oh my God, there's this thing happening at work, it's so annoying. Or there's this person that really bothers me so much, why are they always like this?"

(00:12:17):
So the magic of that complaining is that every complaint implies a dream. It implies a better world where that complaint is resolved. And so often that's the tool that I'll take people to first to say, "All right, great. Let's complain. Right? It feels so fun and good and releasing to complain, and let's look at what that implied world is behind that complaint." What is this vision? And then to really check, "Okay. Let's imagine you get that. That's the world of the future that you get. How does that feel? Is that big enough or is it kind of meh?"

(00:12:50):
Are we like, "Oh, my dream is that I get to speak up a little more in meetings?" It's like, "Well, that's probably not a hundred percent of your dream. What's really behind that?" And so I think that check can help you sort of level up to say, "Is this really an inspiring dream for me that's going to motivate me more than those fears that might be hiding in the background?"

(00:13:13):
And on the flip side, with entitled people, you can also get really unrealistic dreams where I might say, "Okay. So it sounds like what I'm hearing is that your dream is that everyone obeys you and automatically agrees with you no matter what." And they sort of say, "Ah, I don't know if that's quite my dream." And so if your dream is so embarrassing to say out loud, you can't even really own it, maybe that's not the right dream. And so that checking whether it actually feels inspiring, but also sort of credible and possible is a good way to find that middle ground where, "Yeah, this dream is hard. I don't know that I'm going to get it, but, damn, it's worth trying. I want to go for it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:54):
I love that for someone that wants to try this on their own and help themselves get better at this without you being there, what is it that you do? Is it you dream about what would make you happiest? Is it complain and see what's at the root of it? Is it just imagine a world where you're really happy and see what emerges.

Kenneth Berger (00:14:11):
Specifically for articulating what you want because that's the first step of the asking for what you want process. It really is as simple as that of let's start with what you have consciously in terms of what you want. And if you have trouble, then we can try looking at complaints and starting to articulate a vision out of that.

(00:14:29):
But to me, really what's interesting about asking for what you want is that on the surface it's very simple, right? I mean, the steps I outline are articulate what you want, ask for what you want intentionally and accept the response and then try again. Because it's an iterative process. We're learning from the response and what it tells us because the response is usually no. So really what tends to be hard there, I mean, that's a straightforward process. It's not rocket science. What's hard there is the resistance.

(00:14:58):
The parts of us that are not so excited about that, that thinks asking for what we want is scary and articulating a big dream that we might not get is really scary. Because god, what if I don't get it? What does that mean about me? Am I a failure? Or what does it mean if I respect the no? What if I ask for my big dream and someone tells me I'm not going to get it? What does that mean? How am I going to feel?

(00:15:19):
So working through all that resistance is really a lot of what tends to be tricky about asking for what you want because otherwise it's articulate, ask, accept.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:28):
Okay. You're getting into where we're going to go. Before we get there. Final question. This idea of dealing with, no, I think this is the other big blocker for people is like, "Oh, that's so scary to ask for something I really want or ask for something big that is really important to you." What is it that you advise there of just getting over this fear of just asking for what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:15:49):
So I have a more expansive definition of no than most people, I think, because for me it's not a yes unless it's a hell yes. Because you really want enthusiastic consent. Not just, "Maybe, kinda. I'll try. We'll see. But yeah, absolutely, let's do this." And I think that often it's so tempting to settle for something less than that to say, "Oh, well, okay, we'll give that a try." And that often comes to bite us later on because we accept this thing that short of a hell yes. And then we realized later on, "Oh yeah, they weren't really in."

(00:16:26):
They didn't show up to the party or they didn't deliver on time because my CTO said, "Yeah, I think maybe we can deliver by May 1st." And then May 1st comes and surprise, surprise, your milestone is not done because you didn't go for that hell yes. And so I think part of what I encourage people to do is, one, to really hear anything short of a hell yes as a no. So it's not a bad thing. Mostly the world tells us it's actually really great data. It helps us figure out what are we going to try next? What are we going to try next, try next, try next? Because that's going to help us learn how to actually get to that hell yes.

(00:17:03):
And part of that asking process is of not settling for it, but actually asking and saying, "Hey, I'm hearing maybe you're lukewarm on May 1st as a date. What would be a hell yes day for you where you could say, absolutely, we can deliver on that?" And that way we're not making them wrong for saying no. We're saying, "Of course you get to say no. Everybody gets to say no whenever they want. But let's get to a hell yes. What would it take for us to get there?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):
That's a really helpful framework and phrase to use is just what would it take to get to hell yes? Not just what would it take to get to you feeling comfortable with this? What would it take for you to just agree to this? It's more a hell yes. And your point there is hell yes is when they actually fully agree. Oftentimes people kind of like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah." And then they don't actually follow through.

Kenneth Berger (00:17:49):
Some people call this a whole body yes because sometimes your head is saying yes, but your heart is saying no or your gut is saying no. And so I think you can really feel in your body when you've got a hell yes, when all of you is fully in and ready to do this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):
And this applies to, you're giving examples here of just getting like aligning a deadline. I imagine the same skill applies to everything in relationship questions and friends and family and work.

Kenneth Berger (00:18:19):
It does. And it is something universal, but I do think of it as being particularly relevant to my work with startups because I work primarily with startup founders. Because with startups you know that mostly they fail. We all know the numbers on that. And so to me, there's a perspective you have to take if you're going to operate in the startup world of being okay with not knowing that you're going to get the outcome you want. A lot of people, we operate in a safer world where we're more clear exactly what the outcomes are going to be, but if you're a startup founder, you've got to be okay with, "I'm just going to go for this, and I know I probably won't get it. But it's so meaningful to me, I'm going to go for it anyway."

(00:19:00):
And so to me, that's not just about the big picture of running a startup, it's about really anything you might want in life, because that's such a useful perspective to say, "I know I'm not going to get it. I know I'm not guaranteed to get it. I'm not going to be attached to that. I know people aren't obligated to tell me yes, but I'm going to go forward anyway because I want it and that's enough."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:20):
So let's actually get into the skill of learning how to actually ask for what you want more effectively. You already described three steps, so maybe just describe them again and let's just walk through them.

Kenneth Berger (00:19:32):
The first step is articulating what you want. And we've gone into this a little bit, but to me, I think that the key places that people tend to have missteps here, or one in this phrase, it's fine. I think of the "it's fine" cartoon with the flames and the dog, I think it is. But I think a lot of us fall into that trap of saying, "You know what? I'm fine. I actually, I don't need anything. I'm good."

(00:19:59):
And again, this is tempting, right? Because it's so nice to have this idea that I'm fine, I don't need anything. And in a certain way, that's a nice attitude because yeah, we're not guaranteed anything, so it's nice to be okay with the status quo. But for those folks, often what I'm encouraging that do is to really tune into the parts of them that maybe aren't so fine like, "Gosh, I'd prefer it a little bit if things were this way or yeah, I'm a little bit bothered by this, or I'm a little bit nervous about this."

(00:20:26):
And so kind of tuning more into those subtle emotions that are pointing them towards, "Sure, I'm okay with the status quo, but I want something more." And so helping them articulate that in a clearer way where they can want something without being attached to having to get it. The other extreme of this is people who articulate these sort of wildly unrealistic goals. So this is the founder that just wants everyone to agree with him all the time and to obey him immediately.

(00:20:56):
So for those folks, it really tends to be more about saying it out loud. Once you say it out loud, it is clearer. That's not really what it's about. And so for those folks, I tend to ask them to go deeper to say, "Yeah, I know you're not a control freak. You don't want everyone to think exactly what you think. What's it really about? What does that get you?" And so often it goes from being this more kind of objective external goal to being a more kind of social emotional goal of, "You know what, I just want to have a team that feels really aligned around me and we're just ready to go for it and we've got each other's backs."

(00:21:35):
That doesn't mean we agree with each other all the time or that we're a hundred percent aligned in everything, but it doesn't mean there's a certain feeling that I have when I go into work. Even though I don't know that we're going to get what we want or that everyone is going to agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:47):
Do you have any examples from your time you could share of someone articulating what they want and figuring out how they articulate, how to articulate what they want just to make it even more real?

Kenneth Berger (00:21:58):
To me a lot of the classic examples are around feedback. Because I work with a lot of founders who are not the sort of classic control freaks. They're super nice and their teams love them and they love their teams. So for them, it can be really hard to deliver hard feedback, to deliver negative feedback and even more to actually create consequences. Because the thing about accepting other people's no is that, "Sure, they can always say no. Everybody gets to say no whenever they want, but there are consequences." And so the classic thing I see with the nice founders is they're really afraid to actually create consequences when people are not living up to their expectations. Right?

(00:22:40):
When they're not aligned with the culture, they're not delivering in the way that the CEO wants them to be delivering because it doesn't seem that nice. They're like, "Oh, I think of myself as nice and of being so kind and of people loving me." And it's like, "Well, that doesn't mean that there aren't consequences for their actions."

(00:22:56):
Part of really respecting them is respecting that they can make the choices they want and they're grownups enough that they can deal with the consequences of those choices."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):
Can you even get more concrete there? Is it we need to hit this date, or are there going to be big problems? Or is it like, "I need you to hire this large of a team?" I don't know. What is it that they're not articulating that they later realize, "Oh, here's what I need to articulate."

Kenneth Berger (00:23:20):
So I think sometimes it is about alignment, the disagree and commit. So I see that a lot of founders saying, "Hey, I'm super respectful of your differing opinion here, and I totally validate you and I appreciate you. Thank you so much for sharing that." But they're not willing to go that extra step and say, "Yeah, but this is the call and I need you to actually follow through with that. I understand that might be disappointing or frustrating or what have you, but part of the expectation for this role is that you can roll with disagree and commit sometimes when that's necessary."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:52):
That's an awesome example. I fully get that and I could see how scary that is to a lot of people. One is just coming to terms with, "This is what I actually want to be doing, but I just don't feel like I can because it's going to, I think, upset people." Okay. So what else can you suggest people do to help identify what it is they want and articulate what they want? So you talked about pay attention to just like, "Oh, this would be better. If this changed, I'd be happier." Or things would probably run better. That's a really cool example of how to think do that because easy, just like, "Oh yeah, if we actually can make a decision in this meeting, that'd be really cool." Maybe we should try to do that and ask for that. Is there any other tips and approaches to helping you figure out what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:24:40):
It always comes back to integrity. And a great way to do an integrity check is to just look have I fully expressed myself? And so I think we've talked a little bit about charting your feelings as a piece of that of like, "Yeah, am I really tuning into how annoyed I am or how frustrated I am or how nervous I am?" Because if I haven't fully owned those feelings and expressed those in whatever way is appropriate, then probably I'm not fully in integrity.

(00:25:09):
I think saying what you have to say is a piece of that too. "Gosh, is there something that I keep thinking about and I'm just like three or four days, I'm just like, man, I really want to say this to this person." At this point, you're probably out of integrity because there's something deep in you that really needs to say this, right? And so to me, articulating what you want is really about mindfulness is about checking for all these things.

(00:25:35):
What is the part of me that's not fully expressed? Because it doesn't mean I'm going to get what I want or that people are going to give me all my dreams immediately, but it feels so much better to have it out. That sort of suffering that fear usually comes from holding it in and saying, "Oh, having these stories of I'm not allowed to say that. It's not appropriate to express that I'm bored in this meeting." Versus saying, "Probably a lot of people would be grateful if we said out loud, 'I'm bored in this meeting.' Let's move things along."

(00:26:56):
Okay. This is a great segue too. Now I have a sense. I need to change this. This needs to change. I'm just scared to say this, to bring it up, to change the way people are operating to ask for what I want. What advice can you share for people to actually do this?

Kenneth Berger (00:27:12):
So for asking what you want, I think the really important tweak here is asking intentionally because I think a lot of us are stuck on a certain track that's comfortable for us when we ask. And so if you're more in the people-pleasing camp, maybe you're used to not asking at all. You're hoping that people are reading your mind and just magically knowing what you want.

(00:27:34):
And if you're more in the control-free camp, maybe you're used to ordering people around and saying, "Go do this now." And so for both of those folks, it's not about... I think if you ask any of them, "Is this working for you?" They'd say no. Of course, it's obvious from an effectiveness standpoint, it's not working well, but they more just haven't embraced that you can do it a different way that they only really see one way of doing it.

(00:28:00):
So part of asking for what you want effectively is really just recognizing the rut that you get stuck in and working through all those narratives that make us resist asking it a different way. Because often the people who don't want to ask have a story that says, "This is too risky. Or it's not worth it. They're going to say no anyway, so why even bother?"

(00:28:24):
So these are all very common things that people go through, but then they end up not actually asking for what they want. Now, actually expressing who they are and what they stand for in the world. And that has a really serious cost. I think that we tend to tell ourselves the story, "Oh, this is fine. I'll be fine." Versus owning, "I'm going to be living my life not asking for what I want." Do I really want to be at my funeral and have people say, "Oh, Kenneth played it safe. He didn't really go for his dreams, but he was nice. No one was ever mad at him." That's not what we want people to say at our eulogies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:01):
No. That's good motivation. Okay. So say in this example you gave of like, "I need us to make a decision. I know I'm trying to keep everyone happy, but we need to make a decision." Do you have advice for maybe phrases of how to approach. You talked about making intentional. How do you actually go about doing that? Is it the way you communicate it? Is it something else? How do you actually do this without pissing people off and also just risking too much?

Kenneth Berger (00:29:33):
Even implicit in that question, to me that's that question of, "Oh, how do I do it without being any risk of ever pissing anyone off?" That's a piece of the resistance right there. And so this is a great example of the type of work that we have to do, right? Because in theory, asking is easy, "Oh, you just try some way and maybe people are pissed off and maybe they're not." But probably it's going to be fine and you'll have the chance to try again and iterate and work from it.

(00:30:00):
But often we get stuck so we don't get to go through those levels of iteration because we want to make sure we're going to get the outcome. We say, "Oh, well, I'm not willing to ever piss anyone off ever. And so I'm just going to be stuck at this step because I haven't figured out what's going to guarantee me." And of course, there's no guarantee. We can never guarantee that people are going to feel a particular way.

(00:30:22):
So part of asking for what you want effectively is actually bringing some compassion for yourself. Of course, we all want to be sure that the way we ask is going to be effective and no one is going to be mad at us and we're going to get all of our dreams come true. But we don't get that. I wish we did. That would be nice. But is that worth not pursuing your dreams in life?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Such a good point about what you identified and the way... I think a lot of people that think about it, it's just like, "I'd always do this without causing anyone any pain or risking anything going wrong." I think that's, to your point, part of it. So you talk a lot about founders. You work with a lot of founders, a lot of listeners here are not founders, they're product managers, ICs on teams, other functions that don't have "power". Is there anything that you suggest these folks do differently or think about this differently or is it kind of the same thing? In the end everyone has power in some way. How would you think about this if you're just, say, a product manager, individual contributor?

Kenneth Berger (00:31:23):
I think one of the most important balances in terms of the asking step is both asking clearly, but asking with great humility. And this actually works whether you're in a position of power or not because I think a lot of folks will go so far to the end of humility. They say, "Well, I'm not going to say this out loud at all." But in fact, if you're willing to say, I really disagree with this product decision and I would really prefer that we make this different decision. I know it's not my call and I'm just one opinion and a lot of people are going to see things differently and that's fine, but it's important to me that you know that. So what do you think? Are you willing to reconsider this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:00):
That's such a great approach. It's very not scary to say that. It also, I think, highlights something I wanted to touch on is I think people have a lot more influence and power than they think they do. Say a PM on a team disagrees with a plan for a product. People actually care about your opinion and you could actually change things. But just telling them, "I think this is a bad idea." And you often don't. Is that what you find, that people have a lot more influence than they think they do? Anything along those lines that comes up?

Kenneth Berger (00:32:35):
You're giving me deep goosebumps because I think this is a really underappreciated thing in terms of asking for what we want because especially in the PM world, we're trained to look for data. We're not just going to state an opinion. We're going to say, "Oh, the AB test said this. Or 30% of our users do this, or the ROI on this is X." And data is great. We love data for a reason of course. And I think people forget about exactly what you're highlighting, that your relationships matter, and that just your opinion because you believe something or because you want something often that's enough.

(00:33:13):
Because guess what? You're in a relationship with these people you work with. They care about you. You have some sort of leverage with them. And I think that often people go the other way and say, "Oh, I've got power. I'm going to try and leverage it." But actually, if you go the other direction and you're humble and you say, "I know I can't make you do anything, it's not my call to make. But man, this is really what I want. I'm just going to put it out there and ask." That I think it feels really vulnerable and uncomfortable to not lean on data as a sort of way of saying, "No, no, I'm right, so you should believe what I believe." But just say, "Actually, I don't know that I'm right. This is just what I think and I hope that's enough on its own."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):
Do you find that that's actually a crutch a lot of times to people not saying anything is they don't have that data? They don't have evidence and they just, "I shouldn't say anything. If someone asks for why I don't have a great answer, I just think this is what should be."

Kenneth Berger (00:34:03):
Totally. And I think there's a balance there as with anything. Is ignoring data and going in gut all the time, great? Probably not, right? We use data for a reason, but I think there are all these moments when we are making a gut decision and having all the data there means having the opinion set out loud. I think often the dangers of people saying, "Oh, I don't have data to back this up. It's just what I think. And I'm not sure people are going to agree with me, so I'm just not going to say it."

(00:34:35):
So we don't have the data of all those gut opinions of these subject matter experts in the room, even though that gut information to me is just as important as anything we could get from the SQL database or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:48):
Before we move on to step three, you talked about the opposite of asking for what you want. This was just step two is just complaining and being angry later like, "I knew this project was going to fail. I knew this was a terrible deadline. I knew this design was not great." Anything more you want to say along those lines of just like, "If you're not asking for what you want, complaining is often a sign that you should be doing that more"?

Kenneth Berger (00:35:11):
To me, complaints are great inspiration. To me, I love radical candor, for example, where I try to go a step further than radical candor is to not just say, "Hey, here's my feedback. Just wanted you to know." But to say, "And I want something. I would like to see an outcome." And so I think that to me it's all about the effective framing that the complaint is probably not going to be an effective way to do it, but it can be great inspiration to say, "Gosh, that complaining means I'm frustrated. What am I frustrated about? Let me envision that better future. Let me think about what's an effective way to actually move towards that. What's an effective way to communicate that desire that's actually likely to get me towards a yes?"

(00:35:58):
And so when we actually embrace that sort of frustration, annoying, complaining thing and follow that thread down and think about how to be effective that way, we can actually get something really compelling and useful, but it requires actually embracing that part of ourselves that sometimes we're a little bit ashamed of like, "Oh, I don't like that whiny part of myself. I'm just going to push that one down versus actually taking what it has to say as important data."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:24):
That's a really good point. I think that's actually another blocker for a lot of people is just, "I don't want to be a complaining person. I just want to be like, let's do this. I'm in, let's go. I don't want to be seen as a squeaky wheel." Is there anything you say there about as a resistance point for people?

Kenneth Berger (00:36:40):
Well, I'm a big fan of internal family systems, which is this sort of psychotherapy technique that really talks about parts and the sort of parts of ourselves and the ways in which they don't always agree with each other. Part of why I love this approach is, A, because we already use this language. We say, "Part of me thinks this, a part of me thinks that." And really when I talk about how to work through resistance, really it's about embracing and validating all of our parts.

(00:37:07):
Because often we're really comfortable with one part of ourselves that we think is, "Oh, this part is virtuous and good and great, and this part is whiny and bad, and not great, and I don't respect that part of me as much." So really to sort of ask effectively, we generally need to embrace all these parts and really bring in all the information they're bringing in because if we ignore the part that's really scared to ask, well, then we're going to stay stuck.

(00:37:32):
Versus if we come in and say, "Hey, buddy, why are you scared? You seem terrified. What's going on? Oh, well man, you think your whole professional reputation has staked on this and you're an imposter and they're going to find out, and then you'll never work again? Well, of course you'd be scared. That makes a ton of sense." And by embracing that, instead of ignoring that and being ashamed of that, that is often how we soften those fears and say, "I know that's scary, but we also know that's not really true. You're not an imposter, right? You're an experienced professional."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:01):
Man, there's so many threads we can't follow here. This whole line of internal family systems, right?

Kenneth Berger (00:38:06):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:07):
That's its own podcast episode potentially. And then imposter syndrome, we've touched a bunch of different podcast episodes, but I'll avoid going in that direction. Something you reminded me of is we just had Carole Robin on the podcast who taught this class touchy-feely at Stanford for a long time, which is all about helping people learn how to deal with other people, which we never learned in life. It's like a class, how to learn to work with other people.

Kenneth Berger (00:38:29):
I took one of Stanford's T-Group Weekends, summer of 2020, I think a month after George Floyd was murdered and was facilitated by a black woman. And it was one of the most profound transformative weekends of my life. Because T-groups already people rave about them. But having it at that point in history with those people in the room, oof.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
A lot of tears, I imagine.

Kenneth Berger (00:38:54):
It was crazy. I mean, it was really wild.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
I feel like every single person that has gone through, I think it's called Leaders in Tech is the broader umbrella term. And Carole talked about it. Everyone that has gone through it, 100% have told me that it's a transformative life experience for them. And you had a bonus transformational piece. So anyway, if people want to check out that episode, I will include it in the show notes. But the reason I brought it up is Carole shared this framework for how to actually give feedback in a way where people can receive it that I'll just highlight here. I have it here.

(00:39:26):
And it's somewhat related to nonviolent communication, which is what you touched on. And she told me, actually, she taught this way before nonviolent communication came out with their whole philosophy. And it's basically when you want to give someone feedback, the template is when you do a behavior, I feel a feeling, and she's big on like say actual feeling word not like, "I feel like, or I feel that," blah, blah, blah. And step three is, "I'm telling you this because..." and then what you want them to change. Do you find that sort of approach helpful?

Kenneth Berger (00:40:01):
I do. I teach the same thing. I think sort of Carole's approach and nonviolent communication, DBT teaches a similar approach. They call dear man.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:12):
To me, what's DBT?

Kenneth Berger (00:40:14):
It's a dialectical behavioral therapy. It's related to CBT. So there's kind of rough consensus in the sort of personal development world of how to ask. And really what they have in common is around staying really factual because I think that what can we know factually well? We can know our thoughts, we can know our feelings because no one else can know that better than us. Maybe we can trust our eyes. What would a video camera have recorded? And that's about it.

(00:40:44):
So I think often we get really distracted by all these stories we have about the data, but when we bring it back to that fundamental core of this is what I think, this is what I feel, this is what I've observed in the world, it tends to make the ask a lot clearer versus these stories like you mentioned of, "I feel like you're an asshole." It's like, "Well, that's a story. That's not a fact."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):
Yeah. I feel that is not the right way to say I feel. What do you actually feel? No. Okay, so let's move to step three. We've been going on this whole tangent of therapy and stuff, which is amazing, but let's make sure we cover all three steps. So step one again was articulate what you want. Step two is ask for what you want. What's step three?

Kenneth Berger (00:41:28):
So to me step three is actually the trickiest for most people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:32):
So far, they're all tricky to me.

Kenneth Berger (00:41:34):
Oh yeah, they're all tricky, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:36):
The most tricky.

Kenneth Berger (00:41:38):
But step three is accept the response. And it might seem so simple, but it actually is kind of subtle. And so one reason is that idea of sort of the whole body yes or the hell yes. Because I think often we really want a yes. And so we're very, very biased to look for a yes versus accepting no, "That was a no." If someone made this face, that's a no. It doesn't matter what comes out of their mouth. And so the challenge of accepting the response is often that of hearing the no, but not over accepting or under accepting it.

(00:42:18):
Because I think sometimes what people who are really afraid to ask will do is they say, oh, well, that was a no. So it's no forever and I should never ask again. My dream is dead and nothing is ever going to happen for me again." And that's because they get so scared. But actually no, that's over accepting. The no is just from this person right now in the way that you asked, which doesn't necessarily mean anything about the next time you ask to a different person in a different way, in a different time.

(00:42:44):
And on the flip side, in that sort of more control freak mode, I think for them they'll often skip over the response say, "Well, they said no, but they don't know what they're talking about." Or they're my direct report, so they have to do what I say. So these are all fundamentally disrespectful ways to operate in this relationship. When we're talking about asking for what we want, we're talking about influence. So you need to have good relationships. You can't be influential with a bad relationship.

(00:43:13):
So really accepting the response is about, yes, I'm going to be genuine about what I want, but I'm also going to genuinely care about you and have deep respect for your ability to consent or not consent to whatever the ask is. Because I think the counterintuitive thing is that often when we really respect people's no's, it can actually be more influential, more motivating. If someone says, "Okay. I'm not ready to deliver this on time." Be like, "Okay. Well, I'm going to give the project to another person."

(00:43:46):
I'm taking your no at face value. And they say, "Oh gosh, well, I didn't realize that was going to be the consequence. Maybe I can get it done by that time." And so that way you're not forcing them and you're not coercing them, right? You're just saying, "No, you said no? So that your no is no, and I accept that."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):
So it feels like part of the skill here is preparing, is knowing. Some people just say no and that's okay. That's part of the experience. Part of it is if there's this not yet component... We had Mihika Kapoor on the podcast. She has a PM at Figma and she had this really great approach to building new things within companies is just like everything to her is not yet and no is a not yet. And the way you phrased it is it could just be the way you asked. It could be, maybe they'll agree if you can figure out a better way to pitch the thing. Is there anything more you can add there about just this idea of it's not no forever?

Kenneth Berger (00:44:36):
Acceptance of the response is primarily an emotional regulation issue because once we get our emotions intact, it's just, is it yes or is it no? And if it's no, which it probably is, most of the time the world tells us no, then the question is, "All right, what can I learn from this? What am I going to try next?" And so when we're able to emotionally regulate, it's all very cut and dry, right? It's like, "Okay. Here's data to tell me what to try next."

(00:45:02):
And so really, 99% of the challenge tends to be all the feelings that come up for us when we hear no. Because We hate hearing no. It's so uncomfortable. And so part of the practice of getting good at asking for what we want is recognizing you're going to hear no all the time, and that's completely normal and fine, and it doesn't need to be something so scary or awful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):
Easier said than done in real life. Is there an example of either a client of yours... I know you can't actually share specific details, but I'm just curious if there's an example that comes up of someone dealing with this and getting better at it, or your own career.

Kenneth Berger (00:45:38):
I gave a talk about this sort of right after it happened, but I was fired from Slack three different times, which I feel like has to be some kind of startup record. I don't know who would be the record-keeping body for this. But now 10 years on, I have different perspective, of course. And so this was almost exactly 10 years ago, spring of 2014 and I just gotten the job as the first PM at Slack. It was already the hottest thing out there. It was only a couple dozen employees.

(00:46:03):
I came in excited, but also a little insecure because I had just come off my breakup with my co-founder. I just wanted to put my head down and do a good job. I was engaged at the time, so Slack already knew I was going to be going away on a bachelor or backpacking trip. I have a wedding and honeymoon in the fall. And so I came in naive and overconfident of, "I've been a founder. I've worked on iconic products. I know how to do this. I'm a pro. I'm just going to go in and do the work."

(00:46:32):
So instead of getting really clear on what does success look like here or what's your culture or what are your expectations of me, I just went in and made my best guess and went for it. And lo and behold, turns out what I came in with, that supreme overconfidence was not what they wanted at all. They'd kind of been in the trenches reinventing from the game to Slack. They'd been through layoffs, really hard times together. So they wanted someone to come in humble and to earn their trust of this kind of core team that had been together for years.

(00:47:07):
I just didn't get any of that. I wasn't hearing that feedback. I wasn't hearing those nos, and I wasn't articulating what I wanted. What I wanted was really very basic. I just wanted to figure out how to do a good job, and I wanted to have a good relationship with the CEO because I was working for him. And you need to have a good relationship with your boss. But the problem was in the first firing anyway was I had not articulated those goals.

(00:47:36):
And so I shouldn't have been surprised when six weeks into my tenure at Slack, I came back from my backpacking trip with my bachelor buddies, and I had an email in my inbox saying, "Hey, you're fired. It seems like it's not working out. Let me know how you want to wrap it up." So as you can imagine, I freaked out. I loved this job, I love this company, so I profusely apologized. I said, "I'll do whatever it takes. I'm so sorry. I'm going to be committed to turn this around."

(00:48:07):
And so early stage startup turns out firing doesn't always stick. Monday morning, I had my job back. But obviously things were not the same as they'd been before because in the second era, what I wanted was sort of better articulated more clear, but all of a sudden that fear that had been under the surface, that insecurity was now very, very present every day because I was terrified of was I going to get fired? Was I going to not make the most of this opportunity? And so I went fully into people pleaser mode. And so that meant that even though what I desperately wanted was to have this good relationship was to be successful, build a great product. I had a year of one-on-ones with the CEO.

(00:48:52):
I never, never ever asked for what I wanted. I never said it out loud because I was scared. I was scared of what the consequences were. I knew there were a hundred PMs standing behind me ready to take my job if the CEO is ever a moment unhappy with me. I said, "No, I'm not going to take the risk. I'm too scared of what the consequences might be." And so I held all that fear and all those desires of, "I just want to do a great job. I want us to be awesome partners and build this amazing industry changing product."

(00:49:22):
I never said any of that stuff out loud. I just put my head down and I tried to obey. And so as you can imagine, this didn't work very well. I was feeling horrible day to day. I was terrified of this guy I was working for. And so again, I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was, when I got fired for the second time. It wasn't quite firing. But this time I'd come back from my honeymoon and I had a phone call on Monday that said, "Seems like product management is not working out for Slack. We're actually just going to get rid of product. You're going to be user research. It's going to be fine."

(00:49:56):
And for me, I love user research, but that was the beginning of my career. I was not interested in going back to that. What was fascinating was at that point, I was actually able to articulate what I wanted there and was willing to say it out loud. Because what I wanted was, "No, let's keep me in product. I've got an idea for how we can run it." So I wrote a proposal, I sent it around to the management team. Turns out, when you actually ask for what you want out loud, you're much more likely to get it.

(00:50:21):
And so within a week, this new plan had traction with the management team team and I had my old job back again. Everything was fine except of course it wasn't fine because now I was scared, but the stakes seemed really high, and this is where that deep imposter syndrome sit in. I was like, "Am I even any good at this? Should I even be in product management? Am I ever going to work in this industry again? Is this going to be my dark secret that I take to the grave that Stewart Butterfield fired me three times?"

(00:50:58):
I think what I couldn't be with in that moment was the no's, because I was getting no after no after no after no from Stewart and the rest of the management team saying, "What you're doing is not working for us, right? Your ask are not landing. You're not being effective in the way that you want to be effective." And because I wasn't able to hear those no's again, because to that emotional regulation standpoint, I couldn't handle the feelings of like, "Ugh, maybe what I'm doing is not good enough."

(00:51:26):
So instead of pointing the finger at myself, I pointed the finger at him. I said, "You know what? Actually this guy, he's not such a great manager. He's not so good at product. I'm the one who was on the ground with the users. I know what's right." Against all evidence to the contrary, by the way, is this product luminary, visionary, famous person.

(00:51:45):
So clearly not based on any facts, but it was an emotional issue of I couldn't deal with the reality of what I was doing was not working. And so again, because I was not articulating what I wanted, I was not asking for it and I certainly was not listening to the no's. I shouldn't have been surprised when finally the third time it came down, and this time it was serious because we had HR.

(00:52:09):
So it turns out once you hire HR, the firings are final. And so I only made it to a year at Slack and it was a year of just utter torture because I spent that year being fully out of integrity with myself. Never saying what I really wanted, how I really felt because it didn't feel safe. I was too scared. I kept it all inside. And it took me six months or a year even after that to really feel safe and okay again. It was a serious decompression time.

(00:52:39):
My wife and I had a baby during that time. I was on zero sleep. It was a rough, rough period. But the irony is that when I actually came out of that experience, the reality of it was extremely simple. I hadn't articulated what I wanted. I hadn't asked for what I wanted. I had not listened to the no's in response to my non-ask.

(00:53:02):
And so of course I was unhappy with the result. Why would I have expected anything different? I wasn't the victim. Stewart wasn't the villain. It was just ineffective asking. And so to me, especially because I was already on that path towards coaching, that lesson hit really hard in terms of how do we make this work more sustainable?

(00:53:24):
We stay in integrity with ourselves even when it's hard, even when it's scary, even when we don't know exactly what the outcome is going to be. And so that's really the story of how I became a coach, of seeing exactly how much I'd screwed up at Slack and seeing how much I had suffered and how much a lot of people suffer in these similar circumstances. All you have to do to turn it around is ask for what you want.

(00:53:45):
So this is why I'm so passionate about this stuff because it can sound so fluffy to say, "Oh, focus on integrity. Honor your desires. No, it's real life stuff of a year of suffering, of pain, of fear." I don't want other people to be going through that and that's why I'm so passionate about this stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
Wow, what a story. I love that it's kind of a microcosm of everything we've talked about. You've did all the things that you teach people to avoid.

Kenneth Berger (00:54:18):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:18):
And I think what's interesting is you went through these three phases. Interestingly, at the beginning, your first phase was you were not hearing the no's, but it was rooted in this confidence that you're a founder, you're awesome. They're so lucky to have you. I know what I'm doing, get out of my way. And then the third phase, you also, the issue there was you weren't hearing the no's, but it was more from fear of being fired again. And so it's interesting that there's these different reasons you're not hearing what people are actually saying.

Kenneth Berger (00:54:46):
Totally. Well, and to me, the first one is about articulation as well because I think that if in the beginning it articulated that, "Yeah, I'm confident, but actually I want to do a really good job and I want to have good relationships. So let me think about intentionally, how do I create those outcomes?" But because I hadn't articulated that's what I wanted, it didn't even occur to me like, "Oh yeah, I need to do some intentional relationship building, figure out some metrics for success."

(00:55:11):
It was an early stage startup. There wasn't a ton of sort of process or structure in place, suffice to say. And so if I wanted that, I needed to create it myself, but because I hadn't articulated that any of that was important to me, I just flew by the seat of my pants and it took failing to get some data to say, "Ooh, yeah, maybe I need to look at this more closely."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):
I imagine you've gone through this exercise many times, but say you were to do it again, what would you do differently and what do you think would've happened? Do you think you would've stayed there for many, many years, had a product at Slack at this point? Just imagining that reality, what would you have done differently? And then what would you have imagined have turned out?

Kenneth Berger (00:55:49):
Well, I mean obviously broadly, I would've asked for what I wanted and what I wanted was I wanted to do the best work of our life. I wanted to have a deep professional partner in the CEO and the rest of the product and management team. And I wanted to produce great work that people loved. And that was part of why I was attracted to the culture and the mission and the company. And so this is what's tricky is of course, that's what I would've done. Now, do I know what the outcome would've been?

(00:56:16):
No, I might've been fired even sooner. They might've said, "No, this is not working out. Let's just be done here." So that's what's tricky about this is it really isn't about the outcome. Of course, asking for what you want makes you more likely to get the outcome you want, but you don't do it for guarantee of a certain outcome because no one can promise you that. You do it so you can stay in integrity with yourself and not suffer through all this. Because at least then I would've said, "You know what? It didn't work out. At least I'm not sitting here suffering. I can get another job at another startup. It's not the end of the world."

(00:56:51):
And I think that the mistake we make is pretending that it is of saying, going into fight or flight and saying, "This is a severe existential threat to who I am and my safety in the world," versus being like, "I'm disappointed. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):
That's a really profound point that this practice isn't necessarily to just have everything work out beautifully and to get the things you're looking for. It's to feel like you did, which you could have and to feel integrity with yourself that you did what you needed to do and you're not going to regret something down the road.

Kenneth Berger (00:57:29):
Indeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):
I'm going to take a quick tangent down the being the first PM route real quick. There's a lot of people that think about being the first PM at a startup join as the first PM. I imagine you work with people asking for advice along these lines. It's classically a very challenging role. Many people don't last. Many people follow your trajectory where it's like, "Oh, shit. What have I done?" Any advice for people that are a first PM at a company or startup or thinking about that role?" What can you tell them to help them be successful or at least not suffer?

Kenneth Berger (00:58:05):
To me, it really is about the relationship with the CEO or with the founders because that's the root of a lot of the issues that come out of that scenario because it's not always you. In my story, I think it was primarily about me, but I also work with a lot of founders who are going through really tough things. My clue to people who report to a founder is to say, "Imagine if you're confused about how your founder is behaving. Imagine that they're terrified all the time, and see if that makes their behavior more clear."

(00:58:38):
Because it is scary to be a founder. Everything is on your shoulders. And I think a lot of people do feel that sense of high stakes all the time. And so I think being real about that of what is the state that the person or the people you're working for are in and sort of working within that versus sort of pretending that it's something else or wishing that it were something else is the path to having a healthy relationship. Because if you don't have a healthy relationship with the person you're working for, you're not going to get anything done. You're not going to succeed in any meaningful way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:10):
I love that framework of how to think about why a founder is behaving in a certain way. Just maybe a last following thread there is just what should people look for to help them understand if the founder and them are a good fit, if they're going to have a good time working with that founder? Is there anything just like questions they might ask or ways of operating that are useful to understand like, "Okay, I think I'll be okay with this founder in this company as the first PM or not.

Kenneth Berger (00:59:34):
I think it's a hard thing to generalize about, but to me it really is about understanding expectations. I guess this is a predictable coming from me, "But what do you really want? Because I think that often the founders put together a job description, but then they're faced with a real human being who has real human subtleties and things they're good at or not so good at." And so being very, very clear about expectations and of figuring out collaboratively a way to work together that's effective to me is there's no guarantees of course, but it gives you a more sure path to having a productive relationship.

(01:00:13):
It's actually something that I recommend to a lot of founders for maybe their first 10 or 15, or 20 employees of just have a relationship design conversation with each of them when they're first hired. Because I think a lot of us come in naive the way I did, assuming, "Oh yeah, I'm just going to come in and do my thing the way I've always done it. It's going to be fine." Versus coming in and saying, "I actually don't know how I'm going to operate at this company. I have range like anyone has range, and I don't know what this company needs and who else is here and sort of what my role and what my place is going to be within these other people. And so by really understanding that intentionally and not from a place of performance management, you're already doing this poorly, you're in big trouble. But what is the best way to work together given who we have now and what we want and what we need? Let's figure it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:01):
Coming back to our core topic, is there anything that we didn't cover, anything that I should have asked you about the skill, the art of asking for what you want? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?

Kenneth Berger (01:01:12):
I do want to mention something that I hear a lot from founders when I talk about the piece of working through resistance because I think a lot of them say, "Oh, you want me to let go of fear and focus on what I want? Well, I mean, I've been running from fear my whole career. That's how I'm so hard-working and I'm so smart is I'm always afraid I'm not good enough."

(01:01:34):
Am I going to be able to do this job without fear hounding me every step of the way? I just remember the first time I heard this, it broke my heart, and now I've heard it dozens of times I'd say. So I mean, it really is. I think it's a belief that sits deep in the hearts of a lot of us high achieving Silicon Valley tech types of, "My fear of not being good enough is what drives me to be great."

(01:02:00):
And I just want to come out here and say there's other ways to motivate. You can motivate based on joy, based on vision, based on your inspiration in this vision of what you want. I think a lot of folks I talk to are skeptical understandably because operated a different way their whole life and all I can really say is try it. Try following an inspiring vision that's really meaningful to you and just see what it's like to not be living in fear all the time because it is a big difference and it's really meaningful. It matters a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):
So is the fear there that if they ask for what they want, they'll get what they want and they let go of this drive to prove themselves? And is that the fear? How is it that they move away from that need to prove themselves?

Kenneth Berger (01:02:51):
Well, I mean that's a longer story. I would say managing our own fear as a sort of lifelong practice. I'm not going to claim I'm anywhere near done with it. But I guess I'd just say that I think part of the big shift I see in personal development for people I work with is from saying, "Oh, no, my fear is good. I need it. It's keeping me safe."

(01:03:16):
To saying, "Fear is for when there's a tiger chasing you and there's no tiger chasing me." I'm sitting in my office in a desk chair on a zoom call. There's no real danger here. And so fear is not particularly functional. And so when they start realizing that, the practice becomes, "Oh yeah, I'm feeling afraid." But I'm reminding myself there's not a tiger in the room. If I really want to get things done, achieve my goals, I need to focus on vision on what I want to achieve in the world, not on avoiding all these fears. So that's the short of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
Amazing. It reminds me, we have a chat... I had a chat with Matt Mochari, and we spent a bunch of time on dealing with fear and overcoming fear. So folks want to dig deeper there. They could check out that episode. Just maybe one more question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, classic contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you have a contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that most other people don't.

Kenneth Berger (01:04:16):
For me, I'm not a big believer in discipline that I think some folks come to coaching looking for a drill sergeant and say, "All right. Shout at me and tell me to do better." And I start to say, "That's not how I operate." Because it's not the discipline doesn't work, but it's like people-pleasing. It's a short-term coping strategy. Discipline will get you in the gym for a week, but it's not going to get you in the gym for a year. The people who are in the gym for a year are doing it because they want to.

(01:04:49):
There's actually something that's motivating for them in that. It's not just, "Oh, I hate this, but I'm going to go anyway." And so I try to be really clear with people about that, that I'm not going to be the drill sergeant because it's unsustainable. Someone shouting at you is not going to get you moving towards what you want in life over multiple years. It's days or weeks or even hours thing. And so I really look for a higher bar to say, "Let's look for true long-term sustainable motivation," which means relying on vision, pursuing what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:25):
I love that it all ties back to knowing what you want, asking for what you want, and then dealing with the answers that you get.

Kenneth Berger (01:05:30):
I am a broken record admittedly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
Amazing. Kenneth, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kenneth Berger (01:05:40):
No, but just thank you for letting me share this stuff. It really is my life's work and I'm very passionate about it and I hope it's helpful for people. I'm going to be writing more about it on LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Okay, amazing. We'll point people there. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kenneth Berger (01:05:57):
I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:58):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kenneth Berger (01:06:03):
Well, I already mentioned Radical Candor. I think that is for sure a modern classic and I think that whole idea of challenging directly, but caring personally is very much aligned with what I'm talking about, right? Because you need the relationships and you need to actually speak your truth. So I love Kim Scott's writing on that stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):
We had a Kim Scott on the podcast. Folks want to dig deeper there. We'll link to that episode. I'll let you keep going. Sorry for the interruption.

Kenneth Berger (01:06:31):
Yeah. I mean I mentioned before, but I actually took Jonny Miller's Nervous System Mastery course. I just wrapped up. So you've had lots of great personal professional development thinkers on the podcast, so thank you for introducing me to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:47):
I'm so happy to hear that. We'll link to that episode as well. I love that. What a circle of life we've got here, guests following other guests, taking their courses, joining the podcast. What a happy world.

Kenneth Berger (01:06:58):
Yeah, indeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:00):
Okay. Any other books before we move on?

Kenneth Berger (01:07:02):
I also love the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, so I'm pretty sure other guests have mentioned that as well. But to me, part of why I like that is that I think a lot of personal development books are not very directive. They say, "Oh, just dig deeply and find your truth." And while there is value to that, of course, I think sometimes it's nice to have some direction of, "Here's 15 things that generally your life's going to be better if you do them." And so to me, it's a nice balance of embracing the really deep stuff of how to live a good life and be effective in the world and be really directive. Try this stuff. It works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Kenneth Berger (01:07:43):
I'm a recent tennis fanatic, so it was one of the things I picked up during the pandemic, so I really enjoyed Netflix's Breakpoint because it's a documentary on the best tennis players in the world. I just find it so... I don't know. It is just beautiful seeing how everyone is the same because all these people, they all know all the strokes perfectly. They're technically perfect in pretty much every way. And so it really is mental.

(01:08:10):
For those folks, it is about working through resistance as well. When they have a that says, "Oh, I'm behind. The other person is better. I'm not going to be able to do this." Are they believing that or are they working through that resistance and saying, "That's just a story I have. I actually don't know what's going to happen, but I'm going to try to win."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):
I love that you see coaching opportunities in everything even entertainment.

Kenneth Berger (01:08:34):
I mean actually speaking of that, I mean, it's almost too on the nose, but there's this movie living from a couple of years ago. This British actor is this sort of tough, old sort of stodgy government office manager, and he gets diagnosed with cancer. And he has this real transformation where he thinks about, "God, I've just been sitting in an office filing papers my whole life. What do I actually want to do with the last months of my life?" And he builds this playground for children, and that's actually his legacy. Sorry, actually, spoiler alert. Whoops, should've.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
You mentioned tennis and you mentioned British people. I will actually be at Wimbledon this year in London with my dad in July and we're going to host a meetup there while I'm there just for anyone listening right now, just to give you a heads up.

Kenneth Berger (01:09:26):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:27):
How fun is that going to be? Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Kenneth Berger (01:09:33):
Well, it's funny. I used to be a big wine aficionado, and I think as with many of us, I am discovering I feel better with less alcohol in my life. And so one of the things I've been picking up is oolong tea. I've got a little cup of Taiwanese [foreign language 01:09:51] in front of me, and I feel like it's all the nerdery that I put into wine of regions, and varietals, and history and processing, but it's actually good for me. It's like full of antioxidants and makes me more focused and I can drink it during the day. I've been totally going down a nerdy tea rabbit hole, and I recommend it. Taiwanese mountain teas especially.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:16):
I got to give me some of that. I always have tea here when I'm doing these podcasts. I'm a less sophisticated tea drinker. I just go with Earl Grey, but a really nice Earl Grey, and so I'm going to have to buy some of this. Do you have a place in a brand you recommend most?

Kenneth Berger (01:10:30):
There's lots of great stores online. You can check out teafromtaiwan.com. That's a good one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
They're going to get a bunch of traffic. They're like, "What the hell just happened?" Teafromtaiwan.com amazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful, share with friends or family and work around life?

Kenneth Berger (01:10:52):
I mean, I'm pretty sure you can guess, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:54):
I wonder what it might be. I wonder what it might be.

Kenneth Berger (01:11:00):
So this is actually part of why I started writing this book, is because my friends were probably annoyed with me telling them, "Have you asked for what you wanted? Ask for what you want." Because yeah, it's best advice I have is to ask for what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):
It all just comes back to that final question. We've been talking a lot about asking for what you want. Kenneth Berger, what do you want?

Kenneth Berger (01:11:25):
Ooh. All right. Well, I think for me, Lenny, you are already an industry luminary with thousands of followers. I am interested in sharing more of these ideas. So if y'all would come follow me on LinkedIn and subscribe to my newsletter, I'm going to be exploring these ideas and sharing more of this stuff because I just am so passionate about it. I'd love if you'd come and join me in that journey, bring questions and ideas, and I'd love to talk about this stuff because I just find it endlessly interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):
But you're working on a book along these lines at some point that will come out, right?

Kenneth Berger (01:12:03):
That's right, that's right. I am working on it in book form, but part of what I've been doing is I realize I want to work on it in community. Speaking of asking for what you want, I mean, for me, it's not just about my vision and my framing, but I'm a coach. I'm not just about big ideas. I'm about making a difference for my clients. And so I realize, if I really want to make a difference with people, I need... It's like a product, I need to get out in the world and test out these ideas and see what lands with people and what's effective for them and what works, and hear the stories and really get into it. So that's kind of why I've been putting myself more out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
Amazing. So along those lines, two last questions. Where can folks actually find you online and follow the stuff that you're writing and how can listeners be useful to you?

Kenneth Berger (01:12:47):
So you can find me on LinkedIn. I'm Kenneth Berger, B-E-R-G-E-R. So please follow me there. Subscribe to the Ask for What You Want newsletter. And you can check out my website, kberger.com, K-B-E-R-G-E-R.

# Taxi mafias, cash vaults & 100% MoM growth: The story of SEA’s biggest startup | Kevin Aluwi (Gojek)

## Transcript

Kevin Aluwi (00:00:00):
In the early days of Gojek, there was a lot of resistance to our services. The most common form of that resistance in the early days was actually by motorcycle taxi mafia. So you would have these areas that are essentially controlled through violence by specific area mafia. And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them, and I think it would've been easy for us to say like, "Hey, they're all contractors. They're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out." But instead, we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help our drivers in those situations, to help kind of extract them out of these sticky situations. And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time.

Lenny (00:01:16):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Kevin Aluwi. Kevin is the co-founder and former CEO of a company called Gojek, which I've always been fascinated by. You may recall a former guest Crystal Widjaja, who was head of growth at Gojek, and I've always wanted to get more of the story. Gojek is infamous for their scrappiness, their unique approach to ops and growth, and as being one of the first and most successful super apps in the world. They've also long been maybe the biggest startup in Indonesia and all of Southeast Asia. Kevin and the story of Gojek have a lot to teach founders in the US and all over the world, and so I was really excited to sit down with Kevin to dig into the story, he did not disappoint.

(00:02:04):
You'll hear all kinds of wild stories about them having to hire a private security team to protect their drivers, having to build their own cash distribution centers to pay their drivers, plus how they won in large part thanks to their early investment in brand, why it's important to do the hard things as a startup. Also, why super apps are surprisingly overrated and much more. Enjoy this episode with Kevin Aluwi after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:29):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how can I help your team run smoother and be more efficient? I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:03:07):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at coda.io/lenny and get a thousand dollars startup credit on your first statement. That's coda.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.

(00:03:45):
This episode is brought to you by rows.com, the world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago, and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain. Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share.

(00:04:20):
If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to do your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook ads, or Twitter. Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce or HubSpot directly into Rows. And when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read and embed charts, tables and calculators into Notion, Confluence or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rose. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:05:01):
Kevin, welcome to the podcast.

Kevin Aluwi (00:05:03):
Thank you. Thanks for having me, Lenny. We've finally made it happen after a few weeks or months of going back and forth.

Lenny (00:05:10):
Yeah, I'm really excited to finally meet you and to dig into a bunch of stuff. I think this is going to be a really unique episode. I don't often have founders on the podcast, especially founders of companies that are not based in the US. In this case, Indonesia, Crystal Widjaja, who is on this podcast previously. One of my favorite guests is just like "Lenny, you got to get Kevin on your podcast." And so here we are.

Kevin Aluwi (00:05:32):
I'm glad to be in a small group of category of people that you invite. Thank you. I'm a huge fan of what you do.

Lenny (00:05:38):
Thanks, man, I really appreciate that. And just redirect to you, you are the co-founder of a company called Gojek. Many people listening have never heard of Gojek, especially people in the US. So just to start, can you just describe what is Gojek, what do y'all do? And then also I think more interestingly is just the scale of I think people in the US, their mind will blow once they hear the scale you've reached with this company. They probably hadn't heard of it.

Kevin Aluwi (00:06:03):
So Gojek started as a motorcycle taxi based service. So it's a kind of uniquely Indonesian things where we have millions of motorcycle taxi drivers in all of the urban centers in Indonesia. And so we started with a very local problem and the first product was a on-demand super app, if you will, where you could ask someone on a motorcycle to give you a ride, send a package for you or buy something and deliver it to you. This then evolved over the years into a more general on demand consumer super app that also included car drivers and other services ranging from the ones mentioned to grocery deliveries and payments and financial services.

(00:06:52):
And today we took the company public about a year and a half ago after we merged with Indonesia's top e-commerce platform. And we've managed to also expand outside of just Indonesia, where today we have about 2.7 million drivers across Southeast Asia. We've completed about 3 billion orders last year, so that's 3 billion orders. So the scale of our region is often under underappreciated, where we also have about 15 million merchants doing general e-commerce, but also restaurants on our food delivery service. And on that IPO, we're pretty proud to say that it was Indonesia's largest IPO of all time, where we raised over a billion dollars at something like 27, 28 billion dollars in terms of valuation.

Lenny (00:07:50):
And these numbers you shared 2.7 million drivers, 30 billion orders,

Kevin Aluwi (00:07:55):
3 billion.

Lenny (00:07:57):
3 billion. How would that compare to an Uber or Lyft?

Kevin Aluwi (00:07:58):
I don't know what their latest numbers are, but just in terms of the numbers of people and the number of activity, I would place our scale among the largest US companies.

Lenny (00:08:10):
That's pretty wild that there's this company out there that a lot of people didn't know about that is basically of the scale of Uber and Lyft.

Kevin Aluwi (00:08:17):
In terms of volume, I would say that we're up there with Uber globally and definitely larger than Lyft. I don't remember how many drivers are in the US, but we definitely have more drivers in the region than all of America.

Lenny (00:08:35):
Just to kind of check this check box, you said it was a super app. What are all the things that Gojek does? Just whatever you want to share, all the things that you can do.

Kevin Aluwi (00:08:43):
From the point when we had the most services, we had everything from ride hailing to package delivery to food delivery, to grocery deliveries. We had moving services on trucks and vans. We had on demand massages, cleaning services. You could get your hair done on Gojek, you could order movie tickets, you could get a loan, you could pay for things. I think at our peak we had something like near 30 different services all in one app.

Lenny (00:09:18):
I think it's like you're officially a super app if your founder can't even remember all the things that you do right now.

Kevin Aluwi (00:09:25):
Yeah, definitely. I would challenge anyone within the company to be able to name all of our services that we've ever had on the app because it was pretty wild at one point. And I'd love to talk a little bit about my thoughts on super apps at some point during the session because I definitely have some mixed views over it as a product strategy as we've gone through that whole cycle.

Lenny (00:09:54):
It might be actually a good time just to jump into it. I know that I was actually saving that for later, but this might be a good time. And part of the reason I think this is really interesting is if you open up Uber these days, it's like 40 things that they're offering now. Elon at Twitter is talking about turning Twitter into a super app like payments, communication, messaging, all these things. So I think it's a really interesting trend that continues to pop up here in the US and I would absolutely love to hear your perspective on super apps.

Kevin Aluwi (00:10:19):
Okay, I'm going to come off a little strong on this, but I am kind of annoyed at how much it's being mentioned these days. It's really popular in VC-consultant-analyst circles because it sounds really great on a strategy deck because all of the things that are really appealing, we'll talk about lower customer acquisition costs, higher attach rates to different products, talk about higher retention across different services, the ease of cross-selling and upselling. All of these things sound great, but in reality, a lot of those benefits don't pan out. And one probably really good example that I like to reference is that I remember one of our products was mobile phone top up and recharge. In Southeast Asia, a majority of people are on prepaid plans instead of postpaid plans. So everyone basically buys their minutes and their data plans upfront in the beginning of the week or the beginning of the month.

(00:11:27):
So we had a product which was a mobile top-up product. And so the reason I mentioned this specific product as a really illustrative point on super apps is that it's a product that 95% plus of our customers need because they're all on prepaid plans. So it's a very relevant product. And we had our UX research research team actually look into why the engagement in the product wasn't as high as we thought it should be. So one of the questions that our URX team asked our customers was like, "Hey, do you know that you could top up your mobile minutes and by data on the Gojek app?" And only about 40% of our customers, like 30 or 40% of our customers knew that this product existed. And that completely blew our minds because one, it's a product that is relevant for all of our customers.

(00:12:25):
Two, it was literally there on one of the six buttons on the homepage. And I think the insight that we got here was that there kind of needs to be a unifying concept across all of your services within the app for your users to be able to think about your product in a sensible way. And for us, the way that our customers thought about us was that they thought about the driver. And so when we went from ride hailing to package delivery to food delivery, to grocery delivery, customers really understood that. And we didn't have to sell this idea to our customers that you had all of these services under one app because they thought about the Gojek driver. That made sense. You can easily cross sell somebody from a ride hailing customer to a grocery customer or a food delivery customer because they understood the unifying factor there being the driver.

(00:13:24):
But then when you start doing other things that don't have that unifying factor in terms of the concept that a customer has when they think about your service, it starts breaking down. So one other fun UXR insight here was when we launched massage services. So we had at one point though we've shut it down a few years after, we had massage services where you can order a masseuse to come to your place. And a question that many of our customers asked was that, "oh, is the driver going to come into my house and give me a massage?" And for us, that was insane. Of course not, our drivers are not trained masseuses, but that was the question that people asked because they thought like, "oh, this app is an app for these driver related services, so if there was a massage service, I'm assuming it's that same man who's going to give me a massage."

(00:14:17):
And so I think this kind of illustrates the importance of having these unifying concepts that are easy for customers to think about the multiple different services. It's not as simple as just saying, oh, we have a lot of engagement, we have a lot of eyeballs at a service. And then you have a super app that makes sense for customers. And so that whole nirvana of lower CAC, higher retention that are all on these great strategy decks often don't pan out because you kind of have to then resell this idea of like, oh, this is another service and that you can use. And that's a bit of investment that you have to actually put in terms of advertising and customer education that increases those customer acquisition costs.

(00:15:03):
And it also leads to design constraints because there's only so many ways you can display a whole bunch of different services that actually have little to do with each other, which is why when you see super apps today, it's kind of like this giant menu or this giant grid which does limit the design decisions that you can make, which is unfortunate because if you actually, I think it's an unsolved problem at this point.

Lenny (00:15:28):
It's hilarious story about the massage product. Sounds like a lot of startups are going to have some issues scaling to new products and trying to become a super app. I want to shift a little bit and talk about brand. I did a little research on you ahead of this chat. I watched your Marshall graduation and speech and a few other interviews you did, and something that came out of your previous writing and talks is just how much you care about brand and how much value you put into brand. And that you just have a lot of opinions about the importance of brand. And to me and to most people, brand is this really squishy thing and it's hard to know what exactly to do to build your brand, when to prioritize it, how to prioritize it amongst other things you're doing, especially early on. So I'd love to hear your advice for founders that are listening and just like, what should I actually do around brand? What's your advice for how to tactically do something about brand and also just why do you think it's so important?

Kevin Aluwi (00:16:23):
I do agree with you that it is kind of this squishy thing that most people see as an afterthought, may be because it is kind of this squishy thing that it's hard to define, but I'm a very big believer that the two most important things in a consumer business are product and brand in that order. And I don't think I need to sell the idea, especially to your audience. That product is absolutely critical and probably the most important. But brand as an afterthought is definitely one of the areas where I think there's a giant missed opportunity for consumer tech businesses. And I get why we opened the session by talking about the size of the business to get an appreciation of the scale for audience members who might be unfamiliar with us or with the region.

(00:17:16):
But I wish I did have to start there because we actually started as a very scrappy company where we were by far the underfunded player and without brand. We probably would've never gotten to escape velocity beyond that scrappy stage, we've maintained our leadership in Indonesia through a lot of the things that we actually did on the brand side to give you a sense of how scrappy we had to be in competition.

(00:17:52):
For the first six months after launching our app, we had only raised about $2 million and our regional competitor had already raised 250. So they had literally more than a hundred times more capital than we have. So it's easy to talk about what we built as this kind of giant business, but we came from a place where we were seriously underfunded. And I think a big reason why we survived was that we built a great brand for our consumers and for our drivers and for our merchants. And I think that great brands create associations in their customer's minds that transcend the typically transactional or utilitarian one that most people have with businesses and they become part of one's identity.

(00:18:42):
I think some of the best-in-class examples of these are probably all the Apple fanboys and fangirls, Nike sneakerheads, for these individuals, the brand becomes a really big part of their identity and their loyalty towards the products of the company go beyond a relationship that can easily be swayed just through discounts or other more features that other competitors might have. And so I'm a really firm believer of how important this is because you can see it if you step out of the tech bubble for a second, you can see that there's so many great companies out there that really rely on the strength of their brand to build these fantastic businesses and to create great experiences for their customers. And you ask, what are the things that one can do?

(00:19:45):
I think for us, we invested a lot in our brand across multiple areas. And I think one specific area that I think is really important is that you create consistency across all customer touchpoints. And so branding is not just cool logo, cool advertising, fun imagery, but it's really about the impression that a customer or user has with your product and with your business. So having that consistency across all customer touchpoints is really important. So how you write copy and advertising and in the app, how you've even designed the app, but we were the first company of scale to have ads that don't take ourselves too seriously. We make fun of ourselves, we make fun of our cultural observations of Indonesia. And again, to just build this overall field that like, Hey, we get, we are part of the overall culture of Indonesia. And I think even going beyond the more aesthetic or communication oriented investments, we also leaned into cultural artifacts in our product features to really build this brand that is part of day-to-day culture.

(00:21:09):
One of my favorite cultural artifacts is that in Asia it's fairly common to send food as gifts to your loved ones or maybe people you're interested in dating. So people would send over food as gifts to their romantic interests. And so when we launched our food delivery service, a lot of people were actually using it for this, I'm going to send it to my boyfriend or my girlfriend or the person that I'm interested in dating. And so it became this whole cultural phenomenon of sending go-food for these people and we kind of lean into it in our product feature where all of the other players in the market at the time basically only allowed you to deliver food to your home or your office, but we actually created a feature that allowed you to choose a delivery point that was far away from where you were.

(00:22:04):
There was a lot of reasons why other companies didn't allow it at the time because it's like, oh, it might be used for fraud and stuff like that. But we leaned into it, we leaned into it and actually created features that allowed to put your pickup point far away from where your actual location was. And then we just had fun with this whole idea of go-food dating. And so yes, it's kind of part of branding, but thinking about branding beyond just marketing communication but actually be as being relatable and being part of the culture and being sensitive of what that culture is, I think was something that we did really well in the early days that allowed us to continue maintaining leadership in spite of the fact that our competitors had more money, which meant that they could offer more discounts, they could offer more incentives to drivers, but we really kind of lean very hard into being not just a utilitarian commodity, which is what a lot of people would say is the nature of our business to some level of accuracy.

Lenny (00:23:08):
So just to get even more concrete, one takeaway from what you just shared, which is interesting, is the first part of figuring out how to approach your brand is what's the personality of your product for you? You said it was like we're just of the people, we're like you, we're here to help you, make your life easier. And then that informs the copy, the messaging, be a little, I forget how you describe it, but just almost bad grammar and stuff just because it relates more to people and then some of these product launches that connect to that. So maybe if there's anything else you want to add there that'd be interesting. And then what's like, I don't know, one or two moments that most helped build the brand. I know you're kind of famous for having helmets and jackets on the drivers that help spread the Gojek brand. Is there anything else that just like, wow, this was really effective to build this brand that ended up dominating Indonesia?

Kevin Aluwi (00:23:58):
The jackets and helmets piece I think is really, really important for two reasons. One, the more obvious reason, which is that because they were just all over the streets of many cities in Indonesia, people were familiar with the imagery and the names, but I think it's also really important that people saw what was happening. So if we were like, I don't know, an airline and we branded a bunch of people on the streets with our brand, yeah, sure, that might help with brand recall and people might know about the name. But what was really powerful was that when people would be seeing these drivers with their jackets and helmets, they would be seeing passengers on the backseat as they were stuck in traffic. So I'm stuck in traffic and I'm seeing these people whiz past me with with this imagery on them, and immediately I get that association like, oh, I'm stuck in traffic, but I could be out there cutting through traffic on a motorcycle or you see them carrying packages or delivering food, and you immediately get like, oh, these are guys who can deliver food or deliver packages for me.

(00:25:14):
And so it was like this beautiful combination of one just having that imagery and having that visual everywhere as a reminder of the brand. But more importantly, it was also a physical reminder of the service of what we do and of how we can help you. And so looking for these opportunities where again, customers can make that connection between the logo and the colors and the name with actually what the service is, I think are the opportunities that I would say people should look out for. They're admittedly quite rare, which is why in my opinion, the laziest kind of branding tends to be the most popular. Just put your name and your copy on a billboard or on a CPM or CPC campaign. But there are these opportunities I think, on being able to reinforce the value proposition of your business in a way that is beyond just visual recall. And I think that was why that specific anecdote is something I like to talk about because it was really one of those special things that reminded people on why we're here.

Lenny (00:26:37):
Yeah, I think you tweeted that it was one of the most important things you ever did as a company is decide to put these logos on the helmets and jackets. Reminds me of Lyft's pink mustache, which went away, but felt like a really important way for them to differentiate.

Kevin Aluwi (00:26:51):
No, totally.

Lenny (00:26:53):
You talked about how scrappy you've been, and I want to dig into that a little bit more. I think there's like US startup scrappy, and then there's like Gojek scrappy, and it'd be fun to hear maybe a story or two just to illustrate how ridiculously scrappy you were as a company early on, especially.

Kevin Aluwi (00:27:11):
One thing that we did in the early days that was absolutely crazy was that we were one of the pioneering companies, one of the pioneering technology companies in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia. And so we came into a environment where a lot of the things that maybe companies or people in more developed economies take for granted, for example, having electronic or digital payments, that was something that actually didn't really exist that much when we first started. And so we had a problem of actually trying to pay drivers because drivers every day we would be paying out incentives or just having customers pay with their credit cards or their store balance, and then we'd have a challenge and getting our drivers to actually be able to take that money out for their earnings. And in the early days, we actually had cash booths. So we actually had physical spaces with a vault and cash sitting in the vault where drivers can show up that, oh, this is my driver ID and this is the balance that I have with you. Please give me the cash.

(00:28:31):
And so we would have these actual physical locations where there would be lions of drivers essentially taking cash. And we eventually figured this out of like, okay, we'll work with a bank and integrate with an ATM network and all that. But in the early days we just did it ourselves of building essentially a mini at ATM network, which I think even that sounds too fancy of what it was it. Because it was literally a booth with a vault with cash in it. And we had at the time already tens of thousands of drivers all across in Indonesia.

(00:29:10):
Another scrappy story that actually Crystal reminded me of recently that we did was at the time there was a lot of fake driver apps out there because we didn't have all of the security investments that we eventually made, things like code obfuscation and better API security that wouldn't allow for these fraudulent driver apps, these basically third party driver apps to connect to our platform. So there were a lot of these drivers using these third party driver apps that were doing things that... So they were kind of doing unsavory things like stealing driver details, some of them even as bad as financial details so that they can then at some point drain driver funds. And the way that they did it, the way that they convinced drivers to actually use these apps was that they actually added some features that at the time we didn't allow. So things like we wanted drivers to be conscious of what was happening on the app, and so we would actually make sure that drivers would push the accept order button.

(00:30:28):
We made sure that that was the only way that drivers could accept orders, but this app had a functionality that would automatically accept orders as soon as they came in. And so actually it was kind of this interesting situation where they were doing things that were fraudulent and were not safe for the integrity of the platform, but at the same time they were also providing some value to the people who were using them. And so at the time we had to make a decision of like, okay, we need to nip this in the bud and one way that we could have done it, that would've taken time was it really invest in a lot of the technical security aspects of it, but we didn't have the bandwidth to be able to do that. Engineering and security talent is actually super scarce in Southeast Asia at the time, still is today, but at that time extremely scarce.

(00:31:25):
And so we ended up making the decision of actually copying those features. So we actually saw all of these third party fraudulent apps and instead of building a whole system to prevent them from being built or preventing them from working on the platform, we just said, "Hey, let's take their top two or three features and let's build them into our app." And that actually significantly reduced the number of users on these third party apps just by having this mentality of you can't beat them, then join them. And that I would say that wasn't a philosophical decision or a principal decision. Is was actually a decision made out of necessity because we simply couldn't build all the capability to combat these apps at the time?

These are hilarious stories that you had to compete with these ripoff jail broken apps, fraudulent apps, and then you had to build a cash box network all over the country. That's amazing. I knew there would be good stories in this question and I'm glad you delivered. There's also this feeling of within Gojek of just doing the hard thing and you just shared a couple stories of this versus the simple... A lot of startups are like, let's do the simplest thing, feels like you guys lean into the hard thing. Why is that? Where'd that come from? And then is there any other story of something that you did that was like, we'll do it the hard way?

Kevin Aluwi (00:33:41):
I really don't like the idea of moats. Again, one of the concepts that gets thrown out a lot by strategy type folks of what's the moat of your business or your product? And usually people are looking for an answer like, oh, look at this capability or look at this feature or look at this distribution partner or all of those kind of things. And I don't believe that any moats are durable over time. Eventually with enough time all moats can be crossed. And I think one so-called moat that doesn't get talked about enough is the fact that you're able to do hard things because hard things are hard and just simply doing things that are hard, as long as they create value to your customers, actually is a position that makes it harder for your competitors to be able to win over your customers because it's hard to do those things.

(00:34:52):
And probably another example of doing something that sounds very difficult was that in the early days of Gojek, there was a lot of resistance to our services and one of the forms of that resistance, one of the more most common form of that resistance in the early days was actually by motorcycle taxi mafia. So you would have these areas that are essentially controlled through violence by specific area mafia. And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them to just physical altercations, literally mobs of people getting into these brawls. And there was a lot of these kind of things that actually happened in the streets of Jakarta at the time. And I think it would've been easy for us to say, "Hey, they're all contractors, they're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out."

(00:36:14):
But instead we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help these situations, to help our drivers in those situations, to help extract them out of these sticky situations. And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time until it became common to have Gojek drivers do all of these things across cities. We actually ran this very operation intensive thing just to make sure that our drivers could be as safe as possible and it showed our commitment to the driver community, it showed our commitment that we cared. And again, going back to that earlier point around having that branding association, drivers knew that, hey, we weren't just a platform that didn't care. We actually cared about their safety and that helped build that goodwill even as competitors started coming in and paying more money, we still had a lot of loyalty within the driver community because of things like that.

Lenny (00:37:30):
How did you actually have a security person on a motorcycle? Were they pretending to be the rider and then just get out and punch them in the face?

Kevin Aluwi (00:37:39):
A minority of situations were like that, but a lot of that was just like, having an on-call service where they could just dial a number and somebody within a 5-10 minute distance would actually show up. And so we would have these patrols effectively in specific hotspots where if there was a situation brewing that they would instantly or almost instantly show up to the site and help diffuse it.

Lenny (00:38:13):
I love that you have this super app that's doing all these things for people. Plus within the company you've built all these mini businesses, like a whole bank to pay people, private security company. There's probably some other... Crystal shared a story of you guys rented out a stadium for drivers to collect all the drivers and give them phones.

Kevin Aluwi (00:38:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:38:34):
Okay. This is great.

Kevin Aluwi (00:38:34):
Yeah, that I think is probably one of the hallmarks of this region in general where I have no doubt that what we were building and what we are today is a technology company, but I do think that in the early days you do have to be a lot more operations heavy. And then I think that lends to that scrappiness because there are a lot of things that to solve elegantly and technically will take a lot of time and just kind of over focusing on those type of solutions I think would be doing your customers a disservice because there are opportunities to make things a lot better just through probably more innovation in operations to kind of kickstart things until you have the more elegant, scalable, technical or product solution.

Lenny (00:39:38):
That reminds me that at Gojek, you held tons of different roles throughout the time you were there. You were obviously co-founder, your Co-CEO at one point, defacto CPO at one point, CIO, CFO. I heard that you were writing like push notification copy, became a driver at one point just to keep things running. So feels like another good example of exactly what you're talking about of just doing the hard thing in the operational component.

Kevin Aluwi (00:40:05):
I mean, yes, actually I did have a stint as an amateur performance marketer in the early days of Gojek. I would write copy, I would upload ads onto Facebook and Google and try and do my best in optimizing our online marketing spend. But I think I did all of those things, not because I wanted to be scrappy necessarily, but I do think that as, and this is probably most relevant for founders, less for executives, but I think as a founder, I do think it's really important to understand the work that needs to be done in order to see what excellence looks like. And for us, again, we came from an ecosystem where the availability of experienced talent was relatively low. And so for me it was very hard to be able to say, "oh, let's hire person X from organization Y with job description Z," and we know that they probably can deliver because again, the talent availability was really low.

(00:41:16):
And so a lot of times I felt like I needed to understand, okay, what is this job? What exactly does it entail is, and seeing how bad I am at it allowed me to understand what good looked like. And so I held a lot of those roles just because I wanted to understand every part of the business as best as I could in order to then find somebody who could do it orders of magnitude better than myself. I would say that is true for all of these roles except for being a driver. I think being a driver, I wasn't trying to understand what excellence as a driver look like. Obviously the drivers do a really challenging job and I think I just wanted to understand what that role was like to build a lot more empathy towards the job and make sure that our product was catered towards what those needs were.

(00:42:12):
So when we first launched our car ride hailing services, I think I was the first actual driver on the app and I would every now and then be a driver. And I remember the early days when I actually picked up a customer. It was this lady and she put in her destination as a mall. And so I went to this house and I knew that, okay, I needed to drive to this mall, but then this lady comes out with this giant bag and so I had to hop out the car, take this giant bag, put it in my trunk, and then off we went. And in the middle of the drive she's like, "Hey, I need to drop off and do my laundry on the way to the mall." And I just had to, "okay, cool." We took a detour, I lugged this giant bag out of our trunk and helped this lady do her laundry.

(00:43:17):
And then we went to the mall and I got very little money out of that experience and it wasn't instant, but this is eventually what led to, I think a lot of the support I gave to our driver teams when they were pushing for, Hey, we need more waiting fees, we need to add multiple stops in order to make sure that hey, a lot of this extra work was actually compensated. And it was something that I obviously experienced personally and it was something that I definitely was excited about as a set of product features and principles when it came to building our driver app.

Lenny (00:43:58):
It feels like having to do that ends up being a feature as you said, that you actually experienced a lot of these challenges and you said the really good point about knowing what to hire and what these people are going to actually do.

Kevin Aluwi (00:44:07):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:07):
That's interesting how that often turns into a good thing. I know you also have a pretty interesting journey into tech. What can you share around that?

Kevin Aluwi (00:44:18):
So I am basically a failed finance professional. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my life. And in 2005, which is when I entered college, the hot sexy thing to do was finance. And I guess that was what I wanted to do. And I went, studied finance, and then the crash of 2008 happened and I graduated 2009, so it's probably the worst time to try and be a finance professional. And so I went through a really challenging time there, but eventually I got a job at a boutique investment banking firm. And that was, I thought like, okay, now I was set for life. I got the job that I wanted. I'm working in finance. But then long story short, I was not very good. I was not very good. My bosses thought I was underperforming. I didn't feel like I was performing, and I kind of left that field that I thought I built my entire, I guess future dreams and identity around.

(00:45:32):
And after I did that, I decided to take a bet in Indonesian technology because when all of this was happening was around 2010, 2011, and it was starting to see the development of the current technology giants in the US at the time. And I thought that it would be pretty cool if Indonesia ever had a technology industry to be part of it at the ground floor. And so I moved back in 2011 and it was super early. It was really early at the time where the level of talent, the level of funding, the level of product market fit, the number of people who transacted on the internet was also still super low. People still saw the internet as a place for chat apps and social media. And so the level of belief that people had in the space at that time was pretty low.

(00:46:30):
People didn't think that real businesses and real valuable products could be built, especially be built locally. And so taking that bet was something that I think it really panned out for us to be really early in the space, which today has become very vibrant to the scene. Southeast Asia has become, I think one of the most exciting spaces in technology in the world to date. But at the time it wasn't obvious. And being able to see that development I think was something that was really important to me because it really shows you what's possible in a very short time. And I think it's something that probably people in technology in the US can relate to, the people who've been working in this space for like 20, 30 years. But being able to see those early days for me was just really valuable and I think was an experience that I definitely cherish.

Lenny (00:47:31):
It's really hard to just build a company outside of Silicon Valley, and it was even harder back then. COVID and remote work almost made it the easiest it's ever been.

Kevin Aluwi (00:47:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:47:40):
Sounds like a lot of the fact that you were so far away from the Bay Area informed the way that you built this company, the scrappiness that you talked about. I'm curious if you have any advice for a founder who's trying to build a company now outside of, say the Bay Area or just US in general based on your experience.

Kevin Aluwi (00:47:58):
Yeah, look, it was super hard back then. It was particularly hard because Indonesia is such a valuable market, Indonesia and the rest, I would say primarily Indonesia just because of its scale. But I think overall Southeast Asia was just such a valuable market and it was interesting for global companies to want to win it. So we competed with global and regional companies, but the local talent and funding ecosystems were really underdeveloped. So that challenge of having to compete with the best in the world for customers in the market while also not having all of the resources available within the market to be able to build products and companies that can compete was I would say one of the most challenging parts of building probably in markets that are atypical or outside of Silicon Valley and maybe some of the other technology centers in the world like China and India.

(00:49:01):
So some of my learnings probably there that I would take going forward is I think we talked a lot about being scrappy. In the beginning, we were a lot more ops-heavy than tech-heavy. And doing the things that don't scale through other means I think is definitely something that is absolutely necessary if you're building outside of these main technology hubs. Another thing I would say is you need to get good at remote work really early. And I think today that's kind of become a lot more prevalent as more and more people have experience with remote work. For us, we built an engineering center in Bangalore in 2015, and this allowed us to compete a lot better with the global giants because we had access to a really deep talent market in India at the time, but we were really early in this whole remote work thing because it wasn't common for people in our region, but also globally to have so much talent concentration outside of headquarters.

(00:50:14):
And I do believe that companies who want to compete against world class competitors outside of these technology centers like Silicon Valley need to become good at remote work really fast because getting that talent probably means having offices or individuals who are outside of your home market or your headquarters. And probably the final I would say tip here is don't just copy, because Gojek was not an Uber clone, even though that was kind of how some investors or analysts talk about us, we were focused on a solution that was uniquely an Indonesian phenomenon, the motorcycle taxi driver. And this led to both product and branding innovation. On the product side, we were an on-demand super app because we saw that a human being on a motorcycle could do a lot of things. And so we built a product around that idea and hence we ended up with a super app even before super apps were really a thing.

(00:51:24):
And then that branding point that we talked about a little earlier about giving our drivers jackets and helmets so people could see them zip around town, which actually doesn't make sense if you're a car ride hailing service because it's not very easy to brand a car and the drivers are inside the car. But all of our competitors at the time when they first entered the motorcycle ride hailing space didn't brand their drivers because they came from a car-centric view. And so again, understanding your unique market dynamics is also really important if you're building outside of these technology centers.

Lenny (00:52:10):
We've been chatting about Indonesia and Southeast Asia. I'd love to hear just what should people know about that market? We've chatted about what you guys have built and a few other companies here and there, but what companies should people be aware of what's happening? What's the latest, what's exciting?

Kevin Aluwi (00:52:24):
Yeah, I think specifically Indonesia, most people don't know that Indonesia is the fourth largest country in the world and that Southeast Asia holds almost 10% of the world's population. But beyond the macro picture, I think also we've experienced a pretty unique level of pace of adoption for products with great product market fit. So products with great product market fit grow tremendously fast in this part of the world. And in 2015, for example, when we launched our app, we grew more than a hundred percent month on month for the first 16, 18 months. So we more than doubled every month for more than a year.

Lenny (00:53:16):
That is insane. I've never heard of that.

Kevin Aluwi (00:53:19):
No, and our investors at the time, Sequoia is one of our investors at the time, told us that this was the craziest growth story that they've ever heard of in the world. And I wouldn't say because of our necessarily our brilliance, it was a combination of how in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia, there are a lot of these things that are obviously broken and could be improved with better technology and better products. But we also have in this region a very young population who are excited to try new things. And so if you find a solution that really resonates with a lot of these common day-to-day problems, the adoption curve is just absolutely insane. And I think it's one of the things that are definitely unique to developing regions like this one.

(00:54:14):
One company that's really interesting for example, just to give a flavor of the type of seemingly off the wall product or company being built in this part of the world, there's a company called eFishery, and what they do is they basically create a closed loop ecosystem for fish farmers in currently, I think they're only operational Indonesia or they're recently expanding beyond Indonesia.

(00:54:45):
They help farmers feed their fish through this IOT smart device that helps measure the amount of fish feed that needs to go into the ponds, but they also then help farmers do things that get financing and also sell their produce out to local or even regional or global markets. And it's a company doing something like a quarter billion dollars in revenue and it's profitable and it's basically a fish farmer, a close loop ecosystem. And it's pretty wild that something like this exists, but it does speak to, I think again earlier what I said earlier about the hunger that the population have for better solutions. And if you can find these better solutions, you can really build companies of the very meaningful scale very, very quickly.

Lenny (00:55:42):
So at this point, you've stepped down a CEO, you've stepped down from the board, what's next and how does it feel?

Kevin Aluwi (00:55:50):
Yeah, I'm still on this journey honestly, of how does it feel. I think that building Gojek is by far the most important professional experience and frankly, one of the most important life experiences I've had. It's made me a way better person actually. And now that I've stepped away, I am not as bored or as aimless as people would expect after having such a kind of all-consuming thing be part of my life experience.

(00:56:37):
What's next? Honestly, Lenny, I don't know. I don't have a plan at this stage. I do some angel investing on the side. I work with other founders to be able to maybe just share some of these experiences that I shared today and just figuring out what makes me happy and what are the kind activities that I find rewarding. I don't know, maybe I'll start another company at some point. I think that's my default, but I think right now I'm just taking things easy and trying to figure out another problem I guess, that I could be obsessed about.

Lenny (00:57:25):
You've earned that time to explore and look for new problems. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kevin Aluwi (00:57:33):
No Lenny. I think we've covered a lot today, and I just wanted to thank you for the time.

Lenny (00:57:41):
Amazing. It's absolutely my pleasure. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Kevin Aluwi (00:57:48):
Yes, let's go.

Lenny (00:57:50):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kevin Aluwi (00:57:54):
What You Do Is Who You Are. I think that was the second most popular Ben Horowitz's book, but I'm really obsessed with building interesting and engaging cultures, so I think that's one. Another is a classic marketing book. Again, we talked a lot about branding today, so there's this book called How Brands Grow by Byron Sharp. I don't agree necessarily with everything in it, but I do think that it's a great primer on how to think about branding and marketing.

Lenny (00:58:25):
Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:27):
Favorite recent movie, The Menu and favorite recent TV show? Netflix show is a Cyberpunk 2077 Edge Runners.

Lenny (00:58:38):
Oh, wow. I haven't heard of that one.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:39):
Oh, you should check it out. It's super cool.

Lenny (00:58:42):
I'll go check it out.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:43):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:43):
Favorite interview question that you like to ask.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:46):
Tell me about a subject or activity you've been obsessed with for a long time.

Lenny (00:58:51):
What do you look for in an answer that's like, okay, this is good.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:54):
I want somebody to basically almost pitch to me an obsession they have than makes me interested in knowing more into that subject. The more obscure, the better and the more passionate they are about an obscure thing, even better. And I think it shows people's capability to be really passionate about something and sell something and think about something in a very structured and detailed way.

Lenny (00:59:25):
What are some products that you love and have recently discovered?

Kevin Aluwi (00:59:30):
Two products, I think right now that I've found absolutely delightful. One is the ARC Browser. I know that it's gaining a lot of traction out there, but I'm a very chronic tab hoarder. My Chrome tabs are just all over the place, and I love that they've figured out I would say the best approach to kind of tab management, and there's just a ton of little delightful, awesome design details in the app that I think is just really cool. And it's a browser. When's the last time there was a really cool browser that came out? So I also love the ambition that the company has.

(01:00:09):
Second product, Steam Deck. I'm a huge gamer, and I think it is probably, I would say the best game platform to actually build on the vision of truly portable mobile gaming.

Lenny (01:00:25):
I love your point with ARC for tab hoarders. I also used to have a lot of tabs and I love it just auto deletes stuff and just disappear, and it forces you to lose your tabs and it works out surprisingly.

Kevin Aluwi (01:00:38):
Final question.

Lenny (01:00:38):
I'm curious what comes up for this one? What's something you've recently changed or that you've heard of someone at Gojek recently changed in their product development process that was maybe minor, that had a tremendous impact on the team's ability to execute.

Kevin Aluwi (01:00:53):
One relatively minor thing that I thought had a lot of impact with execution is being very clear that whoever is accountable for the results should also be the decider. I found that a lot of literature out there says that product teams should be this communal best ideas come from everywhere group, which I think is well-intentioned and absolutely everyone should contribute ideas, but I think not having it be super clear who is accountable and who is deciding often slows down execution a lot. And I think when we switch to making it really clear that who was the decider for any kind of product development process, I think our execution definitely improved significantly.

Lenny (01:01:37):
Amazing. Kevin, thank you so much for being here. Gojek is such an interesting and important story, and I feel like most founders can learn something from the story, so I was really excited to bring you on and to hear a lot of these wild stories that you shared. Two final questions. Where can folks find your line if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Kevin Aluwi (01:01:57):
I am @kaluwi on Twitter. That's also my email, kaluwi@gmail.com. I'll always be happy to chat about Gojek or just generally anything technology related. Again, I have nothing I'm working on at the moment, so I just would love to jam with cool people.

Lenny (01:02:22):
Amazing. Thank you again for being here.

Kevin Aluwi (01:02:25):
Thanks, Lenny.

## Transcript

Kevin Weil (00:00:00):
The AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life, and when you actually get that in your head, it's kind of wild. Everywhere I've ever worked before this, you kind of know what technology you're building on, but that's not true at all with AI. Every two months, computers can do something they've never been able to do before and you need to completely think differently about what you're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
You're chief product officer of maybe the most important company in the world right now. I want to chat about what it's just like to be inside the center of the storm.

Kevin Weil (00:00:29):
Our general mindset is in two months, there's going to be a better model and it's going to blow away whatever the current set of limitations are. And we say this to developers too. If you're building and the product that you're building is kind of right on the edge of the capabilities of the models, keep going because you're doing something right. Give it another couple months and the models are going to be great, and suddenly the product that you have that just barely worked is really going to sing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
Famously, you led this project at Facebook called Libra.

Kevin Weil (00:00:56):
Libra is probably the biggest disappointment of my career. It fundamentally disappoints me that this doesn't exist in the world today because the world would be a better place if we'd been able to ship that product. We tried to launch a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger. I would be able to send you 50 cents in WhatsApp for free. It should exist. To be honest, the current administration is super friendly to crypto. Facebook's reputation is in a very different place. Maybe they should go build it now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Kevin Weil. Kevin is chief product officer at OpenAI, which is maybe the most important and most impactful company in the world right now, being at the forefront of AI and AGI and maybe someday super intelligence. He was previously head of product at Instagram and Twitter. He was co-creator of the Libra Cryptocurrency at Facebook, which we chat about. He's also on the boards of Planet and Strava and the Black Product Managers Network and the Nature Conservancy. He's also just a really good guy and he has so much wisdom to share. We chat about how OpenAI operates, implications of AI and how we will all work and build product, which markets within the AI ecosystem, companies like OpenAI won't likely go after and thus are good places for startups to own. Also, why learning the craft of writing evals is quickly becoming a core skill for product builders, what skills will matter most in an AI era and what he's teaching his kids to focus on and so much more.

Kevin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kevin Weil (00:05:23):
Thank you so much for having me. We've been talking about doing this forever and we made it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):
We did it. I can't imagine how insane your life is, so I really appreciate that you made time for this and we're actually recording this the week that you guys launched your new image model, which is a happy coincidence. My entire social feed is filled with ghiblifications of everyone's life and family photos and everything, so good job.

Kevin Weil (00:05:45):
Yep, mine too. My wife, Elizabeth, sent me one of hers, so I'm right there with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
Let me just ask, did you guys expect this kind of reaction? It feels like this is the most viral thing that's happened in AI, which a high bar since, I don't know, ChatGPT launched. Just like, did you guys expect it to go this well? What does it feel like internally?

Kevin Weil (00:06:04):
There have been a handful of times in my career when you're working on a product internally and the internal usage just explodes. This was true by the way when we were building stories at Instagram. More than anything else in my career, we could feel it was going to work because we were all using it internally and we'd go away for a weekend. Before it launched we were all using it and we'd come back after a weekend and we would know what was going on and be like, "Oh, hey, I saw you were at that camping trip, how was that?" You were like, "Man, this thing really works." ImageGen was definitely one of those, so we'd been playing with it for, I don't know, a couple months and when it first went live internally to the company, there was kind of a little gallery where you could generate your own, you could also see what everyone else was generating and it was just nonstop buzz. So yeah, we had a sense that this was going to be a lot of fun for people to play with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):
That's really cool. That should be a measure of just confidence into something going well that you're launching is internally everyone's going crazy for it.

Kevin Weil (00:07:05):
Yeah. Especially social things because you have a very tight network as a company socially, so you know each other and you're experts in your product hopefully. And so there's some sense in which if you're doing something social and it's not taking off internally, you might question what you're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:23):
Yeah, and by the way, the Ghibli thing, is that something you guys seeded or how did that even start? Was that an intentional example?

Kevin Weil (00:07:29):
I think it's just the style people love and the model is really capable at emulating style or understanding what... It's very good at instruction following. That's actually something that I think people... I'm starting to see people discover with it, but you can do very complex things. You can give it two images, one is your living room and the other is a whole bunch of photos or memorabilia or things you want and you say, "Tell me how you would arrange these things." Or you can say, "I'd like you to show me what this will look like if you put this over here and this thing to the right of that and this one to the left of this, but under that one." And the model actually will understand all of that and do it. It's incredibly powerful. So I'm just excited about all the different things people are going to figure out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
Yeah. All right. Well, good job. Good job team OpenAI. Let's get serious here and let's zoom out a little bit. The way I see it is you're chief product officer of maybe the most important company in the world right now. Just not to set the bar too high, but you guys are ushering in AI, AGI at some point, super intelligence at some point. No big deal. I have more questions for you than I've had for any other guest. Actually put out a call-out on Twitter and LinkedIn and my community just like what would you want to ask Kevin? And I had over 300 well-formed questions and we're going to go through every single one. So let's just get started. I'm just joking.

Kevin Weil (00:08:45):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:46):
I picked out the best and there's a lot of stuff I'm really curious about.

Kevin Weil (00:08:48):
Well, it's 1 PM here. It doesn't get dark for a while, so let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:53):
Okay, here we go. Okay, so first of all, I'm just going to take notes here. When is AGI launching? When in December?

Kevin Weil (00:08:58):
I mean, we just launched a good ImageGen model. Does that count?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:03):
It's getting there. It's getting there.

Kevin Weil (00:09:05):
There's this quote I love, which is "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet" because once it's been done, when it kind of works, then you call it machine learning, and once it's kind of ubiquitous and it's everywhere, then it's just an algorithm. So I've always loved that we call things AI when they still don't quite work and then by the time it's like an AI algorithm that's recommending you follow, oh, that's just an algorithm, but this new thing, like self-driving cars, that's it. I think to some degree we're always going to be there and the next thing is always going to be AI and the current thing that we use every day and is just a part of our lives, that's an algorithm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
It's so interesting because in the Bay Area you see self-driving cars driving around and it's so normal now when four years ago and three years ago, you would've seen this and you'd be like, "Holy shit, what is... We're in the future." And now we're just so take it for granted.

Kevin Weil (00:10:01):
I mean there's something like that with everything. If I showed you... When GPT-3 launched, I wasn't at OpenAI then. I was just a user, but it was mind-blowing. And if I gave you GPT-3 now I just plugged that into ChatGPT for you and you started using it, you'd be like, "What is this thing?" It's like mess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):
Flop, flop.

Kevin Weil (00:10:24):
I had the same experience when I first got into a Waymo, your very first ride, at least my very first ride, my first 10 seconds in a Waymo, it starts driving and you're like, "Oh my God, watch out for that bike." You're holding onto whatever you can. And then five minutes in, you've calmed down and you realize that you're getting driven around the city without a driver and it's working. You're just like, "Oh my God, I am living in the future right now." And then another 10 minutes, you're bored, you're doing email on your phone, answering Slack messages, and suddenly this miracle of human invention is just an expected part of your life from then on. And there is really something in the way that we all are adapting to AI that's kind of like that. These miraculous things happen and computers can do something they've never been able to do before and it blows our mind collectively for a week and then we're like, oh, yeah. Oh, now it's just machine learning on its way to being an algorithm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):
The craziest thing about what you just shared actually is, I don't know, ChatGPT, which is now feels terrible. 3.5 was a couple years ago, and imagine what life will be like in a couple years from now. We're going to get to that, where things are going, what you think is going to be the next big leap. But I want to start with the beginning of your journey at OpenAI. So you worked at Twitter, you worked at Facebook, you worked at Planet, Instagram. At some point you got recruited to go and come work at OpenAI. I'm curious just what that story was like of the recruiting process of joining OpenAI as CPO. Is there any fun stories there?

Kevin Weil (00:12:01):
If I'm remembering the timeline right, we communicated at Planet I was leaving and I was planning to just go take some time. I wasn't going to stop working, but I was also happy to take the summer. This was maybe April or something. I was like, cool, I'm going to have the summer with my kids. We're going to go to Tahoe or something and I'll actually get to hang out rather than what I usually do going up and down and all that. And then Sam and I had known each other lightly for a bunch of years and he's always involved in so many interesting things like companies building fusion and all these things. So he'd always been somebody that I would call occasionally if I was starting to think about my next thing because I like working on big tech forward, sort of next wave kind of things.

(00:12:49):
And so I called him and I think Vinod also helped to put us in touch again. And this time it wasn't like, "Oh, you should go talk to these guys working on fusion." He said, "Actually, we're thinking about something, you should come talk to us." I was like, "Okay, that sounds amazing. Let's do it." And it goes really fast, really, really fast. I met most of the management team in a brief period of time, a few days, and they were telling me, 'Look, we're basically going to move as fast as we want to move. And if you talk to everyone, everyone likes you, you're ready to go." Sam came over for dinner and we had a great evening together just talking about OpenAI in the future and getting to know each other better. And at the end I was like, I was going to go in the next day for a bigger round of interviews and Sam was saying, "Hey, it's going really well. We're really excited."

(00:13:52):
And I said, "Cool. So how do I think about tomorrow?" And he said, "Oh, you'll be fine. Don't worry about it. And if it goes well, we're basically there." And so I go in the next day, meet a bunch of people, have a great time. I really enjoyed everybody I met with. In any interview, you can always second guess yourself like, oh, I shouldn't have said that thing or that thing I gave a bad answer on I wish I could redo, but I came away feeling like I think that went pretty well. And I was expecting to hear that weekend basically because they sort of set expectations as soon as if this goes well, we're ready to go. And I didn't hear anything. And then it was like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I still didn't hear anything and I reached out to folks on the OpenAI side a couple of times, still nothing.

(00:14:45):
And I was like, "Oh my God, I screwed it up. I don't know where I screwed it up, but I totally screwed it up. I can't believe it." And I was going back to Elizabeth, my wife and being like, "What did I do? Where do you think I..." Getting all crazy about it and then it's still nothing. And finally it was like nine days later, they finally got back to me and it turned out there was a bunch of stuff happening internally and this, that and the other thing, and there's just a million things happening. And they finally were like, "Oh yeah, that went well. Let's do this." And I was like, "Oh, okay, cool, let's do it." But it was nine days of agony and they were just super busy on some internal stuff and there I was fretting every single day and re-going over every line of our interview process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):
It makes me think about when you're dating someone and you've texted them and you're not hearing anything back, you assume something is wrong.

Kevin Weil (00:15:40):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:41):
They might just be busy.

Kevin Weil (00:15:42):
I have a hard time about it still.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:47):
That's wild. I love that it worked out. And I guess the lesson there is don't jump to conclusions.

Kevin Weil (00:15:55):
Yeah. Have a little bit of chill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:59):
Speaking of that, I want to chat about what it's just like to be inside the center of the storm. Again, you work at a lot of, let's say traditional companies even though they're not that traditional, Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and Planet, and now you work at OpenAI. I'm curious, what is most different about how things work in your day-to-day life at OpenAI?

Kevin Weil (00:16:19):
I think it's probably the pace. Maybe it's two things. One is it's the pace. The second is everywhere I've ever worked before this, you kind of know what technology you're building on. So you spend your time thinking about what problems are you solving? Who are you building for? How are you going to make their lives better? How are you going to... Is this a big enough problem that you're going to be able to change habits? Do people care about this problem being solved? All those good product things. But the stuff that you're building on is kind of fixed. You're talking about databases and things and I bet the database you used this year is probably 5% better than the database you used two years ago, but that's not true at all with AI. It's like every two months computers can do something they've never been able to do before and you need to completely think differently about what you're doing.

(00:17:10):
There's something fundamentally interesting about that makes life fun here. There's also something we will maybe talk about evals later, but it also really, in this world of... Everything we're used to with computers is about giving a computer very defined inputs. If you look at Instagram for example, there are buttons that do specific things and you know what they do. And then when you give a computer defined inputs, you get very defined outputs. You're confident that if you do the same thing three times, you're going to get the same output three times. LLMs are completely different than that. They're good at fuzzy subtle inputs. Then all the nuances of human language and communication, they're pretty good at. And also they don't really give you the same answer. You probably get spiritually the same answer for the same question, but it's certainly not the same set of words every time. And so you're much more, it's fuzzier inputs and fuzzier outputs. And when you're building products, it really matters whether there's some use case that you're trying to build around.

(00:18:16):
If the model gets it right 60% of the time, you build a very different product than if the model gets it right 95% of the time versus if the model gets it right 99.5% of the time. And so there's also something that you have to get really into the weeds on your use case and the evals and things like that in order to understand the right kind of product to build. So that is just fundamentally different. If your database works once, it works every time. And that's not true in this world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
Let's actually follow this thread on evals. I definitely wanted to talk about this. We had this legendary panel at the Lenny & Friends Summit. It was you and Mike Krieger and Sarah Guo moderating.

Kevin Weil (00:18:58):
That was fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
So fun. The thing that I heard that kind of stuck with people from that panel was a comment you made where you said that writing evals is going to become a core skill for product managers, and I feel like that probably applies further than just product managers. A lot of people know what evals are. A lot of people have no idea what I'm talking about. So could you just briefly explain what is an eval and then just why do you think this is going to be so important for people building products in the future?

Kevin Weil (00:19:23):
Yeah, sure. I think the easiest way to think about it is almost like a quiz for a model, a test to gauge how well it knows a certain set of subject material or how good it is at responding to a certain set of questions. So in the same way you take a calculus class and then you have calculus tests that see if you've learned what you're supposed to learn. You have evals that test how good is the model at creative writing? How good is the model at graduate level science? How good is the model at competitive coding? And so you have these set of evals that basically perform as benchmarks for how smart or capable the model is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:04):
Is it a simple way to think about it, like unit tests for model?

Kevin Weil (00:20:07):
Yeah, unit tests, tests in general for models. Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:10):
Great, great. Okay. And then why is this so important for people that don't totally understand what the hell's going on here with evals? Why is this so key to building AI products?

Kevin Weil (00:20:20):
Well, it gets back to what I was saying. You need to know whether your model is going to... There are certain things that models will get right. 99.95% of the time and you can just be confident. There are things that they're going to be 95% right on and things they're going to be 60% right on. If the model's 60% right on something, you're going to need to build your product totally differently. And by the way, these things aren't static either. So a big part of evals is if you know you're building for some use case. So let's take our deep research product, which is one of my favorite things that we've released maybe ever. The idea is with deep research for people who haven't used it, you can give ChatGPT now an arbitrarily complex query. It's not about returning you an answer from a search query, which we can also do.

(00:21:10):
It's here's a thing that if you were going to answer it yourself, you'd go off and do two hours of reading on the web and then you might need to read some papers and then you would come back and start writing up your thoughts and realize you had some gaps in your thinking. So you go out and do more research. It might take you a week to write some 20 page answer to this question. You can let ChatGPT just like chug for you for 25, 30 minutes. It's not the immediate answers you're used to, but it might go work for 25, 30 minutes and do work that would've taken you a week. So as we were building that product, we were designing evals at the same time as we were thinking about how this product was going to work and we were trying to go through hero use cases.

(00:21:57):
Here's a question you want to be able to ask. Here's an amazing answer for that question. And then turning those into evals and then hill climbing on those evals. So it's not just that the model is static and we hope it does okay on a certain set of things, you can teach the model. You can make this a continuous learning process. And so as we were fine-tuning our model for deep research to be able to answer these things, we were able to test is it getting better on these evals that we said were important measures of how the product was working? And it's when you start seeing that and you start seeing performance on evals going up, you start saying, "Okay, I think we have a product here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):
You made a kind of a comment along these same lines around evals that AI is almost capped in how amazing it can be by how good we are at evals. Does that resonate? Any more thoughts along those lines?

Kevin Weil (00:22:48):
I mean, these models are their intelligences and intelligence is so fundamentally multidimensional so you can talk about a model being amazing at competitive coding, which may not be the same as that model being great at front-end coding-

Kevin Weil (00:23:00):
... may not be the same as that model being great at front-end coding or back-end coding or taking a whole bunch of code that's written in COBOL and turning it into Python. And that's just within the software engineering world. So I think there's a sense in which you can think of these models as incredibly smart, very factually aware intelligences, but still most of the world's data, knowledge, process is not public. It's behind the walls of companies or governments or other things. And same way, if you were going to join a company, you would spend your first two weeks onboarding. You'd be learning the company-specific processes. You'd get access to company-specific data. The models are smart enough, you can teach them anything, but they need to have the raw data to learn from.

(00:23:58):
So there's a sense in which I think the future is really going to be incredibly smart, broad-based models that are fine-tuned and tailored with company-specific or use case-specific data so that they perform really well on company-specific, or use case-specific things. And you're going to measure that with custom evals. So what I was referring to is just like these models are really smart, you need to still teach them things if the data's not in their training set, and there's a huge amount of use cases that are not going to be in their training set because they're relevant to one industry or one company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):
I'm just going to keep following the thread that you're leading us down, but I'm going to come back because I have more questions around some of these things. So you came to a space that I think a lot of AI founders are thinking about is just, where's OpenAI not going to come squash me in the future? Or one of the other foundational models. So it's unclear to a lot of people just like, "Should I build a startup in this space or not?" Is there any advice you have or any guidance for where you think OpenAI, or just foundational models in general likely won't go and where you have an opportunity to build a company?

Kevin Weil (00:25:10):
So this is something that Ev Williams used to say back at Twitter that's always stuck with me, which is, "No matter how big your company gets, no matter how incredible the people are, there are way more smart people outside your walls than there are inside your walls." And that's why we are so focused on building a great API. We have 3 million developers using our API. No matter how ambitious we are, how big we grow, by the way, we don't want to grow super big, there are so many use cases, places in the world where AI can fundamentally make our lives better. We're not going to have the people. We're not going to have the know-how to build most of these things.

(00:25:55):
And I think, like I was saying, the data is industry-specific, use case-specific, behind certain company walls, things like that. And there are immense opportunities in every industry and every vertical in the world to go build AI-based products that improve upon the state of the art. And there's just no way we could ever do that ourselves. We don't want to. We if we did want to, and we're really excited to power that for 3 million-plus developers and way more in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):
Coming back to your earlier point about the tech changing constantly and getting faster, not exactly knowing what you'll have by the time you launch something in terms of the power, the model. I'm curious what allows you to ship quickly and consistently in such great stuff? And it sounds like one answer is bottoms-up empowered teams versus a very top-down roadmap that's planned out for a quarter. What are some of those things that allow you to ship such great stuff so often, so quickly?

Kevin Weil (00:26:53):
Yeah. I mean, we try and have a sense of where we're trying to go, point ourselves in a direction so that we have some rough sense of alignment. Thematically, I don't for second, and we do quarterly roadmapping. We laid out a year-long strategy. I don't for a second believe that what we write down in these documents is what we're going to actually ship three months from now, let alone six or nine. But that's okay. I think it's like an Eisenhower quote, "Plans are useless. Planning is helpful," which I totally subscribe to, especially in this world. It's really valuable. If you think about quarterly road roadmapping for example, it's really valuable to have a moment where you stop and go, "Okay. What did we do? What worked? What went well? What didn't go well? What did we learn and now what do we think we're going to do next?"

(00:27:44):
And by the way, everybody has some dependencies. You need the infrastructure team to do the following things, partnership with research here. So you want to have a second to check your dependencies, make sure you're good to go and then start executing. We try and keep that really lightweight because it's not going to be right. We're going to throw it out halfway because we will have learned new things. So the moment of planning is helpful even if it's only partially.

(00:28:12):
So I think just expecting that you're going to be super agile and that there's no sense writing a three month roadmap, let alone a year long roadmap because the technology's changing underneath you so quickly. We really do try and go very strongly bottoms up, subject to our overall directional alignment. We have great people. We have engineers and PMs and designers and researchers who are passionate about the products they're building and have strong opinions about them and are also the ones building them. So they have a real sense of what the capabilities are too, which is super important.

(00:28:49):
So I think you want to be more bottoms up in this way. So we operate that way. We are happy making mistakes. We make mistakes all the time. It's one of the things I really appreciate about Sam. He pushes us really hard to move fast, but he also understands that with moving fast comes, we didn't quite get this right or that we launched this thing, it didn't work. We'll roll it back. Look at our naming. Our naming is horrible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
That was a lot of questions people had for you. Model names, yeah.

Kevin Weil (00:29:18):
It's absolutely atrocious and we know it, and we will get around to fixing it at some point, but it's not the most important thing and so we don't spend a lot of time on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
But it also shows you how it doesn't matter. Again, ChatGPT the most popular, fastest growing product in history, it's the number one AI, API and model. So clearly it doesn't matter that much.

Kevin Weil (00:29:39):
And we name things like o3 mini high.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):
Man, I love it. Okay. So you talked about roadmapping and bottoms up and I'm really curious, is there a cadence or a ritual of aligning with you or Sam or you review everything that's going out? Is there a meeting every week or every month where you guys see what's happening?

Kevin Weil (00:30:03):
On key projects. So we do product reviews and things like that, like you would expect. There isn't a ritual because there isn't... I would never want us to be blocked on launching something, waiting for a review with me or Sam, if we can't get there. If I'm traveling or Sam's busy or whatever, that's a bad reason for us not to ship. So obviously for the biggest, most high priority stuff, we have a pretty close beat on it, but we really try not to, frankly. We want to empower teams to move quickly, and I think it's more important to ship and iterate.

(00:30:42):
So we have this philosophy, we call iterative deployment, and the idea is we're all learning about these models together. So there's a real sense in which it's way better to ship something even when you don't know the full set of capabilities and iterate together in public. And we co-evolve together with the rest of society as we learn about these things and where they're different and where they're good and bad and weird. I really like that philosophy.

(00:31:12):
I think the other thing that ends up being a part of our product philosophy is the sense of model maximalism. The models are not perfect. They're going to make mistakes. You could spend a lot of time building all kinds of different scaffolding around them. And by the way, sometimes we do because sometimes there are kinds of errors that you just don't want to make, but we don't spend that much time building scaffolding around the parts that don't match that because our general mindset is in two months there's going to be a better model and it's going to blow away whatever the current set of limitations are.

(00:31:52):
So if you're building, and we say this to developers too, if you're building and the product that you're building is right on the edge of the capabilities of the models, keep going, because you're doing something right because you give it another couple months and the models are going to be great, and suddenly the product that you have that just barely worked is really going to sing. And that's how you make sure that you're really pushing the envelope and building new things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
I had the founder of Bolt on the podcast, StackBlitz is the company name, and he shared this story that they've been working on this product for seven years behind the scenes and it was failing. Nothing was happening. And then all of a sudden it was, sorry to mention a competitor, but Claude came out or a Sonnet 3.5 came out and all of a sudden everything worked and they've been building all this time and finally it worked. And I hear that a lot with YC, just like things that never were possible now are just becoming possible every few months with the updates to the models.

Kevin Weil (00:32:48):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
Let me actually ask this, I wasn't planning to ask this, but I'm curious if you have any quick thoughts just why is Sonnet so good at coding, and thoughts on your stuff getting as good and better at actual coding?

Kevin Weil (00:33:01):
Yeah. I mean, kudos to Anthropic. They've built very good coding models. No doubt. We think that we can do the same. Maybe by the time this podcast has shipped, we'll have more to say, but either way, all credit to them. I think intelligence is really multi-dimensional and so I think the model providers... It used to be that OpenAI had this massive model lead, 12 months or something ahead of everybody else. That's not true anymore. I like to think we still have a lead. I'd argue that we do, but it's certainly not a massive one. And that means that there are going to be different places where the Google models are really good or where Anthropic models are really good, or where we're really good and our competitors are like, "We got to get better at that." And it actually is easier to get better at a certain thing once someone's proved it possible than it is to forge a path through the jungle and doing something brand new.

(00:34:03):
So I just think as an example, it was like nobody could break 4 minutes in the mile, and then finally somebody did and the next year 12 more people did it. I think there's that all over the place and it just means that competition is really intense, and consumers are going to win and developers are going to win and businesses are going to win in a big way from that. It's part of why the industry moves so fast, but all respect to the other big model providers. Models are getting really good. We're going to move as fast as we can and I think we've got some good stuff coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:36):
Exciting. This makes me also think about, in many ways other models are better at certain things, but somehow ChatGPT is the... If you look at all the awareness numbers and usage numbers, it's like no matter where you guys are in the rankings, people seem to just think of AI ChatGPT almost as the same. What do you think you did right to win in the consumer mindset, at least at this point and awareness in the world?

Kevin Weil (00:35:02):
I think being first helps, which is one of the reasons why we're so focused on moving quickly. We like being the first to launch new capabilities. Things like deep research. Our models, they can do a lot of things. So they can take real-time video input, you have speech to speech, you can do speech to text and text to speech. They can do deep research. They can operate on a canvas, they can write code. So ChatGPT can be this one- stop-shop where all the things that you want to do are possible. And as we go forward in it, we have more agentic tools like Operator where it's browsing for you and doing things for you on the web, more and more you're going to be able to come to this one place to ChatGPT, give it instructions and have it accomplish real things for you in the world. There's something fundamentally valuable in that. So we think a lot about that. We try to move really fast so that we are always the most useful place for people to come to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:04):
What would you say is the most counterintuitive thing that you've learned after building AI products or working at OpenAI, something that's just like, "I did not expect that?"

Kevin Weil (00:36:14):
I don't know, maybe I should have expected this, but one of the things that's been funny for me is the extent to which you're trying to figure out how some product should work with AI, or even why some AI thing happens to be true, you can often reason about it the way you would reason about another human and it works. So maybe a couple examples. When we were first launching our reasoning model, we were the first to build a model that could reason, that could, instead of giving you just a quick system one answer right away to every question you asked, it was the third Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, here's an answer.

(00:36:59):
You could ask it hard questions and it would reason. The same way that if I asked you to do a crossword puzzle, you couldn't just snap fill in everything. You would be, "Well, okay. On this one across, I think it could be one of these two, but that means there's an A here. So that one has to be this, away, back track, step-by-step build up from where you are." Same way you answer any difficult logistical problem, any scientific problem. So this reasoning breakthrough was big, but it was also the first time that a model needed to sit and think. And that's a weird paradigm for a consumer product. You don't normally have something where you might need to hang out for 25 seconds after you ask a question.

(00:37:40):
So we were trying to figure out what's the UI for this? With deep research where the model's going to go and think for 25 minutes sometimes, it's actually not that hard because you're not going to sit and watch it for 25 minutes. You're going to go do something else. You're going to go to another tab or go get lunch or whatever, and then you'll come back and it's done when it's like 20, 25 seconds or 10 seconds, it's a long time to wait, but it's not long enough to go to do something else.

(00:38:09):
So you can think, if you asked me something that I needed to think for 20 seconds to answer, what would I do? I wouldn't just go mute and not say anything and shut down for 20 seconds and then come back. So we shouldn't do that. We shouldn't just have a slider sitting there. That's annoying. But I also wouldn't just start babbling every single thought that I had. So we probably shouldn't just expose the whole chain of thought as the model's thinking, but I might go like, "That's a good question. All right." I might approach it like that and then think. You're maybe giving little updates and that's actually what we ended up shipping.

(00:38:49):
You have similar things where you can find situations where you get better thinking sometimes out of a group of models that all try and attack the same problem, and then you have a model that's looking at all their outputs and integrating it and then giving you a single answer at the end. I mean, sounds a little bit like brainstorming. I certainly have better ideas when I get in a room and brainstorm with other people because they think differently than me. So anyways, there's just all these situations where you can actually reason about it like a group of humans or an individual human and it works, which I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised but I was.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):
That is so interesting because when I see these models operate, I never even thought about you guys designing that experience. To me, it just feels like this is what the LLM does. It just sits there and tells me what it's thinking. And I love this point you're making of let's make it feel like a human operating and well, how does a human operate? Well, they just talk aloud. They think, here's the thing I should explore. And I love that deep sequence to the extreme of that where they're just like, "Here's everything I'm doing and thinking." And people actually like that too, I guess. Was that surprising to you, "Maybe that could work too. People seem to like everything?"

Kevin Weil (00:40:02):
Yeah. We learned from that actually because when we first launched it, we gave you the subheadings of what the model was thinking about, but not much more. And then deep seek launched and it was a lot and we went, I don't know if everyone wants that. There's some novelty effect to seeing what the model's really thinking about. We felt that too when we were looking at it internally. It's interesting to see the model's chain of thought, but it's not... I think at the scale of 400 million people, you don't want to see the model babble a bunch of things.

(00:40:34):
So what we ended up doing was summarizing it in interesting ways. So instead of just getting the subheadings, you're getting one or two sentences about how it's thinking about it and you can learn from that. So we tried to find a middle ground that we thought was an experience would be meaningful for most people, but showing everybody three paragraphs is probably not the right answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:57):
This reminds me of something else you said at the summit that has really stuck with me, this idea that chat, people always make fun of chat is not the future interface for how we interact with AI, but you made this really interesting point that may argue the other side, which is, as humans we interface by talking and the IQ of a human can span from really low to really high and it all works talking to them and chat is the same thing and it can work on all kinds of intelligence levels. Maybe I just shared it, but I guess anything there about just why chat actually ends up being such an interesting interface for LLMs?

Kevin Weil (00:41:30):
Yeah. I don't know, maybe this is one of those things I believe that most people don't believe, but I actually think chat is an amazing interface because it's so versatile. People tend to go, "Chat. Yeah. We'll figure out something better." And I think it's incredibly universal because it is the way we talk. I can talk to you verbally like we're talking now. We can see each other and interact. We can talk on WhatsApp and be texting each other, but all of these things is this unstructured method of communication and that's how we operate.

(00:42:12):
If I had some more rigid interface that I was allowed to use when we spoke, I would be able to speak to you about far fewer things and it would actually get in the way of us having maximum communication bandwidth. So there's something magical. And by the way, in the past it never worked because there wasn't a model that was good at understanding all of the complexity and nuances of human speech, and that's the magic of LLMs. So to me, it's like an interface that's exactly fit to the power of these things. And that doesn't mean that it always has to be just like I don't necessarily always want to type, but you do want that very open-ended, flexible communication medium, it may be that we're speaking and the model's speaking back to me, but you still want the very lowest common denominator, no restrictions way of interacting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
That is so interesting. That's really changed the way I think about this stuff is that point that chat is just so good for this very specific problem of talking to superintelligence basically.

Kevin Weil (00:43:13):
By the way, I think it's not that it's only chat either. If you have high volume use cases where they're more prescribed and you don't actually need the full generality, there are many use cases where it's better to have something that's less flexible, more prescribed, faster to specific task, and those are great too, and you can build all sorts of those. But you still want chat as this baseline for anything that falls out of whatever vertical you happen to be building for. It's like a catch-all for every possible thing you'd ever want to express to a model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:51):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long-time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:43:58):
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:00):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs?

Christina Gilbert (00:44:15):
Yes. So we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead, use something like OneSchema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:44:49):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers, and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:45:23):
I want to come back to that you talked about researchers and their relationship with product teams. I imagine a lot of innovation comes from researchers just like having an inkling and then building something amazing and then releasing it, and some ideas come from PMs and engineers. How do those teams collaborate? Does every team have a PM? Is it a lot of research-led stuff? Give us a sense of just where ideas and products come from mostly.

Kevin Weil (00:45:49):
It's an area where we're evolving a lot. I'm really excited about it, frankly. I think if you go back a couple of years when ChatGPT was just getting started, obviously, I wasn't in OpenAI, but...

Kevin Weil (00:46:00):
Obviously I wasn't an Open AI, but... We were more of a pure research company at the time. Chat GPT, if you remember, was a low-key research preview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:14):
For many years.

Kevin Weil (00:46:15):
Yeah. It wasn't a thing that the team launched thinking it was going to be this massive product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:19):
Oh, Chat GPT. Yeah.

Kevin Weil (00:46:21):
And it was just a way that we were going to let people play with and iterate on the models. So we were primarily a research company, a world-class research company, and as ChatGPT has grown and as we've built our B-to-B products and our APIs and other things, now we're more of a product company than we were. I still think we can't... Open AI should never be a pure product company. We need to be both a world-class research company and a world-class product company, and the two need to really work together, and that's the thing that I think we've been getting much better at over the last six months. If you treat those things separately and the researchers go do amazing things and build models and then they get to some state and then the product and engineering teams go take them and do something with them, we're effectively just an API consumer of our own models.

(00:47:17):
The best products though are going to be, it's like I was talking about with deep research, it's a lot of iterative feedback. It's understanding the products you're trying to sell or the problems you're trying to solve, building evals for them, using those evals to go gather data and fine-tune models to get them to be better at these use cases that you're looking to solve. It's a huge amount of back and forth to do it well. And I think the best products are going to be ENG product design and research working together as a single team to build novel things. So that's actually how we're trying to operate with basically anything that we build. It's a new muscle for us because we're kind of new as a product company, but it's one that people are really excited about because we've seen every time we do it, we build something awesome, and so now every product starts like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:07):
How many product managers do you have at Open AI? I don't know if you share that number, but if you do.

Kevin Weil (00:48:11):
Not that many, actually. I don't know, 25. Maybe it's a little more than that. My personal belief is that you want to be pretty PM light as an organization just in general. I say this with love because I am a PM, but too many PMs causes problems. We'll fill the world with decks and ideas versus execution. So I think it's a good thing when you have a PM that is working with maybe slightly too many engineers because it means they're not going to get in and micromanage. You're going to leave a lot of influence and responsibility with the engineers to make decisions. It means you want to have really product-focused engineers, which we're fortunate to have. We have an amazingly product focused, high agency engineering team. But when you have something like that, you have a team that feels super empowered, you have a PM that's trying to really understand the problems and gently guide the team a little bit but has too much going on to get too far into the details, and you end up being able to move really fast. So that's kind of the philosophy we take.

(00:49:23):
We want Product ENG leads and product engineers all the way through. We want not too many PMs, but really awesome, high quality ones, and so far that seems to be working pretty well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:36):
I imagine being a PM at Open AI is a dream come true for a lot of people. At the same time, I imagine it's not a fit for a lot of people. There's researchers involved, very product minded engineers. What do you look for in the PMs that you hire there for folks that are like, "Maybe I shouldn't go work there. I shouldn't even think about that."

Kevin Weil (00:49:54):
I think, I've said this a few times, but high agency is something that we really look for, people that are not going to come in and wait for everyone else to allow them to do something, they're just going to see a problem and go do it. It's just a core part of how we work. I think people that are happy with ambiguity, because there is a massive amount of ambiguity here, it is not the kind of place, and we have trouble sometimes with more junior PMs because of this, because it's just not the place where someone is going to come in and say, "Okay, here's the landscape, here's your area, I want you to go do this thing." And that's what you want as an early career PM. I mean, no one here has time and the problems are too ill-formed and we're figuring them all out as we go. And so high agency, very comfortable with ambiguity, ready to come in and help execute and move really quickly. That's kind of our recipe.

(00:50:55):
And I think also happy leading through influence because... I mean it's usual as a PM, people don't report to you, your team doesn't report to you, et cetera, but you also have the complexity of a research function, which is even more sort of self-directed and it's really important to build a good rapport with the research team. I think the EQ side of things is also super important for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):
I know at most companies, a PM comes in and they're just like, "Why do we need you?" And as a PM you have to earn trust and help people see the value, and I feel like at Open AI it's probably a very extreme version of that where they're like, "Why do we need this person? We have researchers, engineers, what are you going to do here?"

Kevin Weil (00:51:40):
Yeah, I think people appreciate it done right, but you bring people along. I think one of the most important things a PM can do well is be decisive. So there's a real fine line. You don't want to be making... I mean it's kind of like, I don't love the PM as the CEO of the product illusion all the time, but just like Sam in his role would be making mistakes if he made every single decision in every meeting that he was in. And he would also be making mistakes if he made no decisions in any meetings that he was in, right? It's understanding when to defer to your team and to let people innovate. And when there is a decision to be made that people either don't feel comfortable with or don't feel empowered to make, or a decision that has too many different disparate pros and cons that are spread out across a big group and someone needs to be decisive and make a call, it's a really important trait of a CEO.

(00:52:41):
It's something Sam does well, and it's also a really important trait of a PM kind of at a more microscopic level. So because there's so much ambiguity, it's not obvious what the answer is in a lot of cases, and so having a PM that can come in and... And by the way, this doesn't need to be a PM, I'm perfectly happy if it's anybody else, but I kind of look to the PM to say, if there's ambiguity and no one's making a call, you better make sure that we get a call made and we move forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):
This touches on a few posts I've done of just, where is AI going to take over work that we do versus help us with various work? So let me come at this question from a different direction of just how AI impacts product teams and hiring, things like that. So first of all, there's all this talk of LM's doing our coding for us, and 90% of code is going to be written by AI in a year. Dario at Anthropic said that. At the same time, you guys are all hiring engineers like crazy, PM's like crazy. Every function is dead, but you're still hiring every single one. I guess just, first of all, let me just ask this, how do you and the team, say engineers, PMs, use AI in your work? Is there anything that's really interesting or things that you think people are sleeping on in how you use AI in your day-to-day work?

Kevin Weil (00:53:52):
We use it a lot. I mean, every one of us is in Chat GPT all the time summarizing docs, using it to help write docs with GPTs that write product specs and things like that, all the stuff that you would imagine. I mean talk about writing evals, you can actually use models to help you write evals and they're pretty good at it. That all said, I'm still sort of disappointed by us, and I really mean me, in, if I were to just teleport my five-year-old self leading product at some other company into my day job, I would recognize it still. And I think we should be in a world, certainly a year from now, probably even more now, where I almost wouldn't recognize it because the workflows are so different and I'm using AI so heavily, and I'd still recognize it today. So I think in some sense, I'm not doing a good enough job of that.

(00:54:46):
Just to give an example, why shouldn't we be vibe coding demos right, left and center? Instead of showing stuff in Figma, we should be showing prototypes that people are vibe coding over the course of 30 minutes to illustrate proofs of concept and to explore ideas. That's totally possible today, and we're not doing it enough. Actually, our chief people officer, Julia, was telling me the other day, she vibe coded an internal tool that she had at a previous job that she really wanted to have here at Open AI and she opened, I don't know, Windsurf or something, and vibe coded it. How cool is that? And if our chief people officer is doing it, we have no excuse to not be doing it more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:34):
That's an awesome story. And some people may not have heard this term vibe coding. Can you describe what that means?

Kevin Weil (00:55:40):
Yeah, I think this was Andrej's term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:45):
Karpathy. Yeah.

Kevin Weil (00:55:46):
Andrej Karpathy. Yeah. So you have these tools like Cursor and Windsurf and GitHub Copilot that are very good at suggesting what code you might want to write. So you can give them a prompt and they'll write code and then as you go to edit it, it's suggesting what you might want to do. And the way that everyone started using that stuff was, give it a prompt, have it do stuff, you go edit it, give it a prompt, and you're kind of really going back and forth with the model the whole time. As the models are getting better and as people are getting more used to it, you can kind of just let go of the wheel a little bit. And when the model's suggesting stuff, it's just like, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Keep going. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(00:56:29):
And of course the model makes mistakes or it does something that doesn't compile, but when it doesn't compile, you paste the error in and you say, go, go, go, go, go. And then you test it out and it does one thing that you don't want it to do, so you enter in an instruction and say, go, go, go, go, go, and you just let the model do its thing. And it's not that you would do that for production code that needed to be super tight today yet, but for so many things, you're trying to get to a proof of concept, you're getting to a demo and you can really take your hands off the wheel and the model will do an amazing job, and that's vibe coding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:05):
That's an awesome explanation. I think the pro version of that, which is, I think, the way Andre even described it as you talk, there's a step like whisper or super whisper or something like that where you're talking to the model, not even typing.

Kevin Weil (00:57:17):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:19):
Oh man. So let me just ask, I guess, when you look at product teams in the future, you talked about how you guys should be doing this more, instead of designs, having prototypes, what do you think might be the biggest changes in how product teams are structured or built? Where do you think things are going in the next few years?

Kevin Weil (00:57:36):
I think you're definitely going to live in a world where you have researchers built into every product team. And I don't even mean just at foundation model companies because I think the future... Actually, frankly one thing that I'm sort of surprised about about our industry in general is that there's not a greater use of fine-tuned models. A lot of people... These models are very good, so our API does a lot of things really well, but when you have particular use cases, you can always make the model perform better on a particular use case by fine-tuning it. It's probably just a matter of time. Folks aren't quite comfortable yet with doing that in every case. But to me, there's no question that that's the future. Models are going to be everywhere just like transistors are everywhere, AI is going to be just a part of the fabric of everything we do, but I think there are going to be a lot of fine-tuned models because why would you not want to more specifically customize a model against a particular use case?

(00:58:37):
And so I think you're going to want sort of quasi researcher machine learning engineer types as part of pretty much every team because fine-tuning a model is just going to be part of the core workflow for building most products. So that's one change that maybe you're starting to see at foundation model companies that will propagate out to more teams over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):
I'm curious if there's a concrete example that makes that real, and I'll share one that comes to mind as you talk, which is, when you look at Cursor and Windsurf, something I learned from those founders is that they use a Sonnet, but then they also have a bunch of custom models that help along the edges that make the specific experience that's not just generating code even better like auto-complete and looking ahead to where things are going. So is that one or any other examples of which you... What is a fine-tuned model? Do you think teams will be building with these researchers on their teams?

Kevin Weil (00:59:29):
Yeah. I mean, so when you're a model, you're basically giving the model a bunch of examples of the kinds of things you want it to be better at. So it's, "Here's a problem, here's a good answer. Here's a problem, here's a good answer," Or, "Here's a question, here's a good answer times a thousand or 10,000." And suddenly you're teaching the model to be much better than it was out of the gate at that particular thing. We use it everywhere internally. We use ensembles of models much more internally than people might think. So it's not, "I have 10 different problems. I'll just ask baseline GPT four oh about a bunch of these things." If we have 10 different problems, we might solve them using 20 different model calls, some of which are using specialized fine-tuned models, they're using models of different sizes because maybe you have different latency requirements or cost requirements for different questions.

(01:00:32):
They are probably using custom prompts for each one. Basically you want to teach the model to be really good at... You want to break the problem down into more specific tasks versus some broader set of high level tasks. And then you can use models very specifically to get very good at each individual thing. And then you have an ensemble that tackles the whole thing. I think a lot of good companies are doing that today. I still see a lot of companies giving the model single, generic, broad problems versus breaking the problem down, and I think there will be more breaking the problem down using specific models for specific things, including fine tuning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):
And so in your case, because this is really interesting, is that you're using different levels of Chat GPT, like a 1 0 3 and stuff that's earlier because it's cheaper.

Kevin Weil (01:01:24):
There'll be parts of our internal stack. I'll give you an example. Customer support, with 400 plus million weekly active users, we get a lot of inbound tickets. I don't know how many customer support folks we have, but it's not very many, 30, 40, I'm not sure, way smaller than you would have at any comparable company, and it's because we've automated a lot of our flows. We've got most questions using our internal resources, knowledge base, guidelines for how we answer questions, what kind of personality, et cetera. You can teach the model those things and then have it do a lot of its answers automatically, or where it doesn't have the full confidence to answer a particular question, it can still suggest an answer, request a human to look at it and then that human's answer actually is its own sort of fine tuning data for the model. You're telling it the right answer in a particular case.

(01:02:29):
We're using... At various places. Some of these places, you want a little bit more reasoning, is not super latency sensitive, so you want a little more reasoning, and we'll use one of our O series models. In other places, you want a quick check on something and so you're fine to use four oh mini, which is super fast and super cheap. In general, it's like specific models for specific purposes and then you ensemble them together to solve problems. By the way, again, not unlike how we as humans solve problems, a company is arguably an ensemble of models that have all been fine tuned based on what we studied in college and what we have learned over the course of our careers. We've all been fine tuned to have different sets of skills and you group them together in different configurations and the output of the ensemble is much better than the output of any one individual.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:20):
Kevin, you're blowing my mind. That sounds exactly correct. And also, different people, you pay them less, they cost less to talk to, some people take a long time to answer, some people hallucinating. This is...

Kevin Weil (01:03:38):
I'm telling you. This is a mental model but really does work in thinking...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):
Oh, right. Yeah. This is great. Some people are visual, they want to dry out their thinking, some people want to talk word cell. Wow, this is a really good metaphor. So again, coming back to your advice here because I love that we circled back to it, you're finding a really good way to think about how to design great AI experiences and LMs, I guess, specifically is think about how a person would do this.

Kevin Weil (01:04:01):
Well, it's maybe not always the answer is to think about how a person would do it, but sometimes to gain intuition for how you might solve a problem, you think about what an equivalent human would do in those situations and use that to at least gain a different perspective on the problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):
Wow, this is great.

Kevin Weil (01:04:22):
Because some of this really is talking to a model. There's a lot of prior art because we talk to other humans all the time and encounter them in all sorts of different situations, and so there's a lot to learn from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):
Okay, so speaking of humans, I want to chat about the future a little bit. So you have three kids, and a community member asked me this hilarious question that I think it's something a lot of people are thinking about. So this is Patrick [inaudible 01:04:47]. I worked with him at Airbnb. He says ask what he's encouraging his kids to learn to prepare for the future. I'm worried my 6-year-old by the year 2036 will face a lot of competition trying to get into the top roofing or plumbing programs and need a backup plan.

Kevin Weil (01:05:02):
That's funny. So our kids, we have a 10 year old and eight year old twins, so they're still pretty young. It's amazing how AI native they are. It's completely normal to them that there are self-driving cars. That they can talk to AI all day long. They have full conversations with Chat GPT and Alexa and everything else. I don't know, who knows what the future holds? I think things like coding skills are going to be relevant for a long time, who knows? But I think if you teach your kids to be curious, to be independent, to be self-confident, you teach them how to think, I don't know what the future holds, but I think that those are going to be skills that are going to be important in any configuration of the future. And so it's not like we have all the answers, but that's how Elizabeth and I think about our kids.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:02):
And do you find that AI... There's a lot of talk about AI tutoring. Is that something you guys are doing? I know they're using Chat GPT, I love all the photos you post where they're playing with prompts and stuff, but I guess is there anything there you're experimenting with or you think is going to become really important?

Kevin Weil (01:06:16):
This is something that... It's maybe the most important thing that AI could do. Maybe that's a grand statement. There are lots of important things that AI can do, including speeding up the pace of fundamental science research and discovery, which maybe is actually the most important thing AI can do. But one of the most important things would be personalized tutoring. And it kind of blows my mind that there is still... I know there are a bunch of good products out there. Khan Academy does great things. They're a wonderful partner of ours. Vinod Khosla has a non-profit that's doing some really interesting stuff in this space and is making an impact. But I'm kind of surprised that there isn't a 2 billion kid AI personalized tutoring thing because the models are good enough to do it now, and every study out there that's ever been done seems to show that when you have... Like, education is still important, but when you combine that with personalized tutoring, you get multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed.

(01:07:31):
And so it's uncontroversial, it's good for kids, it's free. Chat GPT is free, you don't need to pay, and the models are good enough. It still just kind of blows my mind that there isn't something amazing out there that our kids are using and your future kids are using, and people in all sorts of places around the world that aren't as lucky as our kids to be able to have this sort of built-in, solid education. Again, Chat GPT is free. People have Android devices everywhere. I really just think this could change the world and I'm surprised it doesn't exist and I want it to exist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:08):
This kind of touches on something I want to spend a little time on, which is a lot of people also worry a lot about AI, where it's going, they worry about jobs it's going to take, they worry about the super intelligence squashing humanity in the future. What's your perspective on that and just the optimistic case that I think people need to hear?

Kevin Weil (01:08:27):
I mean, I'm a big technology optimist. I think if you look over the last 200 years, maybe more, technology has driven a lot of the advancements that have made us the world and the society that we are today. It drives economic advancements, it drives geopolitical advancements, quality of life, longevity advancement. I mean, technology's at the root of just about everything, so I think there are very few examples where this is anything but a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't...

Kevin Weil (01:09:00):
... a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't temporary dislocations or where there aren't individuals that are impacted, and that matters too. So it can't just be that the average is good. You've got to also think about how you take care of each individual person as best you can.

(01:09:18):
It is something that we think a lot about and as we work with the administration, as we work with policy, we try and help wherever we can. We do a lot with education. One of the benefits here is that ChatGPT is also perhaps the best reskilling app you could possibly want. It knows a lot of things. It can teach you a lot of things if you're interested in learning new things.

(01:09:43):
These are very real issues. I'm super optimistic about the long run, and we're going to need to do everything we can as a society to ensure that we make this transition as graceful and as well-supported as we can.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):
To give people a sense of where things might be going. That's a big question in a lot of people's minds. So someone asked this question that I love, which is, "AI is already changing, creative work in a lot of different ways, writing and design and coding, what do you think is the next big leap? What should we be thinking is the next big leap in AI-assisted creativity specifically, and then just broadly, where do you think things are going to be going in the next few years?"

Kevin Weil (01:10:23):
Yeah. This is also an area where I'm a big optimist. If you look at Sora, for example. I mean we talked about ImageGen earlier and the absolute fount of creativity that people are putting across Twitter and Instagram and other places. I am the world's worst artist like the worst. Maybe the only thing I'm worse at than art is singing. Give me a pencil and a pad of paper and I can't draw better than our eight-year-old. But give me ImageGen and I can think some creative thoughts and put something into the model and suddenly have output that I couldn't have possibly done myself. That's pretty cool.

(01:11:09):
Even you look at folks that are really talented. I was talking to a director recently about Sora, someone who's directed films that we would all know, and he was saying, for a film that he's doing, take the example of some sort of sci-fi-ish, think of Star Wars, and you've got some scene where there's a plane zooming into some Death Star-like thing. And so you've got the plane looking at the whole planet, and then you want to cut to a scene where the plane's kind of at the ground level, and all of a sudden you see the city and everything else. How are we going to manage that cut scene? And that transition?

(01:11:51):
And he was saying, "In the world of two years ago, I would have paid a 3D effects company a hundred grand and they would've taken a month, and they would've produced two versions of this cut scene for me. And I would've evaluated them. We would've chosen one, because what are you going to do? Pay another 50 grand and wait another month. And we would've just gone with it. And it would be fine. Movies are great. I love them. And there've been..."

(01:12:25):
Obviously, we can do great things with the technology that we've had, but you now look at what you can do with Sora. And his point was, "Now, I can use Sora, our video model, and I can get 50 different variations of this cut scene just me brainstorming into a prompt and the model brainstorming a little bit with me. I've got 50 different versions. And then of course, I can iterate off of those and refine them and take different ideas. And now I'm still going to go to that 3D effects studio to produce the final one, but I'm going to go having brainstormed and had a much more creative approach with an outcome that's much better. And I did that assisted by AI."

(01:13:08):
My personal view on creativity in general is that it's no one's going to... You don't type into Sora like, "Make me a great movie." It requires creativity and ingenuity, and all these things, but it can help you explore more. It can help you get to a better final result. So, again, I tend to be an optimist in most things, but actually, I think there's a very good story here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:31):
I know Sam Altman, I think it was him who tweeted recently, the creative writing piece that you guys are working on where it's... He is very bad at writing creative stuff, and he shared an example where it's actually really good. I imagine that's another area of investment.

Kevin Weil (01:13:43):
Yeah, there's some exciting stuff happening internally with some new research techniques. We'll have more to say about that at some point. But yeah, Sam sometimes likes to show off some of the stuff that's coming, which is smart. By the way, it's very indicative of this iterative deployment philosophy. We don't have some breakthrough and keep it to ourselves forever, and then bestow it upon the world someday. We kind of just talk about the things we're working on and share when we can and launch early and often, and then iterate in public. I really like that philosophy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:22):
I love all these hints that a few things coming. I know you can't say too much. You talked about how there might be a coding leap coming in the near future maybe by the time this comes out. Is there anything else people should be thinking about, might be coming in the near future? Any things you can tease that are interesting? Exciting?

Kevin Weil (01:14:38):
Man, this hasn't been enough for you?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:41):
Only everything is getting better every day.

Kevin Weil (01:14:44):
Yeah. I'm like, man, I hope we get some of this stuff out before the episode launches so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):
This is your new timebox.

Kevin Weil (01:14:50):
... I don't piss people off. The amazing thing to me is we were talking earlier about how far models have come in just a couple of years. If you went back to GPT-3, you'd be disgusted by how bad it was, even though Lenny of two years ago was mind-blown by how good these were. And for a long time, we were iterating every six to nine months on a new GPT model. It was like GPT-3, GPT-3.5, 4, and now with this o-series of reasoning models, we're moving even faster. Every roughly three months, maybe four months, there's a new o-series model, and each of them is a step up in capability.

(01:15:41):
And so the capabilities of these models are increasing at a massive pace. They're also getting cheaper as they scale. You look at where we were even a couple of years ago. I think the original, I don't know, what was it, GPT-3.5 or something was like 100 x the cost of GPT-4o mini today in the API. A couple of years, you've gone down two orders of magnitude in cost for much more intelligence. And so I don't know where there's another series of trends like that in the world. Models are getting smarter, they're getting faster, they're getting cheaper, and they're getting safer too. They hallucinate less every iteration.

(01:16:27):
And so the Morse Law and transistors becoming ubiquitous. That was a law around doubling the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months. If you're talking about something where you're getting 10 x every year, that's a massively steeper exponential. And it tells us that the future is going to be very different than today. The thing I try and remind myself is, the AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life. And when you actually get that in your head, it's kind of wild.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:08):
I was going to actually say the same thing, and that's the thing that always sticks with me when I watch this thing. You're talking about Sora, and I imagine many people hearing that are like, "No, no. It's not actually ready. It's not good enough. It's not going to be as good as a movie I see in the theater." But the point is what you just made that this is the worst it's going to be. It will only get better.

Kevin Weil (01:17:25):
Yeah, model maximalism. Just keep building for the capabilities that are almost there, and the model's going to catch up and be amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):
Escape to where the puck is going to be.

Kevin Weil (01:17:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:38):
This reminds me, I was just using... I was duplifying everything the other day and I was just like, "What is taking so long."

Kevin Weil (01:17:38):
As one does.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:43):
Just like cut... What was that?

Kevin Weil (01:17:45):
I said, as one does.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):
As one does these days. I was just like, "It's taking a minute to generate this image of my family in this amazing way." Come on, what's taking so long. You just get so used to magic happening in front of you.

Kevin Weil (01:17:57):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):
Okay, final question. This is going to go in a completely different direction. A lot of people asked about this. So famously, you led this project at Facebook called Libra, which is now called Novi. A lot of people always wondered, "What happened there? That was a really cool idea." I know some people have a sense there's regulation challenges, things like that. I don't know if you've talked about this much. So I guess, could you just give people a brief summary of just what is Libra? This project you working on, and just what happened, and how you feel about it?

Kevin Weil (01:18:26):
Yeah. I mean, David Marcus led it, and I happily work for him and with him. I think he's a visionary and also a mentor and a friend. Honestly, Libra is probably the biggest disappointment of my career. When I think about the problems we were solving, which are very real problems. If you look at, for example, the remittance space, people sending money to family members in other countries, it is maybe... I mean it's incredibly regressive, right? People that don't have the money to spend are having to pay 20% to send money home to their family. So outrageous fees, it takes multiple days, you have to go then pick up cash from... It's all bad.

(01:19:11):
And here we are with 3 billion people using WhatsApp all over the world, talking to each other every day, especially friends and family, and exactly the kind of people who'd send money to each other. Why can't you send money as immediately, as cheaply, as simply as you send a text message? It is one of those things when you sit back and think about it, that should just exist. And that was what we set out to try and do.

(01:19:41):
Now, I don't think we played all of our cards perfectly. If I could go back and do things, there are a bunch of things I would do differently.

(01:19:50):
We tried to get it all at once. We tried to launch a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger, and I think the whole world kind of went like, "Oh my God, that's a lot of change at once." And it happened also to be at the time that Facebook was at the absolute nadir of its reputation. And so that didn't help. It was also not the Messenger that people wanted for this kind of change. We knew all that going in, but we went for it.

(01:20:21):
I think there are a bunch of ways that we could do that that would've introduced the change a little bit more gently, maybe still gotten to that same outcome, but fewer new things at once and introduced the new things one at a time. Who knows? Those were decisions we made together. So we all own them. Certainly, I own them. But it fundamentally disappoints me that this doesn't exist in the world today because the world would be a better place if we'd been able to ship that product. I would be able to send you 50 cents in WhatsApp for free. It would settle instantly. Everybody would have a balance in their WhatsApp account. We'd be transact... I mean, it should exist.

(01:21:03):
I don't know. To be honest, the current administration is super friendly to crypto. Facebook's reputation, Meta's reputation is in a very different place. Maybe they should go build it now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):
I was looking at the history of it, and apparently, they sold the tech to some private equity company for 200 million bucks.

Kevin Weil (01:21:19):
Yeah, yeah, and-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:21):
They had to buy it back.

Kevin Weil (01:21:23):
There are a couple of current blockchains that are built on the tech because the tech was open-sourced from the beginning. Aptos and Mistin are two companies that are built off of this tech. So at least all of the work that we did, did not die and lives on in these two companies, and they're both doing really well. But still, we should be able to send each other money in WhatsApp, and we can't today.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:49):
Hear, hear. Well, thanks for sharing that story, Kevin. Is there anything else you want to share or maybe a last negative advice or insight before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kevin Weil (01:21:58):
Ooh, the lightning round. Let's just go do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):
Let's do it. With that, Kevin, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kevin Weil (01:22:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):
Let's do it. Okay. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Kevin Weil (01:22:12):
Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick, a really good book about AI and how to use it in your daily life as a student, as a teacher. He's super thoughtful. Also, by the way, a very good follow on Twitter. The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zion. Very good if you're interested in geopolitics and the forces that sort of shape the dynamics happening. And then I really enjoyed Cable Cowboy, I don't know who the author is, but the biography of John Malone. Just fascinating. If you like business, especially if you want to get into... I mean the man was an incredible dealmaker and shaped a lot of the modern cable industry. So that was a good biography.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:53):
These are all first-time mentions, which is always a great,

Kevin Weil (01:22:56):
Oh, good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):
Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Kevin Weil (01:23:02):
I wish I had time to watch a TV show, so I'm-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:06):
Just Sora videos.

Kevin Weil (01:23:07):
Yeah, right. I don't know. When I was a kid, I read the Wheel of Time series and now Amazon has it as they're in the third season of it, so I want to watch that. I haven't yet. Top Gun 2 was an awesome movie. I think that's no longer new.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):
That shows when the last time you watched a movie was.

Kevin Weil (01:23:31):
But I like the idea. I want more Americana. I want more being proud of being strong. And I thought Top Gun 2 did a really good job of that. Pride and patriotism, I think the US could use more of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:48):
Is there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love, other than your super intelligence internal tool that you all have access to? I'm just joking.

Kevin Weil (01:23:56):
That's right. Internal AGR.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:57):
Yeah, that's right.

Kevin Weil (01:24:01):
Well, I think vibe coding with products like Windsurf is just super fun. I'm having a great time doing that. I still just love that our chief people officer vibe coded some tools. Maybe the other one is Waymo. Every chance I get, I'll take a Waymo. It's just a better way of riding, and it still feels like the future. So they've done an amazing job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:24):
That's awesome. By the way, I had the founder of Windsurf on the podcast. It might come out before this or after this. And also Cursor's CEO is coming on the podcast either before or after this.

Kevin Weil (01:24:32):
Oh, cool. I have a ton of respect for what those guys are doing. Those are awesome products.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
Just changing the way everyone builds product. No big deal.

Kevin Weil (01:24:38):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:40):
A couple more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, find really useful in work or in life?

Kevin Weil (01:24:47):
Yeah. So actually, this is interestingly enough, it is more of a philosophy, but then I thought Zuck encapsulated it one time on a Facebook earnings call. So I actually had this made into a poster. It sits in my room. But somebody was asking Mark. This is literally on an earnings call, so it's like an analyst on an earnings call asking him. It was some quarter when Facebook had grown a lot. This was back in the 20 teens sometime, I think. But he's like, "So what did you do? What was it that you launched? What was the one thing that drove all this growth for you?" And he said something to the effect of, "Sometimes it's not any one thing, it's just good work consistently over a long period of time." And that's always stuck with me.

(01:25:33):
And I think it is. I mean I run ultra marathons. It's like it's just about grinding. I think people too often look for the silver bullet when a lot of life and a lot of excellence is actually showing up day in and day out, doing good work, getting a little bit better every single day, and you may not notice it over a week or even a month. And a lot of people then kind of get dismayed and stop. But actually, you keep doing it. The gains keep compounding. And over the course of a year, two years, five years, it adds up like crazy. So good work consistently over a long period of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:13):
I love that. I got to make a poster of this now. That is-

Kevin Weil (01:26:15):
We'll get you one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:15):
I so resonate with that. Okay, I'll take it. That is so good. Okay, final question. I'm going to ask if you have any prompting tricks, and I'm going to set it up first. But think about if you have a trick that you could recommend to people for prompting LLMs better. I had a guest, Alex Komorowski, come on the podcast. He's from Stripe and writes his weekly reflections on what's happening in the world. A lot of them are AI-related.

(01:26:36):
And he once described an LLM as a zip file of all human knowledge. All the answers are in there, and you just need to figure out the right question to ask to get the answer to every problem basically. And so it just reminded me how important prompt engineering is and knowing how to prompt well. You're constantly prompting ChatGPT. What's one tip, one trick that you found to be helpful in helping you get what you want?

Kevin Weil (01:27:00):
Well, I'll say, first of all, I want to kill the idea that you have to be a good prompt engineer. I think if we do our jobs, that stops being true. It's just one of those sharp edges of models that experts can learn. But then, just over time, you shouldn't need to know all that. The same way you used to have to get deep into, "What's your storage engine in MySQL? Are you using InnoDB 4.1?" There's still use cases for that if you're at the deep edge of MySQL performance. But most people don't need to care. And you shouldn't need to care about minute details of prompting if AI is really going to become broadly adopted.

(01:27:39):
But today, we're not totally there. I think by the way, we are making progress there. I think there is less prompt engineering than there had to be before. But in line with some of the fine-tuning stuff I was talking about and the importance of giving examples, you can do effectively poor man's fine-tuning by including examples in your prompt of the kinds of things that you might want and a good answer. So like, "Here's an example and here's a good answer. Here's an example, and here's a good answer. Now, go solve this problem for me." And the model really will listen and learn from that.

(01:28:15):
Not as well as if you do a full fine-tune, but much more than if you don't provide any examples. And I think people don't do that often enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:24):
That's awesome. One tip that I heard, I'm curious if this works is you tell it, "This is very, very important to my career." Make it really understand like, "Someone will die if you don't answer me correctly." Does that work?

Kevin Weil (01:28:36):
It's really weird. There's probably a good explanation for this. But you can also say things. So, yes, I think there is some validity to that. You can also say things like, "I want you to be Einstein. Now, answer this physics problem for me," or, "You are the world's greatest marketer, the world's greatest brand marketer. Now here's a naming question." And there is something where it sort of shifts the model into a certain mindset that can actually be really positive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:10):
I use that tip all the time actually. I always... When I'm coming up with questions for interviews and I use it occasionally to come up with things I haven't thought of, I actually type, "You're the world's best podcast interviewer."

Kevin Weil (01:29:21):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:21):
I have Kevin Weil coming on the pod... Yeah, it actually works.

Kevin Weil (01:29:25):
By the way, back to our other point that we made a few times. You do do that sometimes with people. You sort of put them... You frame things, you get them into a certain mindset, and the answer is completely different. So I think there are human analogs of this one more time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:42):
Kevin, this was incredible. I was just thinking about a way to end this. The way I feel like... I feel like not only are you at the cutting edge of the future. You and the team are kind of actually the edge that is creating the future. And so it's a real honor to have you on here and to talk to you and to hear where you think things are going and what we need to be thinking about, so thank you for being here, Kevin.

Kevin Weil (01:30:07):
Oh, thank you so much for having me. I get to work with the world's best team, and all credit to them, but really appreciate you having me on. It's been super fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:17):
I forgot to ask you the two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Kevin Weil (01:30:24):
I am @kevinweil, K-E-V-I-N-W-E-I-L on pretty much every platform. I'm still a Twitter DAU after all these years. I guess an X DAU, LinkedIn, wherever. And I think the thing I would love from people, give me feedback. People are using ChatGPT. Tell me where it's working really well for you and where you want us to double down. Tell me where it's failing. I'm very active and engaged on Twitter. I love hearing from people, what's working and what's not, so don't be shy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:56):
And I learned following you helps you figure out all the stuff that you're launching. You share all the things that are going out every day, or week, month, so that's also a benefit. And by the way, 400 million weekly active users all emailing you feedback. Here we go.

Kevin Weil (01:31:08):
Yes, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:09):
It's going to work out great. Okay. Well, thank you, Kevin. Thanks for being here.

Kevin Weil (01:31:12):
All right, man, thanks so much. See you soon.

# Unorthodox PM tips: Automating user insights, unselling candidates, decision logs, more | Kevin Yien

## Transcript

Kevin Yien (00:00:00):
The PM job can become a little too internal, influencing my stakeholders and getting alignment and all these things. But if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:10):
You think every PM should keep a decision log?

Kevin Yien (00:00:13):
We all talk about product sense. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data. PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
We have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email.

Kevin Yien (00:00:31):
When you get to offer stage, I send an email and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. If you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join you, find yourself a A+ hire.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
I'm curious if you found any interesting uses of AI in your work.

Kevin Yien (00:00:49):
We are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today, my guest is Kevin Yien. Kevin leads product for merchant experiences at Stripe. Before that, he built the restaurant business and the ecosystem teams at Square, and most recently was head of product and design at Mutiny. He also makes ice cream and, as you'll hear in there conversation, was a pretty competitive eater for some part of his life.

(00:01:17):
In our conversation, Kevin shares a ton of unique and insightful perspectives on how to be a successful product manager, including how to get into product management, how to improve your relationship with your engineers and designers, bunch of advice on hiring, why you should keep a decision log, how to automate your customer research, plus a ton of really powerful stories around failure and AI and career.

(00:01:40):

(00:02:00):
Kevin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kevin Yien (00:02:04):
Thanks, Lenny. I am humbled to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:05):
I've been a big fan of yours from afar. I've been following you on Twitter for a long time. You have a very distinct profile photo that I feel like you maybe haven't changed for a long time. How long have you had this profile?

Kevin Yien (00:02:16):
Oh gosh, probably 2011 or 2012. The story behind that is I was inspired actually by Chris Dixon's avatar at the time and I wanted something really similar to it, but I couldn't figure out how to. Luckily, I was dating a designer at the time, and so she made me that sort of custom pick that has been my profile since then, and she's now my wife.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
Oh my god. Funny enough, I had a startup idea once where it's like a profile picture as a service business where there's these three tiers where it's like one has automated, one has someone illustrates, and one is a professional photo. It feels like everyone profile photos are so important.

Kevin Yien (00:02:54):
True.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:55):
But I never follow through. Probably not a good business anyway.

Kevin Yien (00:02:59):
Yeah, but a good idea, a good tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:00):
Good idea. Thank you. Thank you for making me feel better.

(00:03:03):
I've been looking forward to this conversation for a long time. As I said, I've been a big fan of yours for a long time. Something that I've noticed about you is you have a lot of really unique perspectives on a lot of different things, and in particular, product management, how to be successful as a PM, how to get into product management, things like that. So I thought it'd be fun to start there talking through some of these things that I've heard you talk about and then get into some very tactical stuff that you found to be useful in your product management career.

(00:03:29):
The first thing that I've heard you talk about is that you discourage people from going straight into product management. If they want to become product managers, you encourage them to start somewhere else first. Why is that? Where do you think people should start? Talk about this insight that you've had.

Kevin Yien (00:03:45):
Yeah, so follow me on the detour to science world temporarily. If we all remember high school science classes, there was this concept of potential and kinetic energy. There's so many different definitions for product management, but the one that I have come to myself that I really like is, when you are building a product, you have this team, engineers, designers, so much potential. The purpose of product management, not the person, but the practice, is to convert that potential into as much realized value for someone as possible, right? Minimum loss. When you're just getting started with a new product, the people that should be doing that are the people who are building it. That's an engineer, that's a designer, that's a sales person or a support person. They're the front line of the smallest loop possible to get something going, and it's through those practices that I think you're able to get the most exposure to what it takes to build a good product.

(00:04:50):
And then from there, that's your foundation. That's the unique perspective that you bring and allows you then to actually take on a "role" of product manager in a good, unique, insightful way. That's sort of like the foundation. There's a lot more to unpack behind that comparison, but that's where it comes from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
I love that. I'd love to unpack it further.

(00:05:10):
This episode is brought to you by BuildBetter.AI. Back in 2020 when AI was just a toy, BuildBetter bet that it could cut down on a product teams' operational BS. Fast-forward to today, 23,000 product teams use purpose-built AI in BuildBetter every day.

(00:06:22):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina (00:06:30):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:32):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina (00:06:47):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds. And the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina (00:07:21):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many four stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We have laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:40):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:07:54):
Every PM has their definition of what is product management, and I have one that I'm trying to find exactly what I wrote, but essentially, it's to marshal the resources of your team to solve customer problems and drive business impact most efficiently, something like that. And I feel like it's very aligned with your perspective, but I really love this view of it's unlocking the potential energy of the team. Not just marshaling the resources of a team, but it's there, and your job is to maximize their effort. And this is why when people say, "I hate product managers. I don't want any product managers at my team. We don't need product managers here," I feel like that's often because you've had a bad PM. Good PMs make you better and make your life better, allow you to do the work you want to do and they take all the stuff you don't want to do, make sure the stuff you're doing is worthwhile.

(00:08:38):
Is there anything more you want to add along those lines?

Kevin Yien (00:08:41):
To elaborate on that, I think the broader point is that truly not every team needs a product manager, but the activities, the outcome that one would drive needs to get done no matter what. And in some cases, this is why the prototypical companies that everyone references when they say, "They never had product managers, look at how successful they are," they're all building for themselves. Stripe, Twilio, Figma, designers for designers, engineers for engineers. When you are the customer, why the heck do you need someone else to help do the things that let you make decisions on what to build? But if you are not the customer, if you're working in a particularly complex space, if there's something that you, as the person that could build the product, feel you don't have, that's when you can essentially delegate that responsibility to someone else to say, "Hey, let me do the things I'm really good at and you do something that I need to get my job done."

(00:09:39):
So it's that sort of relationship that I think is often missing in the discourse. I think it would alleviate a lot of the, "We don't want PMs. PM is useless" or, "PM's one of the best thing since [inaudible 00:09:52]," which they're not. It's just a manifestation of that problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):
Yeah. Just to build on that, we're going on a tangent, but I think that's really interesting. I think there's another element of that, SNAP actually is another example where they waited, I think, until they had 200 people before they hired their first PM. To me, that's an example of other people were doing the PM job. As you said, there's PM activity, someone's doing them, lining people, prioritizing, making sure things are clear, making sure people aren't surprised, all these things PMs do. Someone's doing that, and my feeling is like, "Okay, your designers may love doing that, great. Let them do it." If your engineers that have a lot of product sense may want to do that, great.

(00:10:28):
But there's some point they either is like, "Forget it. I just want to code. I want to build that. I want to be sitting around in meetings all day," or they just aren't as good as things are scaling. And so it's kind of like, if your engineers, designers want to do it and are good at it, great. You don't need PMs for a long time. Oftentimes they're not good at it or they don't want to be sitting in doing all these PM things.

Kevin Yien (00:10:46):
Yep, precisely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):
Okay, so going back to the question of... So your advice is don't go straight into product management if you want to become a great PM. Where do you think people should start if they can? What are some options you recommend?

Kevin Yien (00:10:58):
The best way to think about this, in my opinion, is who were the people that you would be taking the PM responsibilities from and then do those jobs? And so for me, the sort of foundational three are going to be engineer, designer or salesperson. I think sales also gets not a bad rep, but a misrepresented reputation in tech where all they care about is quota, it's just about numbers, et cetera. In reality, the best salespeople are the best listeners, the best people at understanding the problem that the customer is having and then translating that into what you can do for them. And so if you get really good at having those calls, getting told no a lot, and being able to translate that, I mean, why would you not want to start there and then eventually move into something like product? So that's the foundational three for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):
So your advice is essentially if you want to be a PM, start as a designer or an engineer or a salesperson. I was an engineer, so this is exactly the path I went on. And I think there's an element of you start there and then you realize you're never going to be as amazing as the other people at that role and you're like, "Okay, maybe I should explore this other thing," because I was like, "I'm never going to be an amazing engineer. I'm good enough."

Kevin Yien (00:12:18):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:18):
I'm like, "I'm pretty good at this other stuff. Let's explore that."

Kevin Yien (00:12:21):
The one thing that I might tack on there, because this could lead to a negative perception, is, "Well, I'm never going to be a world-class engineer, world-class designer or et cetera, and so let me settle for being a PM." That could be the conclusion you arrive at, but I think a better way of framing it is, "I'm okay at those things. I'm potentially world-class at this other thing. Let me see what it feels like to double down on this area."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:44):
Absolutely.

Kevin Yien (00:12:45):
And I think that's just a good framing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:47):
Okay, so let's talk about another insight and piece of advice that you have, is that you think that great PMs need to be great writers. I think a lot of people don't necessarily think this. I think people may probably think, "If I'm an okay writer, I can probably be really successful PM." Talk about why you think it's so important to be a really great writer to be a really great PM.

Kevin Yien (00:13:07):
It's actually shocking for me to hear that this isn't commonplace sort of acceptance, but the place that this comes from for me is, writing is clarity at scale, and a key component to a PM's job is creating clarity both internally and externally, but it is both sides of that that I think often get lost. A lot of times the PM job can become a little too internal, and it's about influencing my stakeholders and getting alignment and all these things. Don't get me wrong, all that's very important. You should write your PRDs, they should be super crisp, they should articulate things really well, but I'm not saying that every PM needs to be a marketer or a world-class copywriter, but you should be able to write really compelling messaging in the voice of the person that you're trying to serve. And I'm working backwards from the beliefs that, if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product. And so that's where I think writing is the foundational component there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
There's a few quotes I say often on this podcast just because they always come to mind. One is by Joan Didion who said that, "I don't know what I think until I've written it down." And that's what I find with writing where I need to actually write it down for me to really understand what the heck I'm thinking to really crystallize it.

Kevin Yien (00:14:26):
Yeah, and I think writing is, it's both a mechanism for translating what you're trying to think into that thought into what you're actually trying to do, but then it needs additional revs to be properly consumed by everyone else. And that's I think the really hard part that a lot of folks don't do the extra mile effort to take on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
And this to your earlier point of a job of PM is to unlock this potential energy of your team, of the various resources you have and obviously having everyone aligned behind a very, like, "This is what we are doing and everyone understanding it" and it being very clear is really powerful there.

(00:15:06):
Okay. So this begs the question, how does one become a great writer? What helped you become a better writer? How do you feel about your ability to write at this point?

Kevin Yien (00:15:13):
Oh man.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Any advise on becoming better?

Kevin Yien (00:15:16):
I'll start with a slightly cheeky comment, which is, I think some of this is changing with the advent of large language models and the ability to actually just mimic someone else's tone. But I take inspiration from the camp of Anthony Bourdain, and he has, I'm going to butcher the exact quote but it's something like, "If you want to know how to make good food, you have to eat a lot of food, and you have to be willing to have a bad meal every now and again." And so for me, good writing comes from consuming as much good writing as possible. Sometimes you'll read something and say, "That was actually absolute fresh." But that's okay, you have to be willing to take on some of that stuff. But the more you index towards developing your own taste for what you think is good by consuming others, then you can shift into producing your own and then comparing them and riffing it off other people. So I think that's sort of the cycle that I've gone through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:13):
I have a friend who's a very good writer and a poet and helped me develop my writing early on, Vanessa, and she said exactly the same thing. Just to become a better writer, read beautiful writing, and it just kind of infuses you or your brain. In your experience, is there anything you read, anything you found really effective? Anything that you think influenced the way you write or think that people can check out?

Kevin Yien (00:16:36):
I explicitly do not mean read a bunch of other PM artifacts. You're not going to become a better writer by reading PRDs or whatever it is or support articles. It needs to be writing that compels. That's the theme I would go back to because that's what you're trying to do at the end of the day.

(00:16:56):
And when I say compels, I mean it pushes you to action. Because if you read something and you're like, "Oh, that's interesting," that's not enough. You need to be able to give someone something that then allows them to do something differently. And so the things for me that have been best... Obviously there's all the Paul Graham essays, I think his writing is very succinct, very clear, that's not novel. I learned a lot by finding specific voices back in the day on Twitter, and it wasn't always what they were posting on Twitter, but if they wrote an essay or a post, that would be their crispus thinking. And so you can use these broadcast channels to find where their golden nuggets are, but then spend time with those instead and don't worry about all the additional noise that comes with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
Paul Graham actually, you mentioned him, he has a great piece on how to become a good, that we'll link to, where basically his advice is, write the way you talk. Just keep it really simple and really regular. And so we'll link to that. Is there anything else along these lines of writing that you'd recommend for folks that are like, "Okay, I need to become a great writer. How do I do this?"?

Kevin Yien (00:18:02):
Actually along the lines of write how you talk, there's this concept of cadence that I think is really important when it comes to internal writing. There's probably some very good article about this, but it's the idea that if you only write in a monotonous cadence, either all really short sentences or all really long sentences, then your brain just tunes out eventually. And so you have to interrupt the pattern intentionally, and so you go short-long, long-short, whatever it is, but there's a few various specific things that you can do that allow someone to just roll through a post or something when you write that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:43):
Along those lines, there's a book that I just found to make sure I had the right title called Several Short Sentences About Writing that is really helpful along these lines. And the whole book is very short sentences and it teaches you to write very short sentences because once you're good at that, you can get better writing longer sentences. And so we'll link to that too. It's like a really good book that I have two copies around my house that I kind of poke at sometimes.

Kevin Yien (00:19:08):
Nice. I'll have [inaudible 00:19:09] too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):
Okay. Another area that you have a really clever insight into is how the PM role fits with engineering design. We've talked about this a little bit, but you have a really clever way of just thinking about how these roles interact and who's responsible for what. Talk about that.

Kevin Yien (00:19:24):
So this description came from writing PRDs at Square. I think there was a lot of confusion from my team specifically when I joined them. For what it's worth, it was new product line, three engineers, three designers, there was nothing but a slide deck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
Three engineers and three designers?

Kevin Yien (00:19:43):
The best ratio ever. This is a whole other thing. Most people, I would say, under invest in design, point-blank. When you get to a certain scale, maybe things change, but truly I don't think most teams have experienced what it feels like to have a really high design ratio and what that actually does to the quality of the work and the quality of the thinking. So shout out to designers. We need more, is the short version. And I would rather hire an incremental designer than PM almost any day of the week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:18):
Wow. I've never experienced this ratio. Incredible.

Kevin Yien (00:20:21):
Yes, I was very lucky. Shout out to Bruce Bell, who was my manager at the time, who was an ex designer, at the time, GM, and declared that starting ratio.

(00:20:31):
So anyways, with that setup, they all had sort of an opinion. They had seen PRDs in the past, they weren't quite sure what the purpose of it actually was because they had designs already. They had something to start from. And when I came in and talked to everyone and figured out where we needed to be in a year's time, I was like, "Okay, here's how I think it. Let me know if you agree." And this is a whole other concept, which is, the best way to get feedback from people is not by asking what they think, but to put something concrete in front of them and then have them react to it, right? So chewing fork.

(00:21:03):
And so my description is, PM should be doing everything in their power to draw the perimeter of the space, of the problem space. And it's within that, eng, design, everyone else that you're working with, they can go as crazy as they want, push up against the bounds and it's fill the box to its maximum capacity, but you've now applied the constraints that allow you to actually have productive conversations.

(00:21:26):
On the other end of the spectrum though, I think there's a lot of folks who think, "Oh, PMs are just strategy high in the clouds. All they do is kick things off." You need to be obsessed about the final deliverable and whether or not value is actually getting to the customer. I have a really trite example of this if you want to go down it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:46):
Please.

Kevin Yien (00:21:46):
But the key point I want to make is, I think it is tempting when we think about engineering product and design to draw these really clear swim lanes and say, "You do X. I do Y. Don't tread on my area." But you need these murky overlaps in order to build something really good.

(00:22:07):
And so even if the engineers are going to build a better product than you and the designers are going to design something better than you, you need to come with a strong opinion and you need to do the legwork to get their trust so they actually care about your opinion in the first place.

(00:22:21):
So time for a mini story. So Square, we're building a point of sale for restaurants. If you've ever seen one of these in a restaurant, there's this sort of grid of tiles that they tap to enter your order when you're sitting down for dinner. We were developing one, and there's this concept of a menu group. So it's a little box, you tap on it and then it pops the screen in so you go to the next level of the hierarchy. So example would be you have a wine button, you tap it, and you see your reds, whites, et cetera.

(00:22:53):
If you think about the people that we were trying to serve, there's the restaurants that were coming from a really old legacy system. And if you've seen a bartender tap on one of these, I mean it is muscle memory to the max. They're not even looking at the thing and just punching in the order blindfolded, and it's rapid fast.

(00:23:12):
On the other hand, you have people who are entering the workforce the first time, they've never used a point of sale. And so we have to serve both of these equally. Well, how do you deal with that level of speed but also the ease of use that anyone can learn it for the first time? And so there was this interaction that we really cared about, which was, when you tap on a menu group, what's the animation to pop you into that next level? This seems like such a small thing, but it made the difference in how easy it was to adopt for a lot of the restaurants.

(00:23:41):
And so a designer and myself spent literally an entire week just fine-tuning how many milliseconds it would take to pop in and out so that it felt right. And we actually brought in servers and bartenders to play with the prototypes we had on iPads and be like, "Here's an order. Pop it in." And we would see where they would sort of flinch or hesitate because the animation was too slow and they thought, "I can't tap it yet," or something related to that.

(00:24:07):
And so it's easy, I think, for a PM to say, "That's not my responsibility. I define the requirements. Have a menu group that goes to the next level, design or engineer, figure it out." No way. That's fully on you, and you better be involved in those details.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:24):
I love this. There's two directions I want to go. So there's the drawing the perimeter, and then there's this paying attention to the final deliverable and keeping the borrow really high, which I love and I totally agree with both.

(00:24:34):
In terms of this animation, people hearing this, that our PMs are going to be like, "How do you have time to spend a week on animation for one little product? I have so much to do. I get to hit some goals, drive some numbers. I have people waiting for me." Maybe because Square is like this, once you deploy, it's harder to change and it's like a big deal to ship. But I'm curious if you have any advice or things you've learned about how to create space for that sort of thing to create time to spend a week on this animation? Or was it just obvious to everyone, "We need to spend as much time as we can"? Top down, everyone knew.

Kevin Yien (00:25:07):
I definitely don't think it was obvious to everyone, and I can definitely say that because we were given a pretty strict deadline that we needed to launch by and I pushed it out three times. That's not because of this one animation, but it's because of a series of decisions where we said, "This is what we believe we need to ship, and this matters much more than hitting some artificial external GA date."

(00:25:35):
There's this other aspect that I think PMs like to feel good about how busy they are and they're like, "I'm involved in so many processes and I have to talk to this person and talk to that person." All that might be true, but I think there needs to be a calibration or at least a spring-cleaning of, "What's everything I'm doing?" and how much do these things actually matter to getting value to a customer. Because as a company gets bigger, as teams get more complex, it's very easy and natural to spend more time on things that are internally-focused and not externally-focused. I think we just all have to have sensitive antenna to that so that we don't fall prey to, "Well, the way that my job is described is to do these things," but really it's the outcome again of put something in a customer's hands that's also a problem, and it's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):
Reminds me of your now colleague Jeff Weinstein's advice he got from one of the Coulsons where they came to him and they're like, "You're world-class at doing the second and third most important things and you're not focusing on the most important thing because it's so hard, and that's something you need to work on."

Kevin Yien (00:26:47):
Totally. I will say so one on that, the CEO at Mutiny, Charlie, she always repeated to me nonstop, "Keep the main thing the main thing" and would just say it ad nauseum, and I'm really glad that she did. The one excuse I don't want to give folks is, as you progress in your career, you have to walk and chew gum at the same time. You can't say, "Oh, I'm only focused on this thing over here, so other folks handle that." You do have to figure out how to do a little bit more at the same time, but prioritization does play a factor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):
There's a framework [inaudible 00:27:27] suggested that I really like, the LNO framework. I forget exactly what the LNO stands for, but leverage something something. And we'll link to it in the show notes that gives you some advice on how to prioritize your time based on the stuff.

Kevin Yien (00:27:38):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:38):
Okay. So I guess in the case of pushing back to create space, this was just you as a product leader recognizing, "This is really important to get right. I will convince people we need to make more time for that."

Kevin Yien (00:27:50):
I don't want to make it seem like it was me against everyone because that was definitely not the case. I think the starting engineers and designers on that team really cared about the quality of what they built too. That's a pretty structural DNA for a team as well. If you don't start with that, and as a comparison, you have a team that really prides themselves on shipping fast and meeting deadlines really prescriptively, you might end up in a different world or your role as a PM might be a little bit more challenging if you want to push on this stuff. So I do think you have to take into account what is the DNA of the team. And then can you exploit that? Which I was able to do. Or do you actually have some change management to put into effect if you believe that it's worthwhile?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
Let's go back to the perimeter, drawing the perimeter concept to make that a little more real for people. So your advice here is the role of a PM, part of your main job, especially when it comes to engineers and design is to draw the perimeter for the team. Can you make that a little more real? What's an example of that maybe from something you worked on? What does that look like?

Kevin Yien (00:28:58):
Totally. The best word to describe the perimeter is just constraints. At the end of the day, you should be adding as many constraints as reasonable in order to let engineers and designers come up with the most creative solutions for whatever you're trying to do.

(00:29:15):
And so again, if we just stay focused on this point of sale example, one constraint would be, "Who the hell are we serving? Are we trying to go after sit-down restaurants that are serving five different courses and have a 200 item wine list? Or are we trying to serve the taco truck?" Those will lead to very different spaces. And if you leave both on the table, the lack of that constraint makes designing a good solution that much harder, that there instances where you actually can't apply that many constraints. But I bet that if you push on enough different axes, you eventually scope it down to a point where it feels really good for the team. It's just about how do you remove decisions, right? Because this I think is maybe a trite phrase, but the best decision is no decision. If you don't even have to think about the decision, the team is that much more effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
So yo give people a few maybe even pointers of, "I need to create more constraints maybe for my team to help them go crazy, but within this box that we all agree on," so you mentioned make sure the user's clear of who you're designing for. Is there anything else, just thinking about maybe the PRD someone's trying to write to help create this constraint? What other maybe bullet points, sections would you imagine or do you find useful to add?

Kevin Yien (00:30:25):
So beyond customer segment/like-what-their-specific-role is, I think another one would be, we can loosely call it, jobs to be done, even though I know that's becoming an increasingly loaded term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
Yeah, it's great.

Kevin Yien (00:30:36):
But what's the thing they're trying to do and how many different pathways are you willing to entertain around it? That's another one that I would think about. Depending on what you're building, there's availability. So do you care about desktop web, mobile web, native mobile, et cetera? And maybe another one to think through just as an example would be, this is probably getting closer to what a lot of people think about in terms of principles, but what are the things that you want to be known for when you ship a product? One example there might be speed. And so if you say speed is more important than consistency of data, that's a huge tradeoff and constraint that you can give the team." Oh my god, if an engineer hears I don't need real time consistency of data, I can do so much cool stuff and easily accomplish that speed thing." And so that's just a very technical example maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
Awesome. Okay, I'm glad I followed up on that. There's a couple more things you mentioned that I want to come back to real quick. The first is this tuning fork idea. I completely agree, this point you made, that the best way to get feedback from your team is to take a first pass at it, and here's a rough quick draft. I find with design, especially if you design something ugly, designers are often like, "Let me make that better. We can't stand this thing." Is there anything else you want to add there? Just this idea of tuning fork as a feedback strategy.

Kevin Yien (00:32:03):
Okay, there's two areas we can go deeper on here. One is in how you get the feedback. So this is definitely a Square-ism, I think it was probably adopted from Amazon, which is around the silent read of documents. When you are all so busy and someone's like, "I wrote a doc," you send it into the Slack ecosystem and everyone goes, "Please give feedback." You have so much going on... You'll be lucky to maybe get a response. Maybe there's one or two people that chime in.

(00:32:35):
And so even though we hate meetings and we love asynchronous, there is a lot of value to saying, "I need 20 minutes of focused time to interrogate something that I've done. We're not going to talk. I'm literally going to force us into a room or Zoom. You're going to read this doc, I'm going to watch you comment on it in real time. I'm going to respond to your comments in real time. And at the end of this thing I'm going to have enough really good input that I can do a huge rub on this thing and get to the next phase."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:08):
I love that. So it's basically instead of, "Hey, I'm sending you this doc to go review, give me feedback," it's, "I'm going to schedule a meeting, and the meeting is for you to spend time reviewing this doc and giving me feedback and then maybe we could talk about it."

Kevin Yien (00:33:19):
Yep. And I think a lot of people are going to hate hearing that because like, "Oh my god, I have so many meetings already. Why do I want another meeting that isn't even a meeting?" But that's the best kind then, because it's actual work getting done, right? And maybe you carve out two minutes at the end for one really immediate discussion topic or something. But I don't think we give enough space in any type of meeting for people to actually think. And when you are just staring at a doc with your camera off and the only expectation is to engage with that thing, thoughts are a little bit better and crisper.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
And I think with this idea, if someone says, "I want a meeting where you just sit and review this doc," you could always say, "Let me just review it asynchronously. I'll give you feedback, I promise. Give me 24 hours." Right? It's not like they have to come to this meeting.

Kevin Yien (00:34:07):
Although I would urge you to make them come to the meeting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):
Okay, say more there, because you find that that's a lot more effective.

Kevin Yien (00:34:14):
I think there's two sneaky things hiding behind that. One is the, "Yeah, I'll get to this in the next 24 hours." Maybe they don't. Maybe you've really trust that person and they're the exception. But beyond that, there is something else to the real time interaction that can happen when you're commenting and responding on a dock at the same time. I think this is the part that often gets lost, which is the latency between a comments or question and a quick follow-up from the author just pushes that cycle speed really long in a way that doesn't need to be. And so when people are trying to find how do you move faster, this actually is one of those very good examples of moving slower to move faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):
It reminds me Claire Vo, I think it was her phrase of moving one clock speed faster, and just like that's the way you speed up a company is try to move one clock speed faster, which in this case is just reduce the time between feedback and iteration. I love it.

(00:35:13):
Okay, I want to shift to talking about a few very tactical things that you've found really helpful in your PM career and something you recommend to other product teams. The first is something you call a decision log. You think every PM should keep a decision log. Talk about what that is and why that's powerful.

Kevin Yien (00:35:32):
I will say there's two different decision logs we could talk about. We'll focus on the former though. The latter is just as you're making decisions within your job, you should document those within a PRD. Make sure everyone knows. It's just a silly, very small thing, but I think every PM should do it.

(00:35:48):
The other decision log though that I think is quite critical is if we zoom out for a second, every person has something that they can do to slightly increment in their craft. Sprinters have certain exercises that they do. There's something beautiful about pianists and piano scales where it doesn't matter if you are just learning the piano or you are a 30-year veteran, you're still doing your scales, and it's because it lays the foundation for everything else that you need to do.

(00:36:23):
And so we all talk about product sense. It's this super mystical thing that no one knows how to get better at. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data, and the core of that is decisions. And so PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them. And so the natural followup would be, "Well, I only have to make X decisions in my job. How the hell do I make more of them?" Look around you. There's other teams that are making decisions. What would you do if you were in that position with the information you have? Great, write it down. Say why.

(00:37:06):
There's other companies that are doing crazy things. What are they doing? What would you do if you were responsible for the roadmap? Write it down. A year later, see what they've shipped. You can just do this for anyone. It's free, and no one takes the time to do it, but that's how I think you get better at actually making decisions, is just doing more of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:24):
Hearing you describe this, it feels like, "Obviously yes, why aren't we doing this? How else can we get better if we're not reflecting back on the decisions we've made? And realizing, "Hey, I made a bunch of bad decisions, but I'm always so confident in my decision still, maybe shouldn't be. So I guess first of all, do you actually do this? How often do you do this? And is there an example of you learning something from your own decision log?

Kevin Yien (00:37:50):
Many. And many of them because it was a wrong decision. But yes, I do keep a decision log. I have a separate sort of practice where it's just a daily log, which is everyone wants the perfect note-taking system. To me, the best note-taking system is inspired by... What is it called? big ass text file, BATF. There's a funny blog post from 2001 on it, but it's just, you write everything that happens to you in a day in a bolded list and it's all in one big note. That way you can command F it, do whatever you want. The way that I keep track of it is I do a little hashtag decision and then write things down just as I think about them. And then I'll have a reminder to comb back through on some cadence.

(00:38:36):
And so I'll first use a positive example, which is a funny one. So if you rewind to, I don't even know what year, but Shopify had just launched Shop app, their consumer application for what started as tracking your order when you bought something from a Shopify customer and then it's evolved into a full-blown Amazon competitor, where you can actually find merchants and buy things through it.

(00:39:03):
When they first launched it though, I was like, "Oh my God, this is so brilliant. They have completely hijacked this specific loop for consumer buying behavior via this very unassuming thing, which is package tracking." And so that morning I was like, "Whatever, I'm going to quickly draw a diagram of this flywheel that I think Amazon owns today. I'm going to show how Shopify is slowly planting their little seed to take over this and how Shop app fits into it." I tweeted out. And then I don't know, that day there must have been 60 Shopify employees that followed me. I was like, "What the hell is this guy talking about?"

(00:39:40):
And so funny enough, fast-forward, I've talked to some of the folks that worked on it and they're like, "Yeah, nailed it. Here's what we were thinking. Here's why." It's no longer secret sauce. But that was a really interesting example of both doing a decision log, putting my rationale down on paper. In this case, broadcasting it out, but then having that be a mechanism for it making its way back to me to actually better understand why did they make the decision versus what I thought, because the reasons were a little bit different, but the outcome was the same. So that's one interesting example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):
It's an amazing story. You doing this explains why you've been so successful. I could see how this all connects now. I think for a lot of people, they would want to build this habit. Clearly there's a lot of value here, but they just don't because they got a lot of other things going on or it's just like this new thing they have to start doing. Is there anything that helped you adopt this practice of this daily log/decision log that you think might be helpful to folks to motivate them to give this a shot?

Kevin Yien (00:40:40):
This is probably just general advice on building any habit, which is start small and just force yourself to do it. And there's that old saying around, how do you start running as a hobby? You don't do it by saying, "I'm going to run a mile every day." You do it by putting your sneakers at the foot of your bed unless you take your shoes off inside, then you put it at the front door, you have your shorts ready to go and you're like, "I commit to putting on my shorts. And if I decide after getting dressed to go run, that I still don't want to go run. Okay, fine." But you build up to that thing.

(00:41:16):
I think decision logs are the lightest weight thing possible. And so you can start super easy by saying, "You know what? Every Sunday morning I'm going to scroll through Twitter, I'm going to check out Hacker News, whatever it is, I'm going to see something interesting and I'm going to make a bet. I'm going to place my decision on this thing." Write it down, and then set a calendar invite in X weeks, X months to see what plays out. And that's all it is, right? 10 minutes once a week, super easy. And then over time you can crank it up. And then eventually you're just constantly writing these decisions down and then it's like feeding its way back into you. It becomes second nature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:52):
And you're touching on something that there's been a little bit of talk on this podcast and newsletter post about this idea of to get better product sense and product taste and also just decision making this case, one of the best strategies is to simulate other people's decisions and simulate what they're thinking through and predict what they're going to do, which is what you're describing here.

Kevin Yien (00:42:12):
Totally. I do want to apply a pretty severe caveat here though, which is, a decision log is not a replacement for building products. It's a additional complimentary thing that you can be doing on your own. But if you think that you can just sit back in your chair, look out at the market, make a bunch of calls and be like, "Look at how smart I'm getting without actually being hands-on with building a product," you're not actually going to get any better. So I just want to interject that

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:42):
Amazing caveat, very important. Don't just sit and read Hacker News and think you're going to be become an amazing founder or product leader.

(00:42:49):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments.

(00:44:07):
If someone wants to try this idea of a daily log, what is it exactly? Say decision log or daily log, is it just things that happen today and then hashtag, "Here's a decision I made, or here's a decision I think Shopify will make in the future"? Is that the format?

Kevin Yien (00:44:21):
Yeah, it depends on how far you want to go down productivity and notetaking as to rabbit holes, but let's start basic. This is not what I do, but I think it's the easiest place to start. Spin up a Google doc or a Notion page, just call it daily log and then bullet point out the date of today. And then as you're going through your day, you have a meeting, just type in the meeting name. If there's a takeaway, put it under there. If there's a decision you can make, do hashtag decision. And in this case, say, "Shopify launch Shop app. I think this is their way to take over the fulfillment to buying behavior loop. The reason for that is X, Y, Z." Follow up on this in six months and then set your calendar invite.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:02):
Awesome. So as motivation for listeners to try this sort of thing, just look at the success Kevin has had as in his career and how insightful he has been so far and will continue to be. And this is how these happen. This is how your mind learns to see things in a really unique, interesting way. So I know you're modest and aren't going to take any credit, but I'm just saying this is how you get better, is trying stuff like this.

Kevin Yien (00:45:24):
Footnote, correlation versus causation. It's all put out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:27):
Could be all genes. Could be completely unrelated to anything you've done entire life, I suspect.

Kevin Yien (00:45:33):
Could just be me being very lucky, I'll put that out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):
Could also be luck. Okay, so something I wanted to touch on with this decision log idea, and it's a segue to talking about hiring, is I think interviewing is also really good opportunity to try some like this. I feel like people interview lots of people. They think they know what they're looking for. They think they've made all these decisions. They think they have these amazing interview questions that are going to help them see really good signal, but you never actually go back and see, "Was I right? Should we have hired that person? Did this person work out? Was that question asked them at all inform? Was it at all a leading indicator of anything?" And I feel like this is a really good method for improving your interviewing abilities, is like, "Here's the questions asked. Here's what I decided. Here's what I think," and then a year later look back, "Was that actually right?"

Kevin Yien (00:46:16):
Yeah, totally. I think some of the best companies actually do have a practice around this where they have a 6, 12, 18 month check-in on new hires and they then compare their performance against level hired at and then review against the scorecards. It's a pretty laborious process. So startups aren't probably going to do it in the same amount of rigor, but it shows you so much about the holes in your interviewing process. So I definitely plus one of that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:50):
I love that. Oh my god, that puts all this pressure on your score, which is great. So that's actually a segue talking about hiring. There's a couple more tactics that I've seen you be really good at. So one is just hiring in general. You have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email where you try to convince someone not to join your company. Talk about that and why you think that's effective and then anything else along the lines of hiring you've learned.

Kevin Yien (00:47:11):
I'll say the idea of the unsell email came from a place of failure, which is at Square I had shifted into a position where I had to hire a lot of people really quickly. And through that, as a fairly new hiring manager, you're like, "All right, great. I've been told the goal is to hire fast." Okay, you give me a metric, you're going to go after it. So you do your best to get as many people in the door as possible. When you're talking to your recruiting partner, they're incentivized to increase pass through rates, offer to close rates, all these other things, and so they're like, "Yeah, this person's really good." And you listen. "Yeah, they are pretty good, aren't they?" Even though there's a sneaking suspicion that maybe they're not the right fit, but you move forward anyways.

(00:47:54):
So fast-forward, there's a few folks I bring on, and within six months they come to me and they're like, "This is not at all what I thought I was going to do. This is not the environment I thought I was going to walk into. You didn't warn me about this, that and the other. I feel terrible. How do I prevent this?" And the reason it's bad is not just because they feel surprised, but because then, either one, they decide to leave, two, they're not performing because it's not the right role or environment for them, or three, maybe the company is still good, but that role isn't. And so they immediately try to do internal mobility or something to another team, which then leaves you with the same hole. So all of those bad outcomes. [inaudible 00:48:37] "How do I prevent this?" Well, I just got to front load all the gnarly stuff they're going to find out in their first six months.

(00:48:44):
And so the practice I started developing is you go through the whole interview process. During that period, you're collecting all these little concerns, fears, anxieties that they're not explicitly saying, but they're definitely hinting at. You got to be pretty honest with yourself about which ones are real. But then when you get to offer stage, I send an email with no more than eight bullet points and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. I'm pretty candid about, "This is what it's like here." Maybe one example would be, "Hey, I'm a parent and I'm worried about work-life balance." Maybe they don't say that explicitly in the interview process, but you get a feeling for it. And I get that as a parent too.

(00:49:31):
So if I'm at a startup, I'll be really clear and I'll say, "You know what? We are a series A startup. We are pushing really hard at product-market fit. The expectation here is going to be that you're online at 10:00, that you can occasionally hop on a meeting on a Saturday or Sunday." And if you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join, you find yourself an A+ hire. But if they read that and they're like," I don't know anymore," it's way better to say, "Great, this is not a good fit. Let's go our separate ways" than have them leave after six months.

(00:50:08):
When I first instituted this, I lost 30% of candidates at offer stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):
Oh wow.

Kevin Yien (00:50:13):
Which drove my recruiting partners insane because they look terrible. Their manager is like, "What the hell are you doing? You're losing everyone at the very end." And so they ask, "Can you either not send this thing?" Or, "Can you send it at the very beginning?" And my answer is no, because I don't know what they're afraid of yet. I have to go through the whole process to actually understand the thing that's going to potentially make them say no, and that's really crucial I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):
But once you hear it again, this is such an obviously good idea, clearly not an easy thing to do. In this case where recruiters were upset, is it just get buy-in from folks above, like, "Okay, this sucks for them, but at a macro level, this is good for the business" and they're like, "All right, let's keep doing it"?

Kevin Yien (00:50:55):
At Square, at least, when I first started doing it, luckily I had a very good relationship with them. So that's a good starting point. This is maybe going to come across a little bit flippant, but they can't stop you from sending an email technically. So I'm just going to send the email. And if someone really wants to come and say, "This is bad for business," whatever it is, I have very strong reasons for why that's not the case. And now I've done it so many times, at least, that I can point to very clear proof points on why this is the right path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:27):
In theory, the incentives would be aligned where the recruiter success matters. It's based on, did they actually have a good time? Did they stay? Did they have good impact?

Kevin Yien (00:51:35):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):
But since they're not, obviously incentives aren't right.

Kevin Yien (00:51:39):
I think some companies have shifted on that, where recruiters and salespeople are compensated sometimes in similar ways in terms of quota and whatnot. And so they'll hold the recruiter accountable to six, 12 post offer tenure before they say, "Oh yeah, you successfully landed this role." So you can tweak the incentive structure a little bit, but not everyone does that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):
Okay. So the advice here is to end up with better people that end up being successful and happy. Keep track of the things that will probably be painful for them at the company, and then craft an email that shares upfront, "Here's what made be a problem if you join, and I just want to be very upfront about it." I think you actually shared a template of one of these emails in one of your blog posts.

Kevin Yien (00:52:25):
Yep, that's right. I have a fairly real one in [inaudible 00:52:30].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:29):
Is there anything else hiring-wise? I know there's probably infinite things that you've done, but is there anything else you think might be worth sharing of things you've learned to be more successful at hiring awesome people?

Kevin Yien (00:52:39):
One final note I'll make on unsell email is it's not as if you just send the email and then they either say yes or no. Most of the time they will say, "Thank you. I am cool with six of these. This one freaks me out. Can we talk more?" Definitely. And I think this is where hiring managers have an incredible responsibility that sometimes isn't taken as seriously as it should, which is, when you are working with someone to get them to join or to offer, you need to bend to do whatever it takes for them. And so if they're like, "Hey, the only time I can talk is tonight at 11 o'clock after my kids go to bed."

(00:53:18):
"No problem. Here's my phone number, let's hop on. I will walk you through whatever you want to talk about." That sort of has to be the place you get to for really strong hires. So that's just one other thing I'll say.

(00:53:29):
The meta point around that is you need to be really invested in the candidates. This probably does change at a certain scale, like if you're "organization" is hiring a hundred engineers or whatever, you have process around it, you have pipelines, there's a machine at that point, but I do think the direct hiring managers have a responsibility to be really involved in every individual, because there's no one who's directly hiring a hundred people. It's always within a number that I think you can take on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:01):
Okay, so this is the final tactic that I heard you're amazing at, which is automating user research. On the surface this sounds amazing. "I'm going to automate my user research. It's going to be amazing. So great." Talk about why you find this really powerful and important. And then how do you actually do this? How do you automate user research? How have you done this on your teams?

Kevin Yien (00:54:17):
Let's start from why this even matters. I think a lot of folks, going back to what is the point of product management, I think there's a similar overlap with UXR, like user experience research, and people will say, "Well, if they're doing research, what do I need to do? I should just be consuming what they're producing to help with that."

(00:54:39):
I know PM should settle for looking through bent glass in my opinion because whether it's a research report, whether it's something a salesperson is telling you, whether it's market research, don't care, it's been processed by someone, and PMs need direct exposure to raw material. End of story. And so that's where I think you just need to constantly be talking to or interacting with whoever is your customer. That's the foundation.

(00:55:08):
So okay, if we all agree on that, then the question is, "Well, I don't have time. It's so hard. How do I find them? My customer success manager says I can't talk to the client." If you are in a situation where the product manager is literally not allowed to talk to a customer, there is something structurally wrong and that needs to be fixed first. So I'm going to ignore that one for now just because that's a whole other rabbit hole, but you need to fix that in order to even get close to the next thing.

(00:55:38):
Okay, now the excuse is going to be, "Well, I don't have time. I don't want to run a program. I don't want to have to query and look up and send out emails every week." There's so many good resources out there right now, and I think that there are... I'll speak mainly from a B2B sense. I think B2C, slightly different story, I don't have as much experience there. But B2B, the two things I will say, one is, there's this thing called userinterviews.com. Shout out to them. They're pretty much user testing but explicitly focused on B2B and you can put in super clear criteria on the type of people you want to talk to. They do the heavy lifting and sourcing it, and then you just review and say, "Yes, yes. No, no," and you can have a steady stream of the exact ICP, you want to go after. ICP is ideal customer profile that you want to go after just coming to you automatically. Amazing.

(00:56:28):
The next one though, it depends on whether or not you have this tooling in place, but the broader theme behind this next category is your sales team is a research team, and if you don't view them that way, you are missing out on half the value. And so there's tools like Gong, which do call recordings, and you can set up filters and alerts for specific terms, phrases, competitors, whatever you want. I don't care what PM you are in the team. You can find the terms that are associated with what you care about the most. Those then get pushed automatically to a Slack channel or otherwise. And then you can set up workflows either via Zappy or something else to say, "Who was the customer? Pull their email, put that into a sequence, drop in my Calendly" and you just have interviews showing up automatically on your calendar. I will say I cannot take credit for this. Shout out to Beth Hills who was a PM that hired at Mutiny. She is the queen of automating customer research and built an amazing system around this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:28):
So the way it works is you set a term for like, I don't know, POS, point of sale, something in Gong, and if somebody says that or has an issue there, talk about again how that schedules a meeting with you potentially.

Kevin Yien (00:57:42):
Yes. So Gong has an integration with Slack. You set up this alert, it posts to Slack the excerpt of the transcript where it was mentioned along with the user or customer name. So in this case, it'll be Lenny's Burger shop. lenny@lennysburgershop.com, and then you can set up a Zapier to take every new Slack post from that and then send using, I don't know, customer.io in email to that person using that field. And then in that template of the email, drop in your Calendly specifically for user research.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:21):
Wow, that is genius. I love that. There's another similar tactic that Teresa Torres shared on the podcast in one of the earlier episodes where you have a little popup on your homepage asking people, "Hey, do you want to talk? We'd love to hear feedback on our product. Click here if you want to give us some feedback," and then that schedules Calendly on the PMs.

Kevin Yien (00:58:41):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
PM's calendar. So you mentioned Gong, customer.io. There's some tools here. Zapier obviously. Is there anything else you find useful to help automate the sort of stuff?

Kevin Yien (00:58:52):
If I take a step back from the automation side or maybe straddle it, depending on the type of business you're in, there's ideally people talking about you somewhere, right? It's either happening on Reddit or Twitter or on some forum or your support forum. There is a community, there's a destination somewhere. And if there isn't, then I don't know, that's too bad. Maybe you don't have product-market fit. If you can take advantage of that, you can usually set up something. And if it's not a Gong or a Zapier, maybe it needs to be just a custom script that you write or you sit down with an engineer to say like, "How do we set up alerting around this thing so that I know when things are happening?"

(00:59:36):
I think you can't use the effort required to do that as an excuse to not be talking to your customers more frequently. Because again, if we go back to a product manager should be trying to convert this potential into kinetic energy, part of that understanding and part of knowing the constraints you can apply is just living in that world as much as possible.

(00:59:59):
The best comparison I can give is, there is a world of difference between reading a report about a lime cook and then standing with a lime cook. You will just pick up on so many ancillary aspects of what their life is like that cannot possibly be communicated in a report. You owe it to yourself as a PM to be exposed to those things all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):
In my experience, every time I talk to a customer, I'm always reminded, "Why have I not been doing this more? How can I not be doing this? It's absurd that I haven't done this," like every time you actually do it. But until you do that, you're like, "No, no, I know what they want. I'm reading all the customer service talent issues, I'm reading their emails, I get it." Until you actually talk to them, you're like, "Oh wow, I had no idea."

(01:00:51):
I love that your advice is like, the tactics you're sharing aren't, "Here's how you get a bunch of feedback." From your users, it's like, "Here's how you actually get to talk to the right users." It's like in the end of the funnel talking to a potential customer. It's not just reading a cool... some feedback that they shared.

Kevin Yien (01:01:07):
That's right. I think just like the last point on this one is when you join a new team or start a new role, every PM is budding with energy to do this, "Of course I'm going to talk to my users." But then you reach a point where you go, "No, I know them inside and out. I don't need to talk to them anymore. I can write a PRD in my sleep. And I'm so busy doing both, product improvements, maintenance, annual planning, something else.I can use my intuition from the hundred interviews I've already done. I don't need to do one more interview." And that is a very tempting lie to tell yourself because the world is changing, their lives are changing, and you need to constantly be exposed to those little micro changes in their lives in order to build the product that they'll eventually need.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):
The best explanation I've heard of this is actually from your new boss, Patrick Collison, boss's boss's boss, I don't know how far away you're from him, where he talks about user research and where it fits in. And the way he described it is, instead of doing user research, talking to customers, informing what to build, it's talking to user, talking to customers informs your mental of what the customer needs and then that informs what to build.

Kevin Yien (01:02:23):
100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:24):
Beautiful way to think about it.

(01:02:26):
Okay, so I'm going to take us to a couple recurring themes of this podcast, a couple corners of this room that we have. First of all, I want to go to AI corner, so let's walk over there. Hello, AI corner. I'm curious if you've found any interesting uses of AI in your work or in your life.

Kevin Yien (01:02:46):
There's plenty in work. I don't know if any of them are interesting or novel. I feel like everyone's just figuring it out in real time together. So I'll actually take us in a slightly different direction. And this may be isn't directly useful to product managers, but I think it's a really good story.

(01:03:02):
So when Midjourney V1 was released, if we can remember that far back, it was at least I got beta access on a Saturday. And for what's worth, I have three daughters, one of them's seven years old, and so her and I were awake. We were waiting for the other two to wake up and I was like, "Oh, I have this cool new thing. Do you want to play with me?" And she goes, "Of course." So we log in, we create an account and I type in the first prompt, image gets generated, it's like a rainbow or something. And then I ask her, "Do you want to try it?" She goes, "Of course." So she types in unicorn prancing in a field and it generates this hideous looking demented unicorn with two rear ends and a demon flying over it. And I'm appalled at first thinking that she's going to feel really bad about what she got shown, but instead I look over and she's in awe. She is amazed.

(01:04:04):
And then she turns to me and she goes, "Did I draw that?"

(01:04:06):
"Yeah, I guess you did." And the thing that I got hung up on was that she used the word draw. She didn't say, "Oh, I enter a prompt and the LLM produced this thing," or whatever weird terminology that all of us use. It's like, "Did I draw that?" I don't know when it clicked for me, but at some point in time after that I was like, "The concept of these image generation models is the same as a crayon to her. There is no difference in her mind." And that is an insane change that I can't even comprehend. And so for me that's just been I think an experience that I go back to when I think about people asking, "What do you think AI is going to do and what's the next thing? And is it chat or is it something else?" I cannot comprehend what a child who grew up with a crayon of an LLM is going to think is a good product in 20 years. I need to start crying. But goddammit, I have no freaking clue.

(01:05:11):
And so I think I have a cheat code actually as a parent, because I get to see how they evolve and use these tools in real time. But all I can say is we are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:29):
Wow, that is an amazing story, it gave me tingles. It makes me think a little bit about how we used to code in binary and then assembly and now it's Java, and then I don't know, all the languages, Python. And now it's like AI, LLM generating code and it's the same thing for drawing potentially. It used to be sticks on a cave and then became crayons and pens and iPads and all that stuff. And now it's again LLMs, so that's pretty bonkers. Amazing story. Thanks for sharing that. Useful to PMs and non PMs alike.

(01:06:06):
Okay, I'm going to take you to another recurring corner/segment of the podcast, fail corner. I'm curious if there's a story of failure that you can share of something that didn't go the way you wanted and still had a positive impact on your life or career?

Kevin Yien (01:06:25):
Well, there's countless stories of failure, but I'll choose the one that I think I've had to reference the most with people and has been to date the most difficult one to really talk about. I'm on the other end of it, and so now it's very easy, but it took several years to get there.

(01:06:44):
So context, I'm [inaudible 01:06:47] my way to PM, I land my first official, by title, PM job at a startup. I made it. I've arrived. I'm officially a product manager. And we go up, we go down, all the things happen. Fast-forward, the company is really struggling and so we go through a series of rolling layoffs and I'm round 4 something. At that point in time, my wife was nine months pregnant with our first child, and so I am freaking out. There is the personal side that I'm worried about, but then there's also my identity that has been completely crushed, because in the moment all I could think was, "I thought I was a product manager. This is evidence I am not," and I couldn't get past that.

(01:07:37):
And so for what it's worth, this is the one post I have on my website that I actually feel really, really proud of. It's called Finding Swagger. I can talk about why it's titled that way, but it's the thing that I really wrote more for myself because it's a good reminder to me every time I fall into this mentality again, because that may have been the first time that I really had the feelings of, "I'm not worth it" or, "I'm not meant to be this person," but it's recurred several times since then over the past decade. And when I read back through my mentality of how I got to the other end of it, it helps even myself sort of get back on the horse.

(01:08:28):
So okay, I get laid off, I'm distraught, I have no purpose, I'm nothing. And it was through a lot of reflection, a lot of conversation with friends and my wife where you eventually need to convince yourself that there is a difference between you not being good at something and a business or company not needing that thing at a particular moment in time, or you being very good at something but not in the way that a company needs.

(01:09:01):
And so I think once I was able to get to that, Square for me was the immediate subsequent role that I took on. And I went into that thing just full steam ahead, I'm going to prove myself. "I know I'm good," because I think I'm good, "and I am going to prove the hell out of that" mainly to myself, but ideally to other people too.

(01:09:24):
I think you shouldn't do things for other people for validation, but the initial success I got to see in launching a product, gaining the trust of my peers, having something that restaurants were texting me about, saying, "I can start my restaurant because of this. I didn't go down during rush hour because of this," that gave me the validation to say, "Okay, I am competent at this thing called product management." And then from there you can continue to build and continue to grow.

(01:09:53):
But I think right now, the market's weird, right? The market's wonky. There's a lot of really good talent that is just getting hit over sideways. I have a lot of friends that are having the same mental conversations around, "Well, I guess I'm just not worth it. I guess I wasn't cut out actually to do this job, do this role, be of this purpose." In some cases, maybe that's true and you can sort of have a career transition or a pivot in your life, but I think it's worthwhile to reflect on what are the things that were in your control that you can now change moving forward? And then what are the things that were truly out of your control that you can now apply to find a better fit? And that's one of the big things that I've been able to, I think, come around to.

(01:10:41):
And it's really hard because early on I think it's very tempting to associate a lot of different things with your identity. You're like, "I'm a startup guy. I'm a PM, I'm a fast whatever, I'm a fast thinker." And when an event happens that pokes at that part of your identity, the rest of it crumbles. And so long story short, I think it's really important for folks to use these moments where it feels bad and feels like a failure to reevaluate what parts are actually part of your identity and which parts are in your control to change in whatever you do next.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
Wow, what an important and great story. As you mentioned, a lot of people are dealing with finding it hard to find a new gig and a bunch of layoffs. I think this is going to help a lot of people. The two categories you shared I think are especially powerful. So the advice here is just separate, "This company just doesn't need someone with my skills right now" from, "I'm not good at these skills." Can you just share those two kind of things that might be true that you may not be recognizing about why they maybe laid you off again?

Kevin Yien (01:11:52):
Totally. So one is the business just doesn't have a need for you. They got ahead of their skis and that's their fault. They probably admit that, but that's not up to you. The second one though is my skills and the way that company operates are not compatible. This one I think is really, really important because I've seen so many times where there's been a PM engineer, designer, whatever role, they cannot make it work at company A, and then you see them five years later just killing it in company B and you're like, "Did they change as a person? Did they get super good at what they were bad at before?" Maybe a little bit, but honestly it was just a change in environment. And when you find the right environment in the right role, you just flourish.

(01:12:40):
And I think this is actually... Sorry, we'll go back to hiring for just a moment or at least management.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:44):
Please.

Kevin Yien (01:12:45):
This is why performance conversations can always feel so difficult because it seems like you're telling someone you are bad, and as the recipient you're like, "I am bad." No one wants to hear that. But the reality is, you are not bad. It is that maybe the way that your environment is working, the machine that you exist as a part of, is not the kind that you thrive in. And so it's within your control to decide, "I'm going to change how I work to fit that environment" or, "I'm going to find a different environment that actually fits the way I work much better." And that's empowering.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):
I think that also applies a lot to interviewing. A lot of times you interview, don't get the job, and you exactly feel like, "Oh, I'm just not good enough." But really that company's way of working just may not gel with the way you operate. Like Uber operates very differently from Airbnb, operates very differently from Google. And so it's not that necessarily something you're doing wrong, they just don't think you're fit.

(01:13:46):
And this connects to something. I just had another guest on the podcast. He was a brain science dude, and he talks about how every company has this kind of habitat. What habitat are you creating for your employees to enable them to think differently or to be shut down and not feel like they can be creative or try big things or not? And basically, the way he just kind of to leverage that metaphor, like you may be a palm tree and you're trying to join Antarctica and it's not going to go well.

Kevin Yien (01:14:16):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:17):
You got to find Palm Springs or some hard place. Kevin, this has been amazing. Okay, so before we get to very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think is important or valuable to share, leave listeners with? And if not, absolutely.

Kevin Yien (01:14:30):
I think we'll probably find ourselves on interesting detours to the lightning round, so let's roll in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:35):
Kevin, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kevin Yien (01:14:39):
Hell, yeah. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):
Let's do it. Question one, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kevin Yien (01:14:46):
I'll start by saying the type of book by volume that I read and get the most joy from are autobiographies and memoirs. It is just the ultimate cheat code to spend time with people that you respect, are interested by, or want to learn from.

(01:15:05):
Could you imagine what it would take in real life to sit down with Albert Einstein for 50 hours and just have him talk to you about his life? Impossible. But you can read and pretty much get the same thing.

(01:15:21):
So anyways, strong requirement or a strong suggestion, go read autobiographies and memoirs of people that you respect, mostly for their mental model and way to approach thinking, less about specific things. But the one book that I read without fail every year has a very misleading title. It's called The Courage to Be Disliked. I think it's been mentioned previously on the podcast, but it covers... It's a very Socratic method style, so it's about a philosopher and a young person, and it tries to teach you the ways of Adlerian psychology, which is sort of counter to Jungian theory.

(01:15:56):
The reason I really like it is because it makes me uncomfortable. So the whole premise, in my opinion, behind the book and other in psychology is focus on what you control. That's the one line. Don't worry about everything else. Don't worry about what other people think. Don't worry about what other people do. You cannot control those. You focus on yourself and you focus on the actions you can take. And be the person that you think will attract other people, that you want to be around.

(01:16:29):
There's some really pointed notes in there that I'm like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha. I don't fully agree with that one," but it always pushes me to question something about what I believe. And so in every physical copy of a book I have, I write the date that I started reading it again. The front inside cover of this book, I think it's been seven or eight years at this point that I've read it every single year.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
Wow. It's like a decision logging in another context almost.

Kevin Yien (01:16:59):
Yeah, a little bit. I would say the other book I was going to mention is The Paper Menagerie. This actually shout out to Sean Rose for... I've never met him, but I really appreciate Sean. He was one of the early, if not, first PMs of Slack, and he used to be really loud on Twitter in a very good way, and I think I learned a ton from stuff that he would post. But one of the things that he posted was this book. It is just the most beautiful collection of essays that span sci-fi and fantasy. And so if you're into that kind of stuff, if you like exhalation, then Paper Menagerie is even better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:39):
Oh, shit. Guess I got to add this book to my list. I do love exhalation.

Kevin Yien (01:17:43):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:45):
Oh, man, this job is tough. I get to learn all these amazing books and then I got to read them, but I don't have time. Hard.

(01:17:51):
Speaking of more time, next question. Do you have any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you really enjoyed?

Kevin Yien (01:17:57):
There's less time for either these days. I will say not novel, the Bear holds a very special place in my heart right now, both because I worked in restaurants and I got to build for them. And so seeing the details that they do actually gives me a lot of anxiety, but I really appreciate the craft they put into it.

(01:18:16):
The other show, actually, I think this is the first time, Physical 100. So this is a Netflix show. It's a Korean show about a hundred different bodybuilders, athletes, what have you, on who has the optimum physique or whatever. I don't really care about that part. The two things I love about the show are, one, it's ridiculous what people are capable of. You see what they can physically do and you're like, "Oh my God, that's amazing what they can put their minds to." The other part though, and this is maybe a trend of Korean shows that I've noticed, is the amount of respect they have in this competition is bar none. You have this guy who is historically famous, was the top champion in judo or something, and you have all these other athletes that are 15, 20 years younger, and they're bowing and just humble to compete against the guy. I kind of wish that more American Joes had that level of respect as opposed to just trying to find the most conflict. There's something that I really like about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:25):
That's beautiful. I've started that show, but I haven't continued it, so I'm going to revisit it.

Kevin Yien (01:19:30):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:30):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Kevin Yien (01:19:34):
We got a really old 2002 Jeep to work on with my daughters, just like a true junker. And as a result of that, we're repairing it. We're taking off the rust, replacing parts, and so there's these little magnetic trays that you can hold screws and nails and whatnot, so they don't go flying and rolling around everywhere. It's stupidly useful when you're working on a car. And the girls love it because they can use it for other things like collecting hair clips or whatever else. So magnetic trays, shout out.

(01:20:06):
And then selfishly, I will say my buddy Arjun Mahanti has an app called Circuit. If you search the app store for Circuit, like C-I-R-C-U-I-T, HIIT timer, it's such a delightful little app that lets you track Tabata sex or whatever else to just get a little workout in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:24):
Super cool. Magnetic tray is not boring at all. That is extremely cool and it has a really cool story too. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful to share with friends and family in work or in life?

Kevin Yien (01:20:36):
I think we've actually maybe touched on both of these. I'll cheat and I'll pull one from maybe each parent so that in case they see this, they don't feel like I'm favoring one of them.

(01:20:45):
So my mom's side, I think something that she would always repeat to me growing up is everything happens for a reason. I hated that growing up because she only said it when something bad would happen. Something bad happens, she goes, "Everything happens for a reason," and I'm like, "No, it doesn't. Life just sucks." And to no surprise at this point in the conversation, I've now grown to really, really appreciate that piece of advice because what it's actually trying to communicate is, when something happens, good or bad, frankly, don't dwell on it. That's the past. Focus on what you want to do and then just move towards that. And then in most cases, you'll be able to look back in one, five, 10 years and connect the dots in a way where the story makes sense in your mind. And so just having that shift in perspective I think has helped me a lot to not overreact to anything that happens in my life. So that's one side.

(01:21:46):
And then on my dad's side, so the funny origins of this, unsurprising to anyone with Asian parents, I'm a spunky little 7-year-old, I come home with my math test one day. I got 97%. I think that's pretty good. I go show it to my dad with beaming eyes and pride. He sort of stares down his nose at it, looks at me, "Where's my other 3%?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:08):
Oh, my God.

Kevin Yien (01:22:10):
I'm just distraught and I sulk away. I'm very sad. I study hard. I do the next math test, I get 100% yes. All right, dad's approval, here we come. I come flying back, I put the test in his hands, he stares down his nose at it, looks at me, "Where's my other 3%?" I'm so confused. I'm like, "I got 100 out of 100. I have no clue what you're talking about." He just looks me down the eye and goes, "Who said a hundred is the most you can get?" At that age, I literally had no clue what he was talking about. And he had to reframe it for me in the moment around like, "Well, was there extra credit? Can you just write your own problems to challenge yourself more? Could you have given yourself another test? And maybe the teacher won't give you credit, but you give yourself credit for doing additional work."

(01:23:01):
I think I carry that theme forward where there's this weird transition we all go through from childhood to adulthood where we no longer receive homework, we're responsible for defining the work that we do. And when you do that, if all you do is the minimum of what defined the 100% of what your job requires, you'll never grow. And so it's up to you to actually find what is the additional 3%? There's always three more percent. So that's my dad's lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Kevin, you're blowing my mind. There's so many great stories, you're just full of them. And I feel like this lesson also applies really well to product and building product and founding companies.

Kevin Yien (01:23:46):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):
Just pushing further than people expect and making it a lot more delightful than the minimum bar.

(01:23:53):
Final question, speaking of things that maybe people don't expect and may not understand is possible, looking at you, nobody would've guessed that you're a competitive eater at some point in your life. As a final question, tell us about this part of your life. What did you eat? How does this work? How far did you get in this path?

Kevin Yien (01:24:12):
It's probably misleading to say that I was a true competitive eater. I wasn't on the circuit with a... I forget his name, but Johnny Chestnut.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
[inaudible 01:24:21]. Oh yeah, Chestnut

Kevin Yien (01:24:22):
Back in the day, that's like the OG competitive eater on the hotdog circuit, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:25):
Right.

Kevin Yien (01:24:26):
For me it was more eating challenges. And so whenever I would travel, I would find the local eating challenge, whether it was time-based, volume-based, something else, and just try to see what I could push my body to do. I was blessed with a great metabolism, so I never really had to worry too much about anything else. And the origin, the first moment of this was when I was 14, my sister was going to college in Minnesota and there's this steakhouse up there called Manny's, which is where the Vikings Frontline goes to after every game. And they have this ridiculous 97 ounce order house. I don't know how many pounds that is, but it's too much meat for a human to consume.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:26):
97 ounce.

Kevin Yien (01:25:07):
97 ounces, yeah. And so I sit down, I order it thinking, "This is going to be great." They put it in front of me, it's a monster. You have to eat in under an hour. And so 45 minutes into it, I'm halfway through and about to die. And the catch is, if you finish it in under an hour, you get it for free. And so my dad again leans in and goes, "You can't afford not to finish this."

(01:25:39):
And so, "Message received, sir." Hunker down. I plowed the other half in 15 minutes. I then slept for I think three days afterwards. But after that I was like, "Oh my God, if I could do that, what else could I do?" And so, [inaudible 01:25:54] carried for, I don't know, nearly a decade of trying to do these interesting challenges.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):
Wow. I don't know how that's physically possible, but clearly you did it.

(01:26:02):
Kevin, this has been wonderful. I think there's so many lessons here for people in so many ways, life and work and parenting. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow you and learn more from you over time? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Kevin Yien (01:26:17):
I'm on Twitter, just @kevinyien. Technically, I'm on LinkedIn. I don't post over there. I probably should. I hear it's very good. But that's where you can find me. Also, my website. I don't write that often, and I don't have an RSS feed, which has always been on my backlog, and I'm always too lazy to do. But one day I will add it.

(01:26:38):
One quick note, I'll actually make on websites. So on one hand, I love all the different website builders that exist. It's amazing what we've enabled anyone to be able to do. There is something really special about having your corner of the internet that you built sort of hand by hand, line by line. And so my website is, it's a GitHub page. It's hosts on GitHub pages, but it's just raw HTML, CSS, nothing fancy. I get so much joy every year just doing a slight tweak or cleaning of it. And so I really do recommend that for anyone with the curiosity and the desire to buy your domain, even if you're never going to write anything on it, you're never going to share it out, just own a little piece of the internet. It feels good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:28):
I love that. I didn't know that about your website. And I could see it now as I go there. It's .html, which you don't see as much anymore.

Kevin Yien (01:27:35):
Exactly. [inaudible 01:27:37].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
And then... Yeah, can listeners be useful to you.

Kevin Yien (01:27:39):
This is going to sound trite, and it has nothing to do with product necessarily, just be kind. Make for a nicer world, right? Say thank you a little bit more often. Hold the door open a little more often. Wave if you cut someone off in a car. I think there is a temptation and incentive structure to create conflict intention. And in most cases, the world would just benefit from a little bit more kindness.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:06):
What an incredibly beautiful way its ended. Kevin, this was so much fun. I'm so glad we did this. Thank you so much for coming on.

Kevin Yien (01:28:13):
Thank you for having me.

## Transcript

Kim Scott (00:00:00):
If you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" Do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Today my guest is Kim Scott. Kim is the author of Radical Candor, which is the single most referenced book on this podcast. The book has sold over 1 million copies, has been translated into twenty-three languages. It was such an honor to have Kim on the podcast. Prior to this book, Kim was a CO coach at Dropbox, Qualtrics, Twitter and many other tech companies. She was a member of the faculty at Apple University. Before that, she led AdSense, YouTube and DoubleClick teams at Google. Prior to that, Kim managed a pediatric clinic in Kosovo and started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow. She's also working on a new book that you can pre-order now called Radical Respect. In our conversation, we get very practical and very tactical about practicing radical candor. Kim briefly describes the core idea, shares, language and phrases and words you can use to get better at practicing radical candor.

(00:01:24):
She shares tips for people-pleasers like myself. Also, a lot of very concrete advice for how to get feedback. Also, what to do if your culture is on the ruinous empathy side of the spectrum, or even worse, obnoxious aggression and so much more. I guarantee listening to this episode will make you a better leader and a better employee. With that, I bring you Kim Scott after a short word from our one featured sponsor for this episode.

(00:01:50):

(00:03:13):
Kim, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:17):
Thank you for having me. I'm excited for our conversation.

Lenny (00:03:20):
Your book, Radical Candor is the single most recommended book on this podcast. I don't know if you know this podcast well, but at the end of the podcast, I ask every guest, "What are two or three books you recommend most to other people?" And your book has come up the most of any book mentioned on the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:37):
Amazing. Well, tell your listeners I love them and I'm grateful to them.

Lenny (00:03:45):
Okay, they'll hear this. So I'm really excited to have you on chat about all the things that you teach and your book. For people that have heard the term Radical Candor, have maybe skimmed the book, maybe even read the book a while ago, but don't truly remember or understand the concept. Could you just spend just a few minutes giving a high level overview of the concept of Radical Candor?

Kim Scott (00:04:04):
Absolutely. Radical Candor is just what happens when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time. And I think it's probably best understood by what it's not because we all fail on one of those two dimensions or both of them multiple times a day. So you can think about it as a two by two framework. On the vertical axis is care personally, the horizontal axis is challenge directly. What happens when we remember to challenge directly, but we forget to show that we care personally. That is what I call obnoxious aggression, and it's really important to distinguish between radical candor and obnoxious aggression. I think one of the mistakes that people often make about, and I've gotten a lot, you write a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it, and I've heard a lot of feedback that sometimes teams will be rolling out the idea of Radical Candor and someone will charge into the room and say, "In the spirit of Radical Candor," and then they act like a garden variety jerk.

(00:05:00):
And that is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That's the spirit of obnoxious aggression. And obnoxious aggression is a big problem. It's a problem because it hurts other people. It's also a problem because it's inefficient. If I'm a jerk to you Lenny, then I'm going to send you into fight or flight mode and then you literally cannot hear what I'm saying, so I'm wasting my breath. But I don't know if this is true for you, but for me, there's a third problem. And the third problem is that when I realize I've acted like a jerk, when I realize I've landed in obnoxious aggression, it's not actually my instinct to go the right way on care personally. Instead, it's my instinct to go the wrong way on challenge directly and to pretend that I agree when I disagree, and then I wind up in the worst place of all, manipulative insincerity.

(00:05:48):
And it's kind of fun to tell stories about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. If you watch The Office or any show about problems at work or problems in any kind of relationship really, you're going to see a lot of episodes about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. But I think the real rub comes and the fact that these, even though this is what we like to talk about, these two problems are what we like to talk about, these are not the most common problem. By far and away the most common problem occurs when we do remember to show that we care personally because you know what? Most people try to be nice people. So we do remember to show that we care personally, but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings or not offending them, that we fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run. And that is what I call ruinous empathy. So that is Radical Candor in a nutshell. That's the TLDR. But please do read.

Lenny (00:06:40):
Amazing and we'll link to a diagram of this two by two for people that aren't visual thinkers and want to actually see it. So just to make it super clear, if you're challenging directly, basically being very candid with feedback, but it's not clear you care deeply about the person, you call that obnoxious aggression.

Kim Scott (00:06:40):
Yes.

Lenny (00:06:57):
And if you make it clear, you care a lot about the person but aren't actually giving them direct candid feedback, you call that ruinous empathy.

Kim Scott (00:07:05):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:07:06):
Which of these buckets do you find most people fall into? Is there a percentage of people or companies?

Kim Scott (00:07:11):
Yeah, I mean, I would say 90% of us make 90% of our mistakes in that ruinous empathy bucket. It's by far and away the most common problem. But I think all of us make mistakes in the other quadrants as well. And very often we kind of, I think one of, if I'm going to offer some self-criticism of this framework, it's much easier to notice when one has been ruinously empathetic. It's almost like, give yourself some critical feedback. "I work too hard." But it's much harder to notice when we've been manipulatively insincere and obnoxiously aggressive. And maybe I could have named those things because very often manipulative insincerity is sort of self-protective insincerity. Very often obnoxious aggression is just extreme frustration. So I want people to use this framework not to judge themselves or other people harshly, but like a compass to guide specific conversations with specific people to a better place and to help us understand when we're going in the wrong direction, which we are all bound to do on a daily basis.

Lenny (00:08:26):
I want to talk about all those things and also how to get better at these things. But before we do that, it's very hard to change. And it's also hard just to challenge directly innately, it's hard for people to be candid, just to give people a little motivation to invest in this skill. What sort of impact do you see when people develop the skill of being better at radical candor?

Kim Scott (00:08:48):
When we get better at radical candor? I mean, I'll tell you a story in fact about the impact it had on my life, some radical candor, but the sort of abstract answer to your question is we build better relationships and we do better work and we're more successful and we're happier. You ready for a story? Let's do it. Love stories. Okay. So shortly after I joined Google, this was now a very long time ago, 2004, I had to give a presentation to the founders and the CEO about how the AdSense business was doing. And I walked into the room and there in one corner of the room was one of the founders on an elliptical trainer wearing toe shoes and a bright blue spandex unitard, super tight, not what I was expecting or frankly wanting to see in the room. And there in the other corner of the room was the CEO doing his emails like his brain had been plugged into the machine.

(00:09:49):
So probably like you in such a situation, I felt a little bit nervous. How was I supposed to get these people's attention? Luckily for me, the AdSense business was on fire. And when I said how many new customers we had added, the CEO almost fell off his chair. "What did you say? This is incredible. Do you need more engineers? Do you need more marketing dollars?" So I'm thinking the meeting's going all right. In fact, I now believe that I am a genius. And I walked out of the room, I walked past my boss and I was expecting a high five a pat on the back. And instead she said to me, "Why don't you walk back to my office with me?" And I thought, Oh gosh, I screwed something up in there and I'm sure I'm about to hear about it. And she began not by telling me what I had done wrong, but what had gone well in the meeting, not in the feedback sandwich.

(00:10:37):
I think there's a less polite term for that. I'm not sure how you feel about cussing on your podcast.

Lenny (00:10:37):
It's acceptable, fully acceptable.

Kim Scott (00:10:43):
Not in the shit sandwich since the word, but really seeming to mean what she said. But of course, all I wanted to do was hear about what I had done wrong. And eventually she said to me, "You said um a lot in there, were you aware of it?" And with this, I braved a huge sigh of relief if that was all I had done wrong who really cared. And I kind of made this brush off gesture with my hand. I said, "Yeah, I know, it's a verbal tech. It's no big deal, really." And then she said to me, "I know this great speech coach. I bet Google would pay for it. Would you like an introduction?" And once again, I made this brush off gesture with my hand.

(00:11:14):
I said, "Oh, I'm busy. I don't have time for a speech coach. Didn't you hear about all these new customers?" And then she said to me, "I can tell when you do that thing with your hand, then I'm going to have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid." Now she's got my full attention. And some people might say it was mean of her to say I sounded stupid, but in fact, it was the kindest thing that she could have done for me at that moment in my career because she knew me well enough to know that if she didn't use just those words with me, and by the way, this is a really important point, she never would've used those words with other people on her team who were perhaps a better listener than I was.

(00:11:56):
But she knew me well enough. She cared personally enough to know that if she didn't use those words with me, I never would've gone to visit the speech coach and I wouldn't have learned that she was not exaggerating. And this was news to me because I had raised millions of dollars for two different startups giving presentations. I thought I was pretty good at it. And it really got me to thinking sort of why had no one told me. It was almost like I suddenly realized I'd been marching through my whole career with a giant hunk of spinach in between my teeth and nobody had had the common courtesy to tell me it was there. So why had no one else told me. But what was it about her leadership style that made it so seemingly easy for her to tell me? And as I thought about that, I realized it really came down to those two things.

(00:12:41):
She cared personally and she challenged directly. She cared about me not just as an employee but as a human being. For example, when my father was diagnosed with late stage cancer, I was devastated and she could tell that I was devastated. And she said, "Kim, look, you go to the airport, fly home to Memphis, you need to be with your family. Your team and I will sit down and write your coverage plan." That's what great teams do for one another. And those were the kinds of things, that was the kind of thing that she did. She couldn't do, of course, for all 5,000 people in her organization, no matter how talented you are, relationships don't scale. But she did do those things for her direct reports and the people who she worked most closely with, all of us.

(00:13:27):
And when a leader treats their team, the people who they interact with on a day-to-day basis with that kind of real care, then it's much more likely that their direct reports in turn are going to treat their teams with real care. And that creates a culture of caring. And even though relationships don't scale, culture does scale. So that was part of it. But of course there's also this challenge directly part which is equally as important. And I learned very quickly beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I screwed up, she was going to tell me and she was going to keep telling me until it penetrated my sometimes thick skull.

Lenny (00:14:07):
I had a manager that was also very good at this. He was very good at just giving me very direct feedback, and I knew that he was only doing it because he cared about my future. To kind of follow this thread and get a little tactical, is there language or phrases or ways of communicating that you recommend people use to either challenge directly and avoid people getting defensive or make it clear you care deeply?

Kim Scott (00:14:31):
People always want me to give them a script. And the problem with the script is that if I write it, you're going to sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself. And then people won't really think you mean what you're saying. But I do think there are some important things to consider when having these conversations. I think you want to go into the conversation, and by the way, everything I'm about to say applies to praise as much as it does to criticism. And I want to pause for a moment. That story is helpful because that's the kind of thing that has happened to so many of us, that's not unique to me. However, praise is even more important than criticism in terms of radical candor. Radical candor is not all about the boss giving the employee criticism. It should always start with soliciting feedback and it should include more praise and criticism, but anyway, way without offering up shit sandwiches.

(00:15:31):
So anyway, I think that the important thing for these conversations, these sort of two-minute impromptu moments of management, is to go into the conversation being humble. To me, I call it candor and not truth because if I march into a room and I say, "Lenny, I'm going to tell you the truth." I'm kind of implying I've got a pipeline to God and you don't know anything. And that's not what this is all about. This is a dialogue, not a monologue. So to me, candor implies here's how I understand the situation. I'm also curious to know how you understand the conversation. So you want to go in being humble, you might be wrong, and that's totally fine. Omniscience is not a requirement for radical candor, thank heavens. So you want to be humble. You want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to remember in your own head and you want to make it explicit to the other person that you're telling them this to help them.

(00:16:25):
You're not trying to be dominant or kick them in the shins or anything like that. You're telling them this because you care about them. So you want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to have these conversations right away, almost immediately. I mean, there's exceptions to everything I'm saying. None of this is absolute. But usually if I'm telling myself and Lenny, you can tell me if you have the same problem, but if I tell myself, Oh, I'm going to wait for a better moment to tell this person this thing, what I'm really saying is I'm never going to say. So if the purpose of praise is to tell people what to do more of, and the purpose of criticism is to tell them what to do less of, why wait. So you want to do it immediately unless you are so upset that you're going to say it in a terrible way or the other person is so upset that they can't hear you. But usually that's not the case.

(00:17:16):
You also want, and in the before times I used to say have these conversations in person. Now I say have these conversations synchronously and I'm going to recommend phone over video. There's a lot of evidence coming out of University of Chicago and probably other places, but that's the article I've read that there's more noise than signal in facial expressions and body language, especially if somebody is just a little square on a computer screen. But it also may be true in real life, like the phone actually may be one of our best communication innovations of all time because when you're talking to someone on the phone, you're listening to the words that they are saying to you, and that is really what you want to do in this moment. So make sure that you're having these conversations synchronously, because what you want to do next is gauge how it's landing.

(00:18:15):
So I'll talk about that in a minute. And you can't gauge how something is landing if you're sending an email or a text, and Slack is just a feedback train wreck waiting to happen. I once coached someone who kept giving feedback over Slack and I finally just quit coaching him. I was like, "If you keep making this mistake, I can't be your coach." So don't do that. Take a moment to pick up the phone and call the person. Go back to those old AT&T commercials when I was a kid. Reach out and touch someone. You want to show you care.

(00:18:52):
So let's review. You want to be humble, you want to be helpful, you want to do it immediately. You want to do it in person or at least synchronously. If you can't do it in person. You also want to praise in public and criticize in private, and you don't want to give people either praise or criticism about their personality. So if you want to remember all that, it's HHIIPPP, two H's, two I's, kind of three P's depending on how you count.

(00:19:21):
And so let's double-click though on this not about personality point. I think it's really important to remember that for both praise and criticism, you want to use sort of context, observation, result, next step. So context, in the meeting, observation, when you said um every third word, result, it made you sound stupid. Next step, go to the speech coach. Also is important for praise, in the meeting context, when you offered both sides of the argument, observation, result is it earned you credibility. Next step is do more of that. So you can call it CORE, you can think about that as CORE. I used to call it CORN, but I got some feedback that corn is like some shorthand for porn on TikTok. So I call it CORE instead, HIP CORE.

Lenny (00:20:16):
Wow, that is amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. So the E at the end stands for?

Kim Scott (00:20:20):
Next step, big E.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Oh, I see the E is the next, you skipped the N, clever.

Kim Scott (00:20:26):
Yes. I don't know, clever or ridiculous. Maybe I should just call it HIP CORN,

Lenny (00:20:31):
Right? No, I think either one's great. So you share this example of the speaking example. Maybe if we can do another example just to reinforce this framework.

Kim Scott (00:20:43):
Let's do a little ruinous empathy.

Lenny (00:20:47):
Okay, great. Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:20:47):
How about that? That is the mistake. I think that I am really focused in the book Radical Candor and also in my next book Radical Respect. That's the mistake I really want to eliminate.

Lenny (00:21:00):
Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:21:00):
Because ruinous empathy creates this false harmony, which is really bad. So here's my ruinous empathy story. I had just hired this guy, we'll call him Bob, and I liked Bob a lot. He was smart, he was charming, he was funny. He would do stuff like we're at a manager offsite playing one of those endless get to know you games. And everybody was getting more and more and more stressed out. So start up, we've got a lot going on. And Bob was the guy who had the courage to raise his hand and to say, "I can tell everyone is getting stressed. I want to get to know all of you. I've got an idea. It'll help us do that and it'll be really fast."

(00:21:41):
Whatever his idea was, if it was really fast, we were down with it. And Bob says, "Let's just go around the table and confess what candy our parents used when potty training us." Really weird but really fast. And then for the next 10 months, every time there was a tense moment in a meeting, Bob would whip out just the right piece of candy for the right person at the right moment. And we all remember that was the weirder thing. Like Hershey Kisses right here. That was what my parents used to potty train me.

(00:22:16):
And so Bob was quirky, but he brought a little levity to the office. Everybody kind of loved working with Bob. There was one problem with Bob. He was doing terrible work. He would hand stuff into me and there was shame in his eyes. He kind of knew it wasn't good enough. He was very creative, but riddled with sloppy mistakes. And I would say something to Bob along the lines of, "Oh Bob, this is such a great start. You're so awesome. We all love working with you. Maybe you can make it just a little bit better." So let's pause for a moment. Why did I say such a banal thing to Bob? I think part of the problem was that I liked Bob and I really didn't want to hurt his feelings.

(00:23:05):
So that was the ruinous empathy part of why I said that. But also part of the problem was something more insidious, a little bit of manipulative insincerity, because Bob was popular and Bob was also sensitive kind of. And there was part of me that was afraid if I told Bob in no uncertain terms that his work wasn't nearly good enough, he would get upset. He might even start to cry and then everybody would think I was a big, you know what? So the part of me that was worried about my reputation as a leader, that was the manipulative insincerity part, the part of me that was worried about Bob's feelings, that was the ruinous empathy part. And this went on for 10 months, 10 long months, and I was so puzzled the whole time I couldn't understand what was going on. I learned much later that one of the issues perhaps was that Bob was smoking pot in the bathroom three times a day, which maybe explained all that candy that he had at all times.

(00:24:11):
But I didn't know any of that at the time. All I knew is that Bob was consistently doing bad work, but I wasn't really dealing with it. And eventually the inevitable happened. I realized that if I didn't fire Bob, I was going to lose all my best performers because not only had it been unfair to Bob not to tell him, I also had been unfair to everyone on the team. And they were frustrated. Their deliverables were late because his deliverables were late. They weren't able to do their best work because they were having to spend so much time redoing his work.

(00:24:46):
And the people who were best at their jobs were going to quit because they wanted to be able to do their best work. They were going to go to a different company where they could do their best work. And so I sat down to have a conversation with Bob that I should have begun frankly 10 months previously. And when I finished explaining to him where things stood, he kind of pushed his chair back from the table. He looked me right in the eye and he said, "Why didn't you tell me?" And as that question was going around in my head with no good answer, he looked at me again and he said, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me." And now I realized that by not telling Bob, thinking I was being so nice, I'm having to fire him as a result. Not so nice after all. But it was too late to say Bob because at this point even he agreed he should go because his reputation on the team was just shot.

(00:25:46):
All I could do in the moment was make myself a very solemn promise that I would never make that mistake again, and that I would do everything in my power to help other people avoid making that mistake. It was so painful. It was painful for me. It was painful for Bob, much more painful for Bob actually, and it was bad for the whole team and it was bad for our investors. We weren't getting results because of my ruinous empathy and ruinous empathy slash manipulative insincerity. It's much harder to admit the manipulative insincerity part. And that is really why I'm here talking to you because I want all of your listeners to avoid making that mistake because it's the most painful and the most common mistake that I think leaders and not just leaders, I mean all of us make this mistake in all of our relationships.

Lenny (00:26:41):
I love that this also gives an example of the impact of getting better at this point of you'll lose not just the people that are not necessarily great, but also other high performers on the team because they're seeing people slip through the cracks that aren't amazing. And if you're not practicing this early, your team basically becomes not high performing.

Kim Scott (00:27:00):
Yeah, exactly. You're going to lose your top performers. And I think very often people are afraid to tell someone on their team when their work isn't good enough because they're afraid of losing them. But that's not a good reason. You should be helping this person to improve. This person deserves to have a job where they can excel and you either help them excel on this team or you help them find a different job where they can excel, because everyone can do great work somewhere. And Bob could have done great work. Maybe I would've helped him keep it to the weekends because he's very creative and very smart, but the floppy mistakes just got in the way of his ability to do his best work.

Lenny (00:27:50):
So following that thread, I imagine the reason you didn't tell him early, and most people don't do this well, is many people are, you can maybe call them people pleasers. I'm a recovering people pleaser, I'll say. It's just hard to give people hard feedback. You want people to like you. It's not a natural state for a lot of people. What do you find helps people get over this kind of need to be liked as a leader and helps them be more candid?

Kim Scott (00:28:15):
I think that one of the things that was helpful for me anyway, so you can tell me if it's helpful for you, was realizing that my job was not to be liked. My job was to care about other people and to get out of my own head and to become others focused is what helped me kind of let go of the need to be liked. I think that also as a woman, I think there was something extra, as my teenage children would say, there was something extra for me because the sort of likability- competence bias that a lot of women face pushed me, especially early in my career, in the wrong direction on challenge directly.

(00:29:04):
And it made it much harder for me to, because often I would say something and I would say it even more gently than my colleagues who were men, but people would say, "Ah, Kim is a real whatever." And they weren't saying, Kim is obnoxious. I was being unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression and it wasn't obnoxious or they were accusing me of being bossy or or abrasive or whatever. And it's really hard. I would also say when it comes to eliciting feedback, it's really important to be open to it and it's really important to separate the wheat from the chaff from the feedback you're getting.

Lenny (00:29:41):
So in this example of Bob, say you were to do it now, what would you do differently other than give him feedback earlier? Is there something you've learned about just how you would've phrased it or approached it?

Kim Scott (00:29:58):
I think probably what I would do, and I would love to hear what you would've said to Bob too, I certainly don't have all the answers, but probably what I would've said is let's go back to the first time Bob handed work into me with shame in his eyes. I would've said, "Bob, maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression on your face, but it looks to me like you are not happy with this. What's going on?" And so I would've asked him to diagnose it himself and I want to pause on that because that can be very risky. He might have said to me, "I think this is awesome. This is my best work," and now I've kind of made my job of giving him feedback a little bit harder. So it's not always the right thing to ask questions, but I would've tried to ask it before I had examined the work when I noticed that he looked uncomfortable himself.

(00:30:47):
And I think also another thing I've learned about noticing, I said earlier that there's a lot of evidence that we often misinterpret each other's facial expressions and body language. So I would've tried to say that with some humility, it seems like you're not, maybe I'm wrong, but you don't look to me like you're happy with this. And I would've given him an opportunity to say, "Yeah, maybe I need to do it again." Let's imagine though that he said, "Oh no, it's awesome. It's ready." So then I get it and I look at it. I would have not been shy about pointing out very specifically every problem that I saw in that piece of work, every single one. Sometimes it can be tempting when you're giving someone feedback to say, "Oh, there's a number of careless mistakes here. Can you go back and look at it again," and the person will notice a few of them and then you got to go, sometimes it's useful to show someone a pattern.

(00:31:53):
All of the careless mistakes, especially if someone is defensive or if you think they're likely to be defensive, if you think they're likely to do to you what I did to my boss, oh no, everything's fine. It's no big deal. You need to move out on the challenge directly dimension. You need to be prepared to keep going until you have communicated with a person. And that was really the problem with Bob. He probably would not have started to cry. I think my fear around his tears was probably more about my fear than what was actually likely to happen. But I think we do fear someone else getting upset more often than they actually get upset. We have kind of a negativity bias when it comes to part of the reason why we're reluctant to give feedback.

Lenny (00:32:42):
And I think to your point, that we want to be liked, like you said, that you should get over that. I think that's obviously very hard just to be like, "Nah, I'm not going to worry about that." But I think your point is really important that you'll be liked later if you don't do the hard thing now. It'll only get worse if you just let it continue happening.

Kim Scott (00:33:01):
And I think also for me to say to myself going into that conversation, it's more important for me to demonstrate care, that I care about Bob than it is for Bob to like me, and if I demonstrate that I care about Bob, then I'm going to do the right thing that will ultimately create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob. Me pulling my punches did not create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob.

Lenny (00:33:31):
I actually did that and I learned this from a manager of mine is just almost work backwards from ask them, what do you want to achieve in your career? Where do you want to go in this company and make sure they know you know what they want, and then basically work backwards from to get there. Here's the things you need to get, and here's the thing you did recently that isn't necessarily on the track and here's what we should be working on if you want to get to the skull that you have.

Kim Scott (00:33:57):
Yeah, I think one of the really important things that all managers can do for their direct reports to show that they care is to have real meaningful career conversations, where you talk about their life story, sort of their past, whatever part of it they're comfortable talking to you about so that you understand what motivates them at work. And I would have three separate 45 minute conversations, so one about their past, one about their future, their dreams for the future, and it's not just the next couple of years. It's like imagine at the height of your career you have everything you want. What does it look like? And give me three or four different pictures of that because very few of us know what we want to do when we grow up.

(00:34:40):
Then the third conversation is to sort of sit down with your director report and come up with a career action plan. So given what motivates you and where you want to go, what are the skills that it would be useful for you to develop so that you can get where you want to go and who can I introduce you to? What are the educational opportunities? Can we tweak your job so that you're gaining those skills so you're at least taking a step in the direction of your dreams, even if you're not there yet?

Lenny (00:35:11):
Awesome. I have a post about this. I'll link to in the show notes that gives people a guide to having these conversations, and there's a spreadsheet I share with people like, here's an action plan you can come up with your teammate and here's what you're going to work on these next six months.

Kim Scott (00:35:24):
Did you read the book When they Win, You Win by Russ Laraway?

Lenny (00:35:24):
No.

Kim Scott (00:35:29):
Oh, he has a hundred pages on career conversations and he's also built sort of some tools that help people. So check that out.

Lenny (00:35:39):
And it's called When You Win... When They Win, You Win.

Kim Scott (00:35:41):
When They Win, You Win.

Lenny (00:35:42):
Amazing.

Kim Scott (00:35:42):
Yes, by Russ Laraway, he and I worked together at Google and then we started a company together.

Lenny (00:35:48):
Oh wow. Okay, cool. We'll link to them in the show notes. Maybe I'll get him on the podcast too. Great.

Kim Scott (00:35:51):
Yeah, he'd be great.

Lenny (00:35:53):
Okay, so we've been chatting about ways individually to get better at some of these skills. Another area that I think people struggle with is the company culture often isn't welcoming of direct feedback. So there's a question, so you probably saw this on Twitter. I asked people, what should I ask you? And a lot of people came in with a lot of questions and there's one that came in from Pete, so I'm just going to read it along these lines. So this question is just how do you practice being radically candid in a culture? And most cultures are like this where people aren't ready for direct feedback. Since company culture is often closer to ruinous empathy and being radically candid is more of a long-term good than a short-term good. You could potentially risk retention with your employees if you're too direct with them. So how do you think about finding this balance of being candid but not pissing people off, or do you just hire people that are open and ready for direct feedback and that's kind of how you solve that problem?

Kim Scott (00:36:45):
I don't think you can only hire people who are open and ready for direct feedback because it's hard for all of us. I just want to acknowledge that, it's hard for me. I mean, I wrote the book, I believe in it to my core and sometimes it's still hard for me. It's hard for me to hear it and it's hard for me to deliver it. This is a really difficult thing to do. The good thing about that two by two is it makes it look easy, which is useful, but it's not easy. So anyway, I think there are, to answer Pete's question, I think there are a few things that can help. There's really an order of operations to radical candor, and if you begin with soliciting criticism, then you take the first and most important step to improving your relationship with that person enough that it becomes easier for you to give it as well as to get it.

(00:37:35):
So I want to leave folks with some sort of steps on how to solicit feedback, and this is true, especially if you're a boss, but it's true in all your relationships. You can use this at home as well. So if you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." Nobody in your life accepts your teenage children. If you have teenage children, they'd really want to give you some criticism, but nobody else in your life really wants to give you criticism. And so you want to think about how you're going to ask the person that's going to be most likely to elicit a response. The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" But do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you.

(00:38:33):
I was working with Christa Quarles when she was CEO of OpenTable and she said, "Kim, I could never imagine those words coming out of my mouth." She said, "The way I like to ask is tell me why I'm wrong." Okay, that's fine too. It demands an answer to her question. But of course there were a couple of people on her team who felt that that was too aggressive, that shut them down, so she had to adjust her question. Being authentic does not mean ignoring the impact you're having on others. So you want to think about your question, you want to think about who you're going to ask that question of, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:39:22):
Let's spend more time on this actually. So what is it you recommend, that they pick? How many people would you recommend they pick, and ask feedback from?

Kim Scott (00:39:28):
Well, I think if you are a manager, you need to be soliciting every week feedback from each of your direct reports, and you need to sort of, I would budget five minutes at the end of your one-on-one to solicit feedback. So mostly a one-on-one should be your employees setting the agenda and your employee's time and don't by the way, save up when you have to give feedback. Don't save it up for your one-on-one and definitely don't save it up for a performance review. You want to give that in the moment. We can talk more about that in a second, but when you're soliciting feedback, save five minutes at the end of your one-on-one and ask that go-to question. And you also want to ask that go-to question of your cross-functional peers who you work most closely with and of your boss. And I think you don't want to ask the same question every single time. It'll start to sound like you don't really want the answer, but you want to make this part of your daily weekly routine with the people who you interact most closely with.

Lenny (00:40:34):
So you added to the end of this your one-on-one agenda, and two versions of this question are, what am I doing wrong? Which is that one I guess you iterated.

Kim Scott (00:40:43):
Tell me why I'm wrong or what am I doing wrong or what could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me? Or what should I stop doing? What should I start doing? What should I continue doing? Those are some common ones. What do you like to ask Lenny?

Lenny (00:41:00):
I think it was something along the lines of like, what's one thing I could be doing better or what's one way I could be helping you be more successful?

Kim Scott (00:41:07):
That's a really good one. What's one way I could help you be more successful? Or Jason Rosoff, my co founder at Radical Candor likes to ask, "What could I have done this week?" So he time, he time bounds it. "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" In fact, Jason told me after we had worked together for about a month, he was like, "Kim, I really hate your go-to question." He said, "It's too open-ended for me. If you can tell me what you're working on and ask me at the end of a meeting specifically what I noticed then that is much better."

Lenny (00:41:48):
How often do you accept no answer? Just like, no everything's great.

Kim Scott (00:41:52):
Never,

Lenny (00:41:53):
Never,

Kim Scott (00:41:53):
Never. I mean, there are some people who really don't like to be put on the spot. So if I can tell that I'm inflicting a cruel and unusual punishment on the person, I'll say, "Look, you know I'm not perfect. I know I'm not perfect. Next time we meet, I want you to think of something, notice something. It's the thing that you can do that would help me more than anything else that you could do is to tell me when I'm wrong because I need to know that." In fact, Andy Grove, who was the CEO of Intel said he used to at the end of his one-on-ones say to people, "There's one more thing. And he explained to me that that was coded Intel for like this is the most important thing." I was working at Apple at the time and I said, "Oh, did you get that from Steve Jobs?"

(00:42:47):
That was always how he introduced, "Just one more thing, the iPad." And Andy got immediately very grumpy and very offended, and he said, "No, we both got it from Colombo. The detective show." You can get tips from anywhere. So you want to make sure that you're though letting the person know that you really do care about what they say and that it's really when they give you this critical feedback that you're going to reward it. But that's not the end. Asking that question is only the first step, the bad news about your question, no matter how hard you think about it, and no matter how good a question it is, the other person is still going to feel uncomfortable. There's no such thing as emotional Novocaine. That's why I don't believe in scripts. People believe if I just say the magic words like the door will open, that's not how it works. It's a give and take. So you want to sort of be prepared to embrace that discomfort. The only way out is through. Simplest way to embrace the discomfort is to close your mouth and count to six.

(00:43:59):
Only made it to three just there, and your eyes were popping out.

Lenny (00:44:03):
That is so long.

Kim Scott (00:44:04):
Six seconds is a really long time. Almost nobody can endure six full seconds of silence. So they'll probably tell you something. So now you've dragged this poor soul out on a conversational limb that they never wanted to go on. They're probably going to say something. The third step is to make sure that you listen with the intent to understand not to respond, because you're probably going to feel defensive and that's okay. It doesn't mean you're a lesser mortal or that you're shut down the feedback. All it means is that you're human. And that's all part of this. You want to figure out how to manage your natural defensive reaction to critical feedback, which you're probably going to have. The simplest tactic I can offer folks there is to think of some follow-up questions.

(00:44:56):
So at breakfast, my daughter not too long ago said to me, "Mom, I wish you weren't the Radical Candor lady." And immediately this wave of parental guilt washed over me and I thought, ah, I'm spending too much time at work. She wants more of my time. I shouldn't be traveling so much. But then I thought, well, I should ask her, make sure I understood. I'm jumping to conclusions here. I'm not listening with the intent to understand. So I asked a follow-up question. I said, "Well, who do you wish I were?" And she said, "I wish you were the lady who minded her own business," so I could go spend a little more time at work as far as she was concerned. So you want to make sure you really understand what a person is telling you. And once you feel certain that you really do understand and that you've been open to it, the last and most important step is to reward the candor.

(00:45:46):
A person takes a huge risk, especially if this person is your employee. A person takes a huge risk to give you critical feedback. And if you do not reward that risk richly, you're never going to get any feedback again. So if you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your listening tangible, be loud. So-and-so told me that the tea in the break room is terrible, and now we have thirty-five different kinds of tea. Thank you for telling me. And that can demonstrate to people that they're not wasting their breath to come to you. That if you become aware of a problem, you'll fix it. And you also want to, by the way, you want to ask for feedback after you fixed it. Did I over-correct or did I under-correct?

(00:46:31):
My boss at Google, the same boss from the um story also told me when she gave me some feedback that I tended to move too fast. And she said, "Kim, until people and giving you feedback that you're going too slow. You won't have corrected this problem." So you kind of want to shoot to over-correct if you get some critical feedback. I also want to though pause on what to do when you get some critical feedback that you disagree with because it can be easy to feel wedged here. And if all you do is say thank you for the feedback, the other person is going to hear something much less polite than a brush off or worse.

(00:47:10):
And so what you want to do is you want to look for that five or 10% of whatever the person said that you can agree with, and you want to give voice to that. And then what you want to do is you want to say, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you." And then you've got to get back to them. You got to offer a respectful explanation of why you disagree. And it's tempting to feel like a disagreement poses a risk to our relationships, but it's not disagreement that poses a risk to our relationships. It's unspoken disagreement. Many, I don't know about you Lenny, but a lot of my best professional relationships began with a good respectful disagreement.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Interesting. That reminds me of just watching Squid Games, the reality show on Netflix. Yeah. Have you seen this at all?

Kim Scott (00:47:56):
I haven't watched it, but it's on my list.

Lenny (00:47:59):
There's this guy who makes a huge bad decision on behalf of his whole team and they hate him in the show. And then on TikTok, he shared that they're best friends now, even though they called him a big idiot.

Kim Scott (00:48:09):
Yeah, no.

Lenny (00:48:09):
So funny.

Kim Scott (00:48:10):
It can happen for sure.

Lenny (00:48:12):

(00:49:32):
So to recap the steps roughly for how to get feedback from people, it's ask your question like what's one thing I could have done this week to make you more successful? Wait six seconds potentially or try to, it's very hard. Ask a few follow-up questions to make sure you understand what they're saying and then find a way to reward them. Say thank you.

Kim Scott (00:49:53):
Do more than say thank you.

Lenny (00:49:55):
Especially if you disagree, which is a really interesting nuance of this. I had Jules Walter on the podcast. I always think of him when I think of getting feedback. He shared this advice. When you get feedback, just be so appreciative so that people keep giving me just like, "Thank you so much for that feedback." The way he phrases it. Even if you're melting inside and really hate this feedback, just like, "thank you, I really appreciate it." But I think your nuance there is really key is if you do disagree, I really like this tip of just like, let me think about this element of it and then actually follow up.

Kim Scott (00:50:25):
Even if you're melting inside, if you say thank you and you're melting inside, I mean maybe it's a terrible actor, but usually people know. And that's why I say it's not enough to say thank you. You got to fix the problem and then show what you did to fix the problem and get more feedback. Did I over-correct? Did I under-correct. And if you disagree, you got to say that you disagree, but you got to say, so respectfully.

Lenny (00:50:48):
As a leader, this sounds like a lot of work to be doing every week. If you have a one-on-one following up correcting things. Is there anything you'd recommend there? Or is it just, this is really important, you got to make time.

Kim Scott (00:50:58):
It's not as much work as failing to do this as we saw from the Bob story. So I think that the important thing that I have found is that this is part of why it's so important to do it immediately. It's important for the other person, but it's also important for you. If you're doing this in a one-on-one, which you should be having anyway. So you're saving some time in a one-on-one. So it's not adding time necessarily to your day. And when you hear about problems, you should fix them. Yes, it takes time, but that is your job. And when you disagree with something, you can disagree in your next regularly scheduled one-on-one. So I'm not talking about adding meetings to your calendar, so it doesn't actually take more time. I have found that in fact, it saves tremendous amounts of time, but it does take emotional discipline.

(00:51:52):
And I think it also requires you, especially when it comes to giving it, which we talked about before, where the humble, helpful, those are impromptu two-minute conversations, giving the feedback that you should be having in between your meetings. In the um story, walk to my meeting with me, it didn't take any extra time for my boss to give me that feedback. She had to walk to her meeting anyway, and I had to go in the same direction. So it didn't even take extra time from me. But it is, I think one of the most common reasons why people don't do this in addition to fear of retaliation and just sort of existential dread, which are both factors, which hopefully we've helped alleviate, but is that you're scheduled back to back to back and you don't have those two minutes in between meetings.

(00:52:42):
And that's why I think it's important either to schedule slack time in your calendar, make your 30 minute meetings, 25 minute meetings, make your hour-long meetings, 50 minute meetings, maybe give yourself a few breaks in the day. But if it's not possible, and often it was not possible for me in my career to sort of schedule my time that way, I just decided that these moments of management were more important than being on time to my next meeting. And so I was just late sometimes. So I wish I had a better answer than either control your time, which is really annoying advice because it's impossible to follow or be willing to be late to your next meeting. But those were the things that I tried to do.

Lenny (00:53:34):
That was super helpful. I think your point of just, if you're not making two minutes to do this thing now, it'll be a lot more time intensive later.

Kim Scott (00:53:40):
Oh yeah. It's stitch in time takes nine on all these two minute, and really it should be brushing and flossing. This is not like a root canal. These are like, this is relationship hygiene that you should be doing all the time.

Lenny (00:53:55):
I was just reading Charlie Munger's book and there's a quote that he references of just the classic, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Kim Scott (00:54:03):
Yes, absolutely.

Lenny (00:54:04):
Same idea. So we've talked about a leader getting feedback. What if you're the employee? Do you also recommend the same thing in the one-on-one, have an agenda item and ask this question? Or is there a different approach you'd recommend?

Kim Scott (00:54:16):
I think yes, if you're the employee, you should also be soliciting feedback on a regular basis from your boss. So there's sort of an order of operations you want to solicit at first, no matter who you are, it's the same up, down, and sideways, even though it feels very different, the order of operations is the same. So start by soliciting feedback. Then you want to give both praise and criticism. I think sometimes it feels like you're kissing up if you give your boss praise, but bosses need praise too. And if there are things that your boss does that you appreciate and you want your boss to do more of those things, praise is a better tool for that than criticism. When it comes time to offering your boss some critical feedback, you want to make sure, and by the way, this is also true when it comes time to give your employee critical feedback or your spouse or anybody else in your life, you want to be sure that you are prepared to gauge how it lands.

(00:55:09):
So you want to start in kind of a neutral place. You don't want to go to the outer edge of challenge directly because then you're going to wind up in obnoxious aggression. So if we go back to that story, my boss started, "You said um a lot, were you aware of it?" "Nah." That was my response. And then "I know this great speech coach, would you like an introduction?" "Nah," was my response. So she had to keep going out on that challenge directly. She didn't start out by saying, "When you say um I'm every third word, it makes you sound stupid." But she realized she had to go that far. So you want to keep going out if you think they're brushing you off. But if you find that your boss looks either sad or mad, that is your cue to move up on the care personally dimension.

(00:55:51):
And so to take a moment, and if you find your employee looks sad or mad, if they look sad, pause and say, "I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?" And so that means you're going up on the care personally, dimension, but you're not going the wrong way on challenge directly. I don't know about you Lenny, but if I say something to someone and they look sad, it's so tempting for me to try to pull the words back. "Oh no, it's no big deal. I didn't mean it," but it is a big deal, and I did mean it, that's why I just said it. And so if you go the wrong way on challenge directly, you wind up in ruinous empathy, and then you leave the person both sad and confused, so you make it worse.

(00:56:34):
So you want to take a beat to pay attention to the emotions in the moment, but not to go the wrong way on challenge directly. Same thing if they're mad, although if somebody's mad, that maybe is even harder. If somebody starts yelling at me, it's tempting for me either to start yelling back and wind up in obnoxious aggression or to crawl off to a self-protective, manipulative insincerity. And so instead, what I try to do is get curious, not furious, and why is this person so mad? So say like, Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue and we need to resolve it.

Lenny (00:57:14):
This comes back to the point you made about when you're giving feedback to try to do it in person or on a phone call to do exactly what you're saying, to read them as you're giving this feedback and figure out which axis you want to go down.

Kim Scott (00:57:25):
Yeah, you want to gauge it. I mean, when we communicate with other people, we communicate on an emotional level and on an intellectual level at the same time. And if we ignore the emotional signals that are coming at us or say don't take it personally, then we're just not going to communicate very well.

Lenny (00:57:43):
Along these same lines, another question that came in is from a coach of yours that works I think for you or somehow with the program. She asked this question of many top leaders have very low self-awareness. They believe obnoxious aggression is the only way to give feedback, or they just ignore the problem and fire people with no feedback. Is there something you've learned about how to change their mind about this is the way to operate?

Kim Scott (00:58:05):
Yeah, I think the most important thing with leaders like that, that you can do is to explain to them the impact that they're having and to also show them that there is another way that is going to help them succeed. Very often the leaders who are low on the care personally dimension, they do care about their results and they do care about their own careers. And so when you sort of explain this to them in terms of enlightened self-interest, they tend to get better at it. And also, I mean there I can think of maybe one or two people I've worked with who are truly low on care, who truly don't care. Very often people are bad at showing they care, but they do actually care. And also sometimes there are leaders who think they're not supposed to care. And so unleashing that capacity that they innately have to care and telling them this is actually part of the job can make them a much better, more effective leader. But look, if someone is a psychopath and they truly don't care, they shouldn't be a manager. That's the solution.

Lenny (00:59:27):
I totally get that one. So I really like that takeaway. Just basically show them the impact they're having because to your point, they want the company to succeed. They want their team to succeed. And if they're not realizing there's downsides to the way they're operating.

Kim Scott (00:59:38):
And they want themselves to succeed. That's why I say part of the problem with obnoxious aggression is that you harm other people, but it's also inefficient because when you act like that, people can't hear what you're saying, so you're wasting your breath.

Lenny (00:59:56):
And the way you show them that impact. Do you recommend interviewing people, getting stories, seeing, I don't know, how do you collect this impact so that they're like, oh, wow, I didn't realize this.

Kim Scott (01:00:07):
I think that the best thing to do is, for me anyway, is I start by sharing stories from my career and stories when I was a jerk. I've acted like a jerk too, plenty of times, unfortunately. And I show the impact that I've had and then I ask them for a similar story. And usually sort of me holding up the mirror to myself is useful for them to be able to hold the mirror up to themselves to realize you want to help these people adopt a growth mindset around this stuff. I am not telling you that you're an asshole. I'm telling you that we all behave like assholes sometimes. And it's a big problem for us as well as for the people around us. And here's my story, when I acted like a jerk, what's yours? And people, that kind of self-awareness, sometimes people talk about inflicted insight like it's some kind of burden, but usually that kind of self-awareness makes people feel lighter. They're like, "Ah, now I know what's wrong and now I know what I can do about it."

Lenny (01:01:14):
Yeah, I've definitely noticed that about your stories. They always are you making the mistake, which I think is very disarming.

Kim Scott (01:01:20):
We all make mistakes.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Yeah. Maybe the extreme of this obnoxious aggressiveness is Bridgewater. Their whole approach is like theirs.

Kim Scott (01:01:31):
Oh my gosh. Did you read the book The Fund?

Lenny (01:01:34):
No, not yet.

Kim Scott (01:01:35):
You must read it. It's all about Bridgewater. I always thought it was problematic. I had no idea just how problematic it is. Put that book in the show notes one of the best business books I've read in the last decade.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Wow, that is high praise. Yes, I will read that. And so I guess for people that aren't familiar, like Bridgewater, they encourage, they have a system called Dots where they tell people, you must give hard critical feedback after every meeting, publicly.

Kim Scott (01:02:01):
Not after the meeting, in the meeting, publicly. And it's recorded on, it was, I think they changed it since, but it was recorded for posterity on video. And sometimes, in fact, true story, shortly after I left Google, I was approached to work at Bridgewater in a management capacity, not in an investment capacity. And so I called someone I knew who worked there and he said, "Let me give you an anecdote." He said, "The other day there was a meeting and there was a woman who in the meeting who had made a mistake and everybody just piled on. The criticism was very personal. There was no core about the criticism. It was like, these are your personality attributes that make you a useless human being. Kind of terrible feedback until she started to cry and the whole meeting was recorded and then they emailed a recording of the meeting out to the whole company, including all the people who were not in the meeting saying, this is an example of how to have..." So I would say that is deep, dark, obnoxious aggression. That is not radical candor. That is horrible.

Lenny (01:03:24):
So it's safe to say you're not a fan of that approach?

Kim Scott (01:03:26):
No. In fact, I did an analysis of Dalio's book Principles and it's like a, I don't know, 3 or 400 page book. And there were I think four or five pages about caring about people. There's very low care personally.

Lenny (01:03:44):
I imagine many people see that, they see Elon, they see Steve Jobs, and the perception is they're very challenge directly people, they're not clearly care about you people, but they're very successful. What do you say to people that are like, but it works. Why wouldn't I be that if that's the way I want to do it?

Kim Scott (01:04:00):
Well, first of all, I would not put Steve Jobs in the same category as Ray Dalio and Elon Musk. I mean, Steve Jobs could be obnoxiously aggressive, but mostly I would say he built such good relationships with his direct reports that when he got cancer, Tim Cook offered to give him half his liver. And I don't know of a word to describe that other than love. These were real human relationships. When I worked at Apple, you could see Steve and Johnny talking. You could tell these people cared about each other. Now, radical candor gets measured not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear. And I think that Steve had built a team around him of people who didn't mind rather what other people would consider obnoxious aggression. But I think in the context of their relationship, it was understood as care.

(01:05:03):
I'll give you an example of that from my own career, not that I am comparing myself to Steve Jobs, I think I'm a much gentler person, but sometimes I develop relationships with people. And part of that relationship is that we push each other pretty hard. So there was a person who I had worked with for a long time, for many years. He had followed me from one company to another, and we were localizing a product and he kept conflating Slovakia and Slovenia, and I corrected him once. I corrected him twice the third time, I was like, did Slovakia, not Slovenia dumb ass.

(01:05:44):
And he started laughing, and that was fine in the context of our relationship, but I realized that the people around me, I was silencing them. They were like, "Oh my gosh, I don't want to make a mistake. Kim's going to call me a dumb ass." So I had to pause and say, "Look, I respect this person enormously, and I like this person enormously. We work very well together." And so I think that sometimes people have relationships with others and they have those relationships in public and other people misinterpret those relationships.

(01:06:19):
Steve Jobs was not perfect. He made all kinds of mistakes, but he was no Ray Dalio or Elon Musk, who I would say make far more and worse and more egregious mistakes. And I think you're raising a really important point. You're raising a point, which is that there's this false dichotomy. In fact, the new biography of Elon Musk falls into this category. I like Walter Isaacson's work a lot, but he falls prey to this in his biography of Elon Musk, which is there's this notion that we have to choose between being a total jerk but really competent or really nice but incompetent. And those are not our two choices. That's the whole point of radical candor is that there's this other way that works better and doesn't hurt people.

Lenny (01:07:13):
I think that's the key takeaway there is you can be even more successful if you lean into the care deeply. In theory, they could have gotten more out of their people if they made it clear they really care about them.

Kim Scott (01:07:26):
And there's plenty of counter examples of incredibly successful people who are very caring leaders, and it's not as much fun to tell stories about that. And so we don't as often.

Lenny (01:07:40):
Along the same lines, there's someone that you worked with that suggested I ask you about investing in your authentic leadership style, Melissa Tan. I don't know if you remember her.

Kim Scott (01:07:50):
Yes.

Lenny (01:07:51):
Okay, great. And she was on the podcast in the past, and she just said how when she met you, she was a very people-pleasery person and just wanted to be like, and you helped her develop her natural leadership style. Can you just talk about what you suggest to people to figure this out and how to find that for yourself?

Kim Scott (01:08:06):
I mean, I wonder what Melissa would say, but my memory of conversations with her, and this is an issue that I talk about a lot because a people pleaser too. I grew up in the South and I'm a woman. I was not brought up to challenge directly. That was not part of the culture that I was brought up in. I was brought up to be polite but also brought up to be kind. And for me, the thing that is most important to hang on to is that fundamental kindness and to realize that it's actually unkind not to say the thing. And so that is part of the reason why I encourage people. I tell the Bob story so often and I encourage other leaders who I work with to think about what their Bob story is that you realize it's not nice in the long run.

(01:09:00):
It's unkind in the long run, not to tell someone if they're making a mistake. There's nothing nice about that in the long run. And so that I think at least for me, that's been helpful. And then another thing that is helpful is again, to get others focused, to focus not on pleasing people, but on doing the right thing for those people, on truly caring about those people more than you care about your own discomfort in the moment. And that is something that is easier for people to do than just to challenge directly. I think in many ways it's about what is getting in the way. That's why I call it ruinism. Empathy is a good thing, but sometimes empathy can paralyze at least me because I'm so acutely aware of how what I'm going to say might impact the other person, might hurt their feelings that I don't say it.

(01:10:01):
And so when I push myself to be, and you can call it compassionate candor if you like that better than radical candor. But when I push myself not to feel so acutely what I think the other person might feel, and by the way, I could be wrong about what I think the other person might often, they're like, it's no big deal. They're like, oh, thank you for letting me know. But when I can let go of that and think about the other person and what I care about and what they care about for their future, going back to your point, if you know that it's really important for someone to get promoted and they won't get promoted if they keep talking to people in a particular way, then you're focused on what they want. That is really helpful to move past that.

Lenny (01:10:47):
Just a few more questions before we wrap up. Your book sold something like half a million copies.

Kim Scott (01:10:47):
A million now.

Lenny (01:11:00):
A million copies.

Kim Scott (01:11:00):
Million copies. Million in 23 languages. Yes.

Lenny (01:11:00):
23 languages. I had a stat of 20 languages. Jesus Christ. So a lot of people have read it, a lot of people have been using it. What's something that people often just get wrong that super frustrates you about the system, the recommendations that you just wish people come on, here's what I really wanted to say, or here's what you should change.

Kim Scott (01:11:17):
There's two things. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, when you write about a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it. One is this, in the spirit of Radical Candor and then the person acts like a jerk. That is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That is the spirit of obnoxious aggression. But shortly after the book came out, I was giving a talk at a tech company in San Francisco and I got some feedback from the CEO of that company that was so impactful that it caused me to write my next book, which is called Radical Respect. And in many ways, Radical Respect is kind of the prequel to Radical Candor because if you don't respect the other person, it's impossible to care about them and you're not going to bother challenging them directly. So what happened in this meeting? I walked in, I was really excited to give this talk.

(01:12:04):
The CEO had been a colleague of mine for the better part of a decade. She's a person I like and respect enormously, and she's one of too few black women CEOs in tech or in any other sector. And when I finished giving the talk, she pulled me aside and she said, "Kim, I'm excited to roll out Radical Candor. I think it's really going to help me build the kind of career I want." But she said, "I got to tell you, it's much harder for me to roll it out than it is for you." And she went on to explain to me that as soon as she would offer folks even the most gentle, compassionate criticism, they would call her an angry black woman. And I knew this was true as soon as she said it, and I knew how unfair it was because she's like one of the most even keeled, cheerful people I've ever worked with.

(01:12:49):
And I realized a bunch of things at the same time when she told me that, the first was that I had not been the kind of colleague that I aspire to be, that I imagined myself to be. I had failed even to notice the extent to which she had to show up unfailingly, cheerful and pleasant in every meeting we had ever been in together even though she had what to be ticked off about as we all do at work. So I had failed to be an upstander, a good colleague. The second thing I realized was that I had also failed to acknowledge when I was experiencing different versions of bias, prejudice and bullying. And I think part of the reason it's kind of hard for the author of a book called Radical Candor to admit she was in denial. But I had been in denial about a bunch of experiences I had had in the workplace.

(01:13:41):
I had pretended that a whole host of things were not happening, that were in fact happening. And I think part of the reason why I did that was that I never wanted to think of myself as a victim, but even less than wanting to think of myself as a victim did I want to think of myself as the culprit. So I'd been even more deeply in denial about the times that I had said or done things that hurt other people who I worked with, said or done things that were biased or worse. I had bullied people before. And by the way, when you become a leader, you're much more prone to bullying even if you don't think of yourself as a bully, which I certainly don't think of myself as a bully, but that doesn't mean I never bullied anyone. And then the last thing I realized was that as a leader, I imagined that I was creating these BS free zones, but I had allowed all manner of BS to pass. So that was what prompted me to write the next book, Radical Respect, which you can pre-order right now and please do.

Lenny (01:14:41):
That was my next question. Talk more about this book. What is it about? Where people find it?

Kim Scott (01:14:46):
Radical Respect comes out in May. You can pre-order it now. Anywhere you buy books, at your local independent bookstore, I'm speaking at a conference of independent bookstore owners soon you can pre-order it on Amazon or Barnes Noble or anywhere else you buy buy books.

Lenny (01:15:05):
And who would you say it's most for?

Kim Scott (01:15:08):
So there are chapters in that book about things leaders can do. There are chapters in the book about things you can do if you're harmed by bias, prejudice, or bullying. There are chapters in the book about how to be a great upstander, how to be a better colleague, and there are chapters in the book about how to become part of the solution, not part of the problem when you're the culprit. And I think we all find ourselves in all four of those roles at different moments in time, and I don't think there's any one group who can solve this problem. Everyone is responsible for creating a more respectful work environment.

Lenny (01:15:48):
Awesome. We'll link to that in the show notes.

Kim Scott (01:15:50):
Amazing.

Lenny (01:15:51):
To leave people with a very tactical next step. What's one thing they could do this week today to get better at Radical Candor, to start building that muscle?

Kim Scott (01:16:00):
I would love it if everyone would write down their go-to question what are the words that will come out of your mouth and practice it. Practice it in front of the mirror and then practice it with a friend and refine it. Just figure out what, because it is uncomfortable to solicit feedback from others. They don't want to give it to you and you don't really want to hear it. So if everybody can write down their go-to question and then put five minutes in your calendar of someone you're going to ask that question of.

Lenny (01:16:31):
And that calendar entry, I was going to come back to it actually. So you do the one-on-one agenda, adding the question, the calendar entry is for people you don't have a one-on-one with, pick someone that you're going to ask that you're not meeting with regularly.

Kim Scott (01:16:42):
Absolutely. Or add it to the bottom of your next one-on-one agenda. That's fair too. Either one.

Lenny (01:16:44):
Amazing. Kim, is there anything else you want to leave folks with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kim Scott (01:16:52):
I think just remember, you do not have to choose between being successful and being a jerk. You can be a successful kind person.

Lenny (01:17:00):
Oh, I love that. Amazing. Okay, well with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kim Scott (01:17:07):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:17:08):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? You've already mentioned a few but what do you want to share?

Kim Scott (01:17:14):
Yes, I've mentioned a couple. Please do buy Radical Respect, I believe that the more novels people read, the better. People often ask me, what can I do to move up on the care personally dimension of Radical Candor and read more novels? This is the best way I know of to build compassion for other people, to understand the emotional signals that might be coming at you. I mean, some of my favorite novels are Middlemarch. I try to reread that all the time. Anything that Toni Morrison wrote, the Bluest Eye is one of my favorite, but also Song of Solomon. It just such a brilliant writer and will help you enter into the lives of people that you haven't entered into. I think that Orlando by Virginia Woolf is another one of my favorites. And Robertson Davies, the Deptford Trilogy is an incredible set of novels to read. I'm cheating now and giving you three.

Lenny (01:18:27):
The more the merrier.

Kim Scott (01:18:27):
Yes, Alice Walker, the Color Purple is another one of my very favorite books, so I recommend reading more novels.

Lenny (01:18:34):
I love this leaning into fiction that doesn't come up often on this podcast, so this is great. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Kim Scott (01:18:47):
I watched all 19 seasons of Grey's Anatomy with my daughter during and after COVID. That was really fun.

Lenny (01:18:55):
Actually. I did the same thing with my wife. We didn't do all the seasons, but we watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy.

Kim Scott (01:18:59):
We watched every single one. It's still coming out.

Lenny (01:19:04):
Yeah, it's funny to see which characters continue and which I die off, leave.

Kim Scott (01:19:07):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:19:09):
Oh man. Okay. Funny

Kim Scott (01:19:10):
And Shonda Rhimes, I mean, watch her TED Talk, amazing person.

Lenny (01:19:14):
All right, we'll link to that in the show notes. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people that might be helpful to folks interviewing?

Kim Scott (01:19:22):
The question that I like to ask is just tell me the story of your career. And I know that's kind of, maybe it's a hard, it seems like a softball, but it's actually can be unfairly hard or not. I don't know, unfairly hard, but I always learn a lot about people from how they tell the story of their life and their career. And then what I try to do is they'll say a couple of things that really interest me and I sort of double-click down into the details of a couple of aspects. I love people's life stories, so that makes it a more fun conversation for me. Often people like talking about themselves so it's not too painful for them, but you also learn all kinds of unexpected things.

Lenny (01:20:13):
And is there anything you're looking for in an answer that's like, this is a good person to hire or is it mostly information? I'm just gathering a lot of background.

Kim Scott (01:20:22):
I find that I learn how the person approaches setbacks from a story, from the way they tell a story. I learn whether a person is able to identify mistakes they made. I mean, if you say, "Tell me the story of your career," if there's not a couple of mistakes in there, I also find that when they talk about accomplishments and then I double click on it, I learn a lot about what a person really did. Sometimes a person will claim credit for something that just happened that they had very little to actually to do with, and I learn about very often. I find that a good way to learn about people's skills and depth of knowledge.

Lenny (01:21:10):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Kim Scott (01:21:14):
Yes. I love my new it's called Attitude, and they're shampoo bars and conditioner bars, so it comes in cardboard, wrapped in paper. There's no plastic. It's much more environmentally friendly, and I have long hair. It gets very tingly and the conditioner works, so I recommend.

Lenny (01:21:35):
Very unique suggestion. Is there a favorite motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with people, find useful to come back to in work or in life?

Kim Scott (01:21:46):
"It's not mean. It's clear." This is something someone told me on the streets of Manhattan. It's actually the origin story of Radical Candor. I was walking my dog, almost got hit by a cab, and this man, a perfect stranger, looked at me and he said, "I can tell you love that dog." That was all he had to do to move up on the care personally dimension, but he says, "You're going to kill that dog if you don't teach her to sit." And he pointed at the ground this kind of harsh gesture. He said, "Sit." The dog sat, had no idea she even knew what that meant. And I kind of looked up at him in amazement and he said, "It's not mean. It's clear." And then the light changed and he walked off leaving me with words to live by. So I think about that stranger all the time.

Lenny (01:22:30):
Such a good story. Final question. I read online that you started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow at some point in your life. Can you please explain this part of your life?

Kim Scott (01:22:41):
Yes. So I studied Russian literature in college, very practical major. And then I moved to what was then the Soviet Union in 1990 when I graduated from college, and I wound up taking a job with, first of all, I was with an investment company and then they pulled out of Russia and put the money in China. And so I wanted to stay in Russia and through a friend of a friend, I got a job working for this diamond company called Lazare Kaplan, new York-based diamond company, and they were trying to figure out what they should do in Russia. And I found out there was an opportunity to start this diamond cutting factory. And it was actually my first management job because I had to hire these diamond cutters and I had to hire them away from these Russian diamond cutting factories and I knew nothing about management or business or anything.

(01:23:44):
I'd studied Russian literature. I knew a lot about Dostoyevsky, so I thought it was going to be easy though. I was like, well, the ruble is collapsing. I'm going to pay them in dollars. Of course they'll come work for me. But they didn't take the job right away. To my surprise, they wanted to have a picnic. And at the picnic we brought a bottle of vodka, and there's a rule in Russia, if you open a bottle, you got to finish the bottle.

(01:24:07):
So by the end of the bottle of vodka, I realized that what I could offer that the state could not offer them was to give a damn about them. They wanted to know that I would be a manager who would get them out of Russia if things went sideways there. And as you can imagine, I've been thinking a lot about, they were all men, about these men because I haven't been able to get them out. And I'm devastated by what Russia has done to Ukraine, but that was the moment when I realized that management really matters, and that to be good at it, you have to care about other people. And that was what made it interesting to me.

Lenny (01:24:53):
Man, that is a heavy first job as a manager.

Kim Scott (01:24:56):
Yeah. Yes, it was.

Lenny (01:24:58):
Wow, Kim, this was awesome. I think we're going to help a lot of people become better leaders. I think we're going to help a lot of companies change their culture. I'm so honored that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow up and learn more about your stuff? And then two, how can listeners be helpful to you?

Kim Scott (01:25:18):
Radicalcandor.com is our website, and I'm not much on Twitter slash X anymore, but you can find us. We do a lot of posting on LinkedIn. I think that the thing that people can help me do is to send us a note. You can also email us radicalcandor@radicalcandor.com and let us know what could we do in podcasts like this or in our materials? What could we do that would make it easier for you to put these ideas into practice? Because Radical Candor is, it's about behavior change, and it sounds easy, but it's really hard, and we're always trying to figure out how to help people walk the talk here.

Lenny (01:26:02):
I think doing this podcast is going to make a dent in that goal.

Kim Scott (01:26:05):
Oh, good.

Lenny (01:26:06):
Kim, thank you so much for being here.

Kim Scott (01:26:08):
Thank you. I really enjoyed it.

Lenny (01:26:11):
Same. Bye everyone.

# What sets great teams apart | Lane Shackleton (CPO of Coda)

## Transcript

Lane Shackleton (00:00:00):
Moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit. I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous, in my opinion, way to ask this question. A much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:00:51):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Lane Shackleton. Lane is Chief Product Officer at Coda where he's held the role for over eight years. Before that, he was Group Product Manager at YouTube, a Product Specialist at Google, and as you'll hear, he started his career as an Alaskan mountain guide and then as a manual reviewer of Google AdWords ads. Lane is an incredibly deep thinker, very first principles oriented, and has built an incredible product team and culture at Coda. In part, he's done that by studying the principles and rituals of great product leaders and great product teams. In our conversation, Lane shares what he's learned, what he's found great PMs and great teams do differently. He shares a bunch of his favorite rituals and principles, how you can implement them on your own team, plus a really clever and unique way of understanding if you're making progress in your career, plus so much more. I could talk to Lane for hours, but we tried to keep this to under an hour and a half. With that, I bring you Lane Shackleton after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:55):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:02:41):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:03:03):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

(00:04:04):
Lane, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lane Shackleton (00:04:07):
So glad to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:09):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've always really admired the way that you write about product, the way you think about product, and it feels like Coda has one of the strongest and also the most thoughtful product teams out there. And so I am really excited to have you on here and learn from what you've learned over the years. My first question is completely unrelated. I have to ask. Your last name's Shackleton. Any relation to a certain very famous Antarctic explorer?

Lane Shackleton (00:04:36):
Yeah. It's probably distant at best. I wish it was close. I wish I could claim it was my father or grandfather. But I definitely grew up with those stories and reading a lot about him as a kid. In high school we read Endurance, which is a great book if you haven't read it. It's an amazing story. Very inspiring how he put people first and brought back all of his men from this journey to the South Pole. So have taken a lot of lessons from that, but that's as close as I can come to the greatness of Ernest Shackleton.

Lenny (00:05:09):
Okay. So there's a connection. When I think of Shackleton, I also think of the ad that he ran for recruiting people to join his journey. Low chance of survival, incredibly hard, chance for glory if you succeed, something like that.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:23):
It's a wonderful ad. I think I had a mug of that when I was a kid. Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:28):
Amazing. Okay. So on that same topic, I noticed maybe your first job was a mountain guide in Alaska. Was that inspired by this legacy? And also why did you decide not to pursue that and get into product management? Completely different life.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:42):
Yeah. Yeah. Very, very different. Very different time. Didn't have kids back then. I think I was convinced at the time I wanted a career outside. Just loved spending time in the mountains and climbing, things like that. To be honest, I wasn't the best guide. There were a lot of amazing guides out there that just had ... They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person. And the reason that you do that is because if someone falls in a crevasse, you want to be able to stop them or pull them out.

(00:06:48):
So I was roped to a very nice client that I was guiding and he fell pretty close to the top on our way down. And luckily we were able to self-arrest and arrest that fall. But I spent probably the next six hours walking down that mountain thinking the same thing over and over again, which is I really don't want to die roped to someone that I barely know and don't trust or love. So that was the last season that I guided. But tons of great memories and learnings and I think it impacted my life in a pretty significant way.

Lenny (00:07:29):
Damn. Software much lower stakes. I guess just while we're on this topic, is there any parallels or big lesson you learned from that experience that you bring to product?

Lane Shackleton (00:07:37):
One is just preparation. I think when you go climbing or when you guide climbing, you spend months and months preparing for usually a few days of climbing. So there's that kind of preparation. There's also just a million checklists. So before you go on an expedition, you may check a checklist of all your equipment, stuff like that a dozen times or more. So you ensure redundancy across all your systems. So that was definitely a parallel. The other thing I think about a lot is just how to stay calm in challenging or scary scenarios. We had another instance where I had a client pull a big chunk of rock off and break their feet and I was the junior guide on that particular instance and the more senior guide looked at me, looked at the situation and was like, "Okay, we're getting this guy out of here right now." Put him on his back and we basically took turns carrying him out for a couple miles I'll just never forget instances like that where the clarity of stay calm, assess the situation, prioritize, take action. There's a mini version of that when you're building software, I think. So experiences like that, I think, even though I only did it for a handful of summers, were pretty profound.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Yeah. What a very different life that life path would've been.

Lane Shackleton (00:09:11):
Pre kids. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Oh, man. So you mentioned your writing, you mentioned that this is something you want to write about. Shifting to the core topic of our chat, it's very clear that you spent a lot of time studying how great product managers operate and how great product teams operate. You've been doing a bunch of writing on the principles of great product management and also the rituals of great teams. And so I want to spend a bunch of time trying to extract as much as I can from your learning so that listeners can learn. Essentially what are principles of great product managers, what are rituals of great teams and generally how do the best teams operate? And my first question is just why is this something that you started doing? What pulled you into spending so much time and effort trying to understand how the best teams and people operate?

Lane Shackleton (00:09:53):
Yeah. Yeah. I've been asking myself that question a little bit lately. There's a few reasons. One reason is I just found myself giving a similar set of advice in one on ones. And so I think anytime you find as a leader yourself repeating the same lessons, it should be a good flag to say like, oh, I should probably scale this in some way. And as you know, as soon as you write something down, you have to clarify your own thinking and so it becomes very useful for that. And I don't think I quite expected how useful it would be in that sense. Writing something down and then putting it out there, you start to get feedback back of where you might've been right or where you might not be right. And so for me it's been a good learning experience there as well. I think the second reason is I've always been pretty frustrated with career ladders. Most companies have career ladders with 10 or 15 levels and as soon as they hit some scale levels, there's levels between levels and I feel like I looked at the one at Google and you needed a PhD to decipher it and interpret how to operate within it.

(00:11:11):
And so that's one piece of the construct. If you think more broadly though, they aren't consistent across companies, so now you're in a situation where you're in your version of the rat race. And so I found that I basically wanted to have a broader set of principles that transcended level. So things that could be true when you are an ICPM starting your career and things that can also be true when you're the head of product or running a product team or things like that. That's one. I won't rant further on that but I think that's one piece of it.

(00:11:49):
And then I think the last reason I'll mention is I was pretty inspired by a talk that is by this guy named Brett Victor, who's like a prototyper thinker. May have heard of his work. He has this talk called Inventing on Principle. And in the early days of Coda, one of our first designers, this guy Jeremy Britten, showed this talk to the company and my mind was blown. And I think it was one of those examples of someone developing a clear view of what principles they should operate with and then following that principle. And it was just a meta example of how important it is and how impactful it can be when you decide on a principle and then follow it. And so ever since then I've been thinking what are my principles as it pertains to building software and other things. So those are the three reasons that led me to start writing these things down.

Lenny (00:12:49):
Amazing. We're going to find that talk and link to it in the show notes. I want to ask about what principles you've come to, but I also want to understand how you actually ended up doing ladders and performance review stuff at Coda. Would it be better to talk about that later after we go through some of these things or is there something you want to share first of just how you think about it at Coda?

Lane Shackleton (00:13:06):
When we were doing career ladders, first of all, we put it off for quite a bit of time and that was based on the advice of a lot of other leaders that said as soon as you introduce this, then the incentives flip from being company focused to being individual focused. So I think we delayed it for a good bit of time. There came a time where we decided, "Hey look, we really do need to provide better guidance here about what it means to grow and what it means to be great." And so about the same time we were doing the levels thing I started writing down some of the principles that I've been publishing. One of the things that I think about a lot when talking about levels is just how to keep everyone oriented toward their team and their company. And I think that we've done a really good job of that over the years. So levels aren't by any means at the forefront of any company discussion. In fact, we don't use titles that much.

Lenny (00:14:11):
You said that it's not specific to role. Do you mean the same leveling attributes are the same from design and product and engineering?

Lane Shackleton (00:14:19):
We basically have five levels and we call them role stages and they go from apprentice to principal. So apprentice is ... Rope analogy here is learns about rope. Practitioner is can tie basic knots, shown complex knots. Given a problem, they can do it. Career is you can calculate rope strength. You know a lot about knots. Principal is basically invented nylon. So the bar is really, really high for principal in these levels and I think that that's appropriate. It should be aspirational that the bar is exceptionally high at the highest level of our role stages. I find it's a pretty good process to draw maybe a little bit of contrast with other companies. I think most other companies, especially large companies have 10 to 15 levels. I think we've made a really conscious choice to have only five. I think the other bit of contrast I would draw is basically role stages are not visible across the whole company. We're not showing levels of any individual PM or designer, and that's partially because we just don't want to put a big focus on it. And then probably the biggest difference is we have a centralized compensation committee and that's who decides compensation and so it's not the manager that drives your compensation. So those are some differences.

Lenny (00:15:52):
Super cool. I've never seen it done this way before. I think it's an awesome example of first principles thinking, which I see a lot come out from your product team. And then just to make sure I heard you right, these five stages are roughly the same across role, so designers have the same five and they're described similarly.

Lane Shackleton (00:16:08):
That's right. They're described similarly at a high level, but then the specifics if you get into it are a little bit different.

Lenny (00:16:15):
Okay. I'm going to ask about what the principles are, or a few of them that you can share. But one other very tactical question. At what size of product teams, say just PMs, did you start to develop this framework?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:26):
We were probably at 20-ish PMs and designers when we did that.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Okay. So let me just ask, what are some of these principles you've narrowed it on as principles of great product managers?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:38):
Maybe it's helpful to start with a little higher level context on the unifying thesis. I think the unifying thesis is the core job of a product person in general is to turn ambiguity into clarity. And if you think about the job of a product leader or a product manager, everything is ambiguous all the time. It's like what's my role on this team? What problem are we solving? Who's the target customer? What prototype is going to solve this particular problem? So it's literally everything. And so if you're going to do the job well, you really need to get good at spotting ambiguity and turning it into clarity. And so the obvious question that follows from that is okay, great, that sounds like a great Hallmark card, but how do you actually do that? And so I think the principles that I've been writing down are very personal. They're my take on how to do this.

(00:17:41):
So the first one that I wrote about was systems not goals. And one of the ways that I started this post ... I'm a big fan of getting inspiration from outside of tech and so one of the stories that I tell is basically the story of Jerry Seinfeld. If you haven't seen the documentary Comedian, it's amazing, it's definitely worth watching. But the story goes, he's done Seinfeld the show and he's got all this material from the last 15 years and he comes in one day and he says, "Look, I'm going to throw away all my material and I'm going to start fresh." And this is unheard of in comedy for someone to just throw away all their old material and start fresh. And so the question is what does he do next? And the thing that he does is he sets a goal, which is basically to build up to an hour of material again.

(00:18:34):
But the goal isn't that important. What's important here is the system. So the system that he uses is he writes for an hour every morning, doesn't write for more if he doesn't want to, and then he goes and performs at night. And so when you rinse and repeat that system, do it hundreds of times, that's how he builds up from five minutes to 15 minutes to 30 minutes of material. And so I think that I take a lot of inspiration from that and I think product people can generally, which is instead of being obsessed with the goal, be obsessed with the system that gets you there. And so the phrase I sometimes use is goals with good intentions don't work. I really need to give a common example. A really common example is teams that are trying to learn about customers or do research. And one thing I've observed is a team may have a goal like an OKR of talking to 10 customers this quarter and they may or may not hit that OKR. And then if you watch closely, the next quarter, they may not have a goal of talking to customers anymore. And so their learning is going up and down.

(00:19:49):
And to draw a contrast, that's just really different than a team that has some default on system for talking to customers. Every few times a week they're talking to customers for whatever reason. And the impact of that is really hard to see until you understand that the latter team tends to have really good product instincts or really good customer instincts. It's because they've just had this default on mindset of talking to customers. And in the early days of Coda, we actually did something similar. We had a time allotted on Fridays and it was basically, it was on the calendar a customer or a potential customer was coming in and so you knew that it was going to happen and you had to have something to show. And so sometimes we'd be scrambling the three hours before to have a prototype ready for a customer. Sometimes we would've had something that we've been baking for a while. But the point is that it was default on. And so the way that we developed good customer instincts was not the goal, it was really just the system behind it. So that's one that I'm passionate about and I think it also translates into a lot of the rituals that we talk a lot about.

Lenny (00:21:06):
There's so many directions I can go with this. I really like this one. It reminds me of something I did at Airbnb where we had a lunch with a host every Friday with the team and we had a community person find someone in San Francisco that's a host. And there's no agenda, it's just let's have lunch and meet the team. Curious what you're wondering.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:22):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:21:22):
And Airbnb hosts are always so nice and has such a pleasant experience. Also makes me think about this book, The Score Takes Care of Itself.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:30):
Yep.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Have you read that?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Where it's just do the fundamentals and you'll win?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:34):
Totally.

Lenny (00:21:34):
The other thing it reminds me of is I have this quote hanging in my office here. I Believe it's from the Rick Rubin book. And the quote is, "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable."

Lane Shackleton (00:21:48):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:49):
I feel like you just changed art-

Lane Shackleton (00:21:51):
Yeah. Rick Rubin's amazing.

Lenny (00:21:52):
Oh my god, it's so good. Just every section is this quotable thing I want ... I need to hold onto this thing.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:58):
Yeah. He's got a great thing on listening. I really admire what he says about listening and I think that a lot of PMs could take that lesson, which is-

Lenny (00:22:10):
Yeah. What is that lesson?

Lane Shackleton (00:22:11):
The way he talks about it is essentially you want to listen and absorb every fragment of what that person is saying, including their body language and everything else, and try to turn off the side which is crafting your response or figuring out what you're going to say next or what the problem with their argument is or whatever. It's quite hard to do. Because your default mode is always the next step of the conversation. But I think if you can really challenge yourself, like he says, to pause and really try to internalize holistically what that person's saying, it's pretty powerful.

Lenny (00:22:55):
I was actually just reading that chapter and the next chapter is about this idea of the beginner's mind. I don't know if you remember that. I feel like people get sniped by Rick Rubin stuff. But anyway, I'm going to go down this thread. He talks about how AlphaZero or AlphaGo, the first AI thing that beat humans at Go and how there was this move it made, move 37 in the game that was just like ... The person the AI was playing walked out of the room. He's like, "I don't even know what just happened. This is out of anything I've ever imagined." And it won. And the lesson there it was trained not on what we've learned, but it trained itself and figured things out from first principles and then came up with this thing we've never even comprehended. And so it's a really good example of the power of coming from a beginner's mind and not being influenced by what's already been done.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:41):
Yeah. We have a walkthrough ritual that we do.

Lenny (00:23:45):
Tell me more.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:46):
The prompt is essentially put yourself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about this topic whatsoever and have beginner's mind and then walk through with five or 10 people watching you and let's fix all the problems that we see.

Lenny (00:24:05):
Okay. I want to talk about rituals. We're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Is there any other principles that you can share either just on a high level or in depth that you've come across? And I know people can go to your Substack and read this. And by the way, what's your Substack URL for people that want to check it out?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:21):
Just lane.substack.com.

Lenny (00:24:24):
Sweet. We'll definitely link into it. Yeah. Any other principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:28):
I think the other one is cathedrals, not bricks, and then the other one is proactive, not reactive. Cathedrals, not bricks I think is a classic one. I think I had a moment of realization and talking to Shishir in a one-on-one when I was at YouTube bemoaning the fact that my team wasn't performing to the potential that I thought they had. And he had a very pointed and unexpected question, which is like, "Do they know their cathedral? Do they have a cathedral?" And I'm sitting there like, "Man, what are you talking about? We're talking about performing as a team and you're asking me about cathedrals." And then he explained the cathedral story, which I can talk about. In that-

Lenny (00:25:11):
What's the cathedral story?

Lane Shackleton (00:25:11):
It was quite clarifying.

Lenny (00:25:13):
Yeah. Do share.

Lane Shackleton (00:25:14):
Yeah. The cathedral story is basically you walk up to three people, they're laying bricks. You ask the first person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take the bricks from over here and I put them on that sack over there." You ask the second person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take this little cement and I put it on top of the brick that that person lays." You ask the third person, "What are you doing?" And they say, "Well, we're building a cathedral." And the core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks. And I think it's really, really easy to do when PMs are really busy on a day-to-day to just be one task after the other, really execution oriented and maybe not take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is. And I think we've learned many times that one unexpected bit of this is that everybody needs to see a different facet of the cathedral.

(00:26:22):
So very often ... And I've made this mistake before plenty of times. Very often people will do a great writeup on vision or strategy or whatever it is and the result is people can't quite see their version of what this broader arc is or this broader cathedral is. And so one of the things that we have tried to do when we go through big planning cycles is show all the different sides of this. So instead of just having a writeup, we may have a writeup, we may couple that with a metric, we may couple that with directional mocks and what the billboard might look like or how our homepage may change. And really what we're trying to do is take the mystery out of the set of broader constraints or where we're headed. I think great product teams and great PM leaders tend to always orient their teams towards a broader cathedral as opposed to laying bricks.

Lenny (00:27:26):
Such a beautiful metaphor. Reminds me of this other quote I just looked up while you're chatting. "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

Lane Shackleton (00:27:39):
Classic. Classic. It's Antoine.

Lenny (00:27:42):
That is right. Antoine de St. Exupery. Okay. Something I was curious about as you were chatting also is for folks that want to develop their own principles and define how they want to think about products, is there anything you found to be useful in helping emerge these into principles that you can come to? Is it just sitting around thinking? Is there anything else you've done that has helped you define these things?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:06):
Probably two things. One is reading really broadly. So I think not just reading PM style literature. Like I said, I tend to get a lot of inspiration from outside of tech. I think that's one thing. I think the other thing is insofar as you get the opportunity to mentor other people, think about what you're saying to these people. Think about, okay, this person came to me with this challenge. What was my response? Why was that my response? Am I giving that response a lot of times? Okay, maybe this is a more deeply held belief. So I think noticing those instances was helpful for me.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Are there any books or topics or areas that you found most inspirational when you talk about reading and studying other non-product tech?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:53):
I mean definitely sports. I would say sports is really interesting to me. Team sports. I've always been a huge fan of everything team sports. Storytelling. Go look at some of the best storytellers in the world and they're actually out there on a stage telling stories. There's a book called Storyworthy that I really like.

Lenny (00:29:15):
I was just going to mention that. That book is so good. Somebody mentioned this on the podcast and I read it. It's the most useful practical book for how to tell stories.

Lane Shackleton (00:29:23):
It's so good. The insight is amazing. Just in case your listeners are interested, the insight is basically the nugget of a great story is five seconds of transformation. So if you just orient everything else around that moment of transformation, then you end up usually telling a reasonably good story. I had a conversation with the author right after I read that book because I was just totally enamored with it. And then we ended up bringing him into Coda and he gave a great talk. So yeah, big plug for Matthew Dicks.

Lenny (00:29:58):
The other thing that stuck with me also from that same ... We're just going on all kinds of tangents. From that same insight is, and I watch movies completely differently now, where basically the characters you meet at the beginning of the story, they're going to be completely opposite at the end of the story because of this transformation that takes place. So I'm watching movies with my wife now, I'm like, "Okay, she's very shy right now. She's going to be very extroverted by the end of this movie." Or, "They love each other. Oh, they're going to have a lot of problems." That's so interesting. Oh, that's such a good idea. Okay, I'm going to get this guy on hopefully. And he's a Moth champion basically.

Lane Shackleton (00:30:30):
Yeah. I would say as maybe a principal version of this, the way that you learn or the way that everyone including me learns new things is you go seek out the best at that given craft. So in this case, you go to the Moth StorySLAM you see some really good stories. If you ever watch these on YouTube. And then you just unpack what they're doing and how they're doing it. And then obviously I think the other way to learn quickly is to throw yourself in the deep end. So insofar as you can put yourself in situations that are uncomfortable or force you to do things like tell a story or force you to come up with a clear strategy, you should always opt into those, especially early in your career.

Lenny (00:31:18):
The first thing you said, that's basically the whole premise of this podcast. Find the best at all these things and learn from them, extract and share.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:24):
And the world is much better for it. This podcast is an amazing resource.

Lenny (00:31:29):
Thanks man.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:29):
You've done something very special.

Lenny (00:31:31):
I appreciate it. This podcast episode is already very special. The point you just made reminds me of something that I heard you talk about, which is this oh shit moment. I don't know if it's related to what you shared of just giving people a sense of whether they're making progress in their career. Can you talk about that?

Lane Shackleton (00:31:49):
Sure. Yeah. I think I picked this up originally from Seth Godin, the author, and it just totally stuck with me. The basic thesis is that moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit, I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. And so I have found that they turn out to be a pretty good way to calibrate whether someone is growing in their career. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous in my opinion way to ask this question. And a much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:33:04):
That is so good. Making me think about this podcast where I never wanted to do podcasts. I'm like I'm not a podcast person. I just want to sit there and type out newsletters. How cool is that? And I'm like, no, I got to do it because it's hard. And I'm glad I did it. It also reminds me of this quote that I love that I always think back to. "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek."

Lane Shackleton (00:33:26):
Nice. That reminds me of ... Have you read the book The Obstacle is the Way?

Lenny (00:33:31):
No. Say More.

Lane Shackleton (00:33:33):
It's a great book by Ryan Holiday. And the core thesis is ... It's a bit about stoicism. But the core idea is essentially instead of running away from obstacles, you should be running toward them and that's where you experience either the most growth or the most profound moments of your life. He gives a lot of examples in that book of people throughout history who made that choice. And I think he's also given that talk to hundreds of sports teams. It's a good book. Worth reading.

Lenny (00:34:08):
It's so hard. It's so hard to do hard things, man. So we've been talking about principles of great product managers. You also spent a lot of time looking at the rituals of great product teams. And I know you're working on this handbook that I'm excited to learn more about. Can you just talk about ... I guess one, where this idea came from of studying rituals of great teams and also just how do you actually go about learning about these rituals? I know you have this really interesting process.

Lane Shackleton (00:34:31):
Yeah. In general, I'm a big believer in good design and good product starts with noticing. Tony Fadell has a great talk on this. So I think a bunch of us that are really obsessed with rituals, we just honestly try to be great at noticing. So see something happening with a customer, ask a few questions, get introduced to their team, hear about something interesting from a non-customer, ask for an intro, end up just probing and asking a lot of questions. And then in many cases nowadays with Coda, we're building new rituals alongside people. So someone has a creative idea about how to implement something and we're like partners or collaborators with them on that, which is honestly incredibly fun to just see people's creativity expressed in a tool and then by extension the social construct that they exist in. So that's a little bit about how we got started in that whole process. And then of course Shishir is writing a book called Rituals of Great Teams so we've been cataloging those. We've been hosting a bunch of rituals dinners where we basically get people together for a dinner and we usually have three or four presenters at those dinners. It's just a great chance to learn and think about how the engine runs in a lot of these companies.

Lenny (00:36:03):
What are some rituals that you've learned from these dinners and these and this research you've done that have really stuck with you?

Lane Shackleton (00:36:10):
There are so many. It's hard to choose. Maybe I'll choose two that are top of mind. One is Dharmesh Shah has this ritual from HubSpot called flash tags. Have you heard of this?

Lenny (00:36:24):
No.

Lane Shackleton (00:36:27):
We've all probably been in the situation where someone gives you feedback and you either under interpret it or over interpret it. And as an organization, I think the core principle here is like you want to be calibrated on how much to pay attention to a bit of feedback. And so he outlines four flash tags. He presented this in one of our dinners. And I absolutely love the phrasing of these as someone who's given a lot of feedback on product stuff in their career. So it ranges from ... I think it's FYI, suggestion, recommendation, plea. So FYI is basically like I had a thought, take it or leave it kind of thing. Suggestion is ... And he uses this hill dying metaphor. So is this a hill I'm going to die on? And FYI is there's no hill in sight. Suggestion is there's a hill. I'm not going to die on it but this is what I would do if I were you. You can take it or leave it. Recommendation is I'm climbing the hill. I'm not going to die here, but I've thought about this a lot, so don't ignore this.

(00:37:41):
And then the fourth one, plea, is hopefully rarely used in the organization. It's like, I don't like dying on hills. That's not what we do here. But this is a pretty good candidate for it. You should really trust me. And so we have ended up using that. I was actually just at an offsite and someone gave a lightning talk to our team on how valuable this has been just to calibrate, hey, we got 100 pieces of feedback and there's one plea. Okay, let's spend our time on that. Or there's a whole bunch of FYIs. I think we're fine. Let's keep going. No worries.

Lenny (00:38:20):
That's amazing. It's interesting none of them are just do it this way. I imagine that's very intentional.

Lane Shackleton (00:38:25):
Yeah. Honestly it's a sign of ... In Dharmesh's case, I don't know him super well, but it's a sign of a really experienced leader to know that scale. But every time I look at the scale and I'm weighing where I am between suggestion or recommendation, I have to giggle to myself.

Lenny (00:38:45):
And how do you actually use it? In the feedback you put a hashtag plea kind of thing?

Lane Shackleton (00:38:51):
The way gets used in code docs and the way I think other companies have made it a ritual is you'll have a feedback table and you'll write your feedback and then there'll just be a little select list and you can select between those four. And usually what people do is they include the description so you can as you're choosing it, think do I really feel that strongly about this? And honestly, it's good hygiene. Otherwise, every bit of feedback is taken the same. Which just fundamentally the impact of that is it slows everything down because now you're looking at a list of 100 pieces of feedback and you're going like, "Oh man, we got to address all this feedback." Whereas as soon as you distinguish between what's most important, it's much easier to sort through that.

Lenny (00:39:46):
What about if it's in person? Do you say this is a plea or this is a FYI?

Lane Shackleton (00:39:50):
Oh, I've definitely heard that in many meetings. Are you making a recommendation or are you making a plea?

Lenny (00:39:57):
Amazing.

Lane Shackleton (00:39:58):
And making the person think through that choice I think is just a very helpful shared language.

Lenny (00:40:04):
I imagine one of the other benefits of this is I think most leaders that rise up the ranks eventually realize anything they say in a meeting is going to be taken really seriously and the team's going to rush back and be like, "Oh, Lane told us to change this thing." I imagine it helps you just make it clear. No, you don't need to actually change this. It's just my thoughts.

Lane Shackleton (00:40:21):
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:22):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company. I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous, but they did find some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month. Probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.

(00:41:21):
According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early, and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny at E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.

(00:42:15):
Any other rituals that stand out as really interesting, either more recently you've learned or something you're just like, oh, wow, that was a genius?

Lane Shackleton (00:42:21):
I guess one that I get asked about a lot on our team is called Catalyst. And I guess maybe to set some context on this one, in most product teams, the review forum is just a really important part of the product development process. And the core insight for most review forums or product reviews or decision forums is that they generally suffer from two problems that are hard to spot unless you've sat through hundreds of them. The first is they have standing attendees, and the second is they're normally single-threaded, meaning they're normally one topic at a time. So maybe I'll talk about both of those because I think they're not exactly intuitive. So when you think about what happens with a standing set of attendees, you either have the situation where you have too many people in the meeting or you have not enough people in the meeting, and both of those can cause problems.

(00:43:25):
So if you've ever been in a meeting, I certainly have, where it's like, "Hey, do we have the salesperson who knows most about this or do we have the engineer who's actually implementing this here? Oh, great. They're not here? They're not a part of the standing set of attendees?" You either have to reschedule the meeting or worse, you just do the discussion without the person who's most knowledgeable, which seems crazy in retrospect. The second problem is single-threaded. So one topic at a time. So if you think about if a product development process is somewhat of a chaotic assembly line for a second, your review or your decision forum ends up being a big time bottleneck in many cases. And obviously you want to be in a situation where product people have a lot of autonomy and they can make most of the decisions themselves. And I'm a big believer in decentralized leadership and all of that, but there are things that cut across the company that need to get reviewed by a broader set of stakeholders.

(00:44:29):
And so what happens when those things are single threaded is either the meeting is really long, so it's a three-hour review meeting once a week, and by the end everyone is about to fall asleep, or it's really short and it's really hard to get on the calendar. You're like, "Oh, can we get on the calendar in two weeks?" And the downside of the not being able to get on the calendar is that now you've just slowed down the whole velocity of the company because the throughput of your review meeting is really slow. So we built Catalyst to really solve those two problems. And so the way it works is it's essentially three one hour blocks throughout the week, and the assumption is that the whole company is free. So you can get anyone in the company for those three hours. And each topic has essentially four roles. Driver, maker, braintrust, and interested. It's a very transparent system.

(00:45:28):
So a salesperson can say, "Oh, I'm interested in this product development review. I'm just going to mark myself as interested." And then the driver is the person who's actually going to drive the meeting, drive the decision, drive the outcome, things like that. And basically, this is all centralized in one doc. And what happens is the day before, that hold that's on calendar gets removed, and then you have specific topics that get added. So there may be three topics going all at the same time because they don't have overlapping attendees. And the impact of this, I think if you really watch it in progress is huge. You basically have many topics running all at the same time, so the throughput is much better and you have the right attendees every single time, and you have a clear set of drivers and roles in these meetings. So that means that we can review work much, much faster with the right people, and ideally that results in more value to our customers, more things getting shipped, just a higher velocity organization. So that's one that we get asked about a lot. And actually a couple of weeks ago, we spent a while remaking the template for that one.

Lenny (00:46:45):
I love that ritual. You actually wrote even in more depth in the post that we worked together on how Coda builds product, which we'll link to if folks want to try this out and you link to actual templates people can actually use it their companies. When someone's listening to this and they're like, "Oh, wow, this is extremely cool," how easy is it do you find for people to take a ritual from a company and implement it? How much is cultural and it's hard to transplant, or do you find people can take this Catalyst idea plug and play at a lot of companies?

Lane Shackleton (00:47:15):
Yeah. I think it depends a lot on what your role in the company is. Maybe to say the extremes for a second, if you're a brand new PM to an organization, you probably shouldn't go try to remake the whole product review cycle that the head of product is really passionate about and has crafted. But you can probably take a decision template or some interesting ritual that has facilitated a team in the past and use it with your team. Another one of my favorites there is a hundred dollar voting. We use that a lot in the context of planning, and I find that creative rituals like that are easy to pick up for teams because oftentimes it's like, okay ... And maybe I'll describe the ritual real quick.

Lenny (00:48:01):
Yeah. I was going to ask.

Lane Shackleton (00:48:02):
The ritual is essentially you can take any set of problems or solutions or themes or whatever you want to get people's input on, and you put those into a table and then people can basically vote with their dollars and usually you allocate $100. And so people will go through and say, "Oh, I want to allocate $10 to this and $20 to this and $50 to this because I think it's really important." And I have found that especially in planning processes, little rituals like this are great at getting the elephant in the room out. So it's like, "Oh wow, we have a huge spread on this one particular problem. You think it's a huge problem. I don't think it's a problem at all. Let's talk about it." Going back to the thesis of turning ambiguity into clarity, a lot of this is like we're trying to get the ambiguous stuff out there so that we can make it more clear.

(00:49:03):
And so I use that as an example because you can be a brand new PM, run a brainstorm, run a planning session like that, and you're probably going to get great feedback. People are probably going to go, "This is cool. I've never done this before." Now to go to the other side of the spectrum, we help a lot of companies that want to remake a whole process. They want to remake a review system like Catalyst or they want to remake their decision rituals. And so in that sense, we're usually talking to a head of product or director of product or VP of product and someone who tends to have a lot more agency over the way that the team works.

Lenny (00:49:48):
Coda is interesting in that it feels like you have pretty stable processes for planning and reviews. I find most companies just every six months rethink a lot of these things. I guess that's probably a sign that you found something that's really good and works and you don't have to redo it. How much are you radically changing the way you operate versus working in similar ways? How do you think about that percentage wise?

Lane Shackleton (00:50:11):
People are always coming up with new creative ways to make their teams run better, make decisions go smoother. And we're continuously adopting those, but there's definitely a backbone of the system. The backbone of the system is Catalyst and tag-ups and the concept called Bullpen. And then there'll be a lot of iteration on top of that. And even those systems went through a lot of iteration. I talked about how the calendar hold got removed and then individual topics got added. That took us launching automations and the ability to add things to calendar in order for that whole process to really work. So in the years prior to us launching that, we did it very manually. So I think there's still a lot of creativity that I see every day.

(00:51:06):
So I'll give one quick example. One of our PM leads on core product, this guy Nathan, he basically saw that a lot of decisions had a lot of different stakeholders because he's in the core product. And now he's leading the core product team so he's trying to figure out what guidance do I give to each of these PMs on who to involve in these decisions? Because every one of these with core product feels like they impact everybody. And so a very simple thing that he did probably in the last six months was he had a table of all the upcoming decisions and then at a tag-up ... Which I can explain if you want. But basically with a small set of stakeholders, he had all the upcoming decisions and then he let people hit a little reaction and say, "Oh, I don't need to be involved. Just notify me of the decision after." Or, "Hey, I have some opinions, but you can keep going." Or, "No, I really want to be heavily involved in this decision."

(00:52:10):
And it was such a pro move. It was such a, I've been through a million of these. I don't want to treat every one of them the same because if I do, it's going to slow down the velocity of this whole organization. And so instead, the majority of those, Shishir or I or Oliver, the head of engineering will say, "I may have some opinions, but keep going." That's often the default. And then there are plenty where we say, "Just notify us of the decision after." And in doing that, Nathan can now give better guidance to the PMs on his team and say, "Hey, you don't really need to involve as wide a group as you think, so just keep going and check in later." So I think those types of little iterations are usually based on a really good insight.

Lenny (00:53:02):
It sounds like a dream come true for a platform team to reduce how many people have to be involved in all your planning and decision making. And that process in which you call it tag-up, maybe just briefly explain it and then I want to talk about this handbook you're working on, which is going to I think, cover a lot of these things.

Lane Shackleton (00:53:17):
Tag-up is based on this insight that a lot of work and project work tends to get discussed in one-on-ones. And actually it's really an anti-pattern. It's a pattern you should try to avoid. So if you're talking to your manager about product work, what's not happening in that moment is your eng lead and your design lead, they're not hearing that. And so you end up with this big game of telephone where you'll have a conversation with your manager in a one-on-one, they'll go back and translate to their engineering and design lead, and of course the fidelity of the game of telephone, something is lost in all of those transmissions. And so the core idea is have a group one-on-one with the key stakeholders. And so we have this concept of braintrust that's modeled off after Pixar's braintrust.

(00:54:11):
And so we'll have a tag-up with a small set of people from a given team, or sometimes we have larger groups, and then they meet with their braintrust and it's once a week. It's the same mindset of a one-on-one. It's their time. So anything that they need to unblock a decision or to make progress, they should use that time for. And they often start by reviewing OKRs and metrics and things like that. But then we generally get into a table of topics. Anyone can add a topic. Those topics are up voted, so people will react and then the table will sort itself. And then we'll say, "Okay, this is clearly the topic on people's mind." And that's a version of what we call Dory, which I can talk about. But essentially the principle is you should discuss that project work with the whole group there. With the whole triad there. And oftentimes with the sales person there and with the marketer there and with everybody else. So I found that that is just a really good practice to try to move a lot of that work out of one-on-ones and into a small group setting.

Lenny (00:55:26):
Awesome. Okay. So you're working on a handbook that's collecting a lot of these rituals. Talk about that and then when can people maybe look for it?

Lane Shackleton (00:55:36):
One of the realizations I had the other day, probably a month or two ago when we started working on this thing, was I was talking to someone about Catalyst and a couple other concepts, and they were like, "I get it. I'm sold. I want to implement some of these things. Where do I look?" And so I found myself sending them a bunch of links to individual templates. So that cued us into the fact that we needed to have a better core handbook for teams that wanted to adopt some of these rituals and also learn from all the rituals that we have learned from and feel very fortunate to have partnered with so many customers on. And so what we did was started writing this handbook, and it's going to come out hopefully by the time this recording is done. And in it, we'll talk about everything from rituals like Catalyst to decision rituals to a lot of planning and strategy and roadmaps, that kind of stuff. And trying to pull out the most interesting patterns and also give people a pretty practical view of how to implement these things. I think that's what has been lacking sometimes.

Lenny (00:56:50):
Amazing. We'll definitely link to that. Hopefully it's live by the time goes out. We'll make it happen. I know also you said Shishir's working on a book that's related and basically rituals of great teams and Shishir was on the podcast and he talked about Dory, so we don't have to get into that. If people want to learn about Dory, they can watch that episode. It was one of the earliest episodes actually. One of the most popular.

Lane Shackleton (00:57:09):
Yeah. I remember that.

Lenny (00:57:11):
Okay. Cool. I have a bunch of random questions now. I'm just going to go in a few different directions. One is, you wrote this post that you call Learn by Making, Not Talking. Is that another principle by the way? Is that amongst your many principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:11):
Yes.

Lenny (00:57:24):
Okay. Awesome. So in that post, which we'll link to, you share this story of how you and the YouTube team came up with skippable ads, which I didn't realize it was such a controversial ... But in thinking about it, obviously letting people skip ads, I could see why people were not excited about that. Could you just tell that story? And basically it's like the story of how skippable ads on YouTube came about?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:46):
Yeah. So I moved over to YouTube shortly after the acquisition. It was an amazing tight-knit team. It definitely felt like the Wild West. We were getting sued by Viacom for a billion dollars when that was a lot of money. No advertiser wanted to talk to us. It was essentially viewed as a site of cat videos and dogs on skateboards and things like that. And then I guess the other context, the sales team was very nascent and all they wanted to sell was the homepage and for good reason. That was where you made your money as a salesperson. And so I had just been sponsored by Salar and Shishir to become a PM. It's a longer story that I'll leave out for now and we can go into. But on day one of being a PM, Shishir's like, "Great. You're the new guy. You get the project that nobody else wants and that's called skippable ads. And we've got this crazy idea that we can align the incentives of advertisers and viewers and creatives in this really clever way by putting a skip button on the ad and then charging people per views." And the latter part we hadn't quite cemented yet, but it was part of the core idea.

(00:59:04):
And so the thing I write about in this post is as a new PM, this feels like a really consequential decision. It's like we've got this new product idea. Nobody really wants it. Advertisers don't want it. The sales team doesn't want it. And it's a very unproven thesis. And so the thing I write about is these are the types of things that you can debate for months or years. And I was sitting in a one-on-one with this guy named Phil Farhi who's an amazing product leader and was my boss at the time. And we're trying to figure out what to do and how to handle all the different dynamics. And he just stops and he's like, "You know what? Just test the extremes. Start the experiment tomorrow. We'll figure it out." Essentially.

(00:59:49):
And I think his point was like, look, we can debate this forever. So I would rather us see the upper and lower bounds of how good this could be or how bad this is going to be immediately. And so we launched a set of experiments. This guy Jamie Kerns who's still there. Tiny little skip button on one experiment, giant skip button that covered the entire player on the other side of the experiment. And within a few weeks, I think we had developed some conviction based on some very directional data that we were onto something. And so the lesson that I took, this is many years ago and I've seen this proven out hundreds of times since, is stop talking about it and go make something. Go run an experiment. Go make a prototype, go write a doc, go make a mock. Just don't talk about it.

(01:00:49):
And I found that also as a leader, people really follow that concept. And I also found that it transcends level. I am not talking just to ICPMs. I'm talking to heads of product and CPOs and CEOs to some degree. You should always be out there trying to learn by expressing your ideas and putting them out there. And that's much more valuable in many cases than pontificating about it or having endless circular discussions on it.

Lenny (01:01:23):
It makes me think a little bit about Twitter where they spent years just thinking about the edit button or all these different changes. They're so scared, they did so much research and then now they're changing things left and right. Everything's fine. Everyone's still using it. It shows you that you don't have to be so delicate.

Lane Shackleton (01:01:39):
Yes. It's almost never as bad as you think it's going to be. So yeah, it's just a question of how much better it can be oftentimes.

Lenny (01:01:46):
You mentioned in your early career ... We talked about your Alaska guide phase. Something else I saw is that you were on the AdWords approval team. You basically were reviewing ads people submitted to run on AdWords and that's how you started in tech. So I guess first of all, is that true? And then second of all, how did you graduate from that phase and become this Chief Product Officer of one of the fastest growing, most interesting companies in the world?

Lane Shackleton (01:02:13):
That was a really memorable time. There's an amazing cohort of people that started in tech. I think there was 200 or 300 of us at that time and then eventually thousands that started in Sheryl Sandberg's organization. I guess maybe some quick context. Before running ads on google.com at that time, you had to have them manually approved by a human before that was handled by machine learning and outsourced to other countries. And so there was this process where basically an ad would show up on your screen, you would mark it family safe, non-family safe, porn. And then based on that, it would either run or it wouldn't. And actually, funny enough, some of my most successful friends were terrible at the approval event. They failed the rote task of approving ads. They just couldn't handle it and they went on to be really, really successful.

(01:03:08):
So after working on ad approvals, at that time, I moved to chat support. It was basically when AdWords was launching chat support. I remember very fondly having two chats, chatting with two advertisers at once. Moved on to phone support. That was eight hours a day of talking to AdWords customers. Really a total rollercoaster ride. It was basically one minute you would pick up the phone and it would be someone from a Fortune 100 company trying to spend millions of dollars on AdWords and then the next minute you would be on the phone with a psychic or a taxi driver that was warring with their compatriots over some really specific keyword. I think there were two lessons that I would draw from this. One is I had a mentor at the time and his advice when I was starting my career was basically you have to get customer facing from the very beginning because you're going to end up serving a customer your whole career. Even when you're the CEO of a company, you're going to be serving a customer. So you better get really good at being in any customer scenario and being able to handle it. And so I think that that turned out to be insanely good advice. And if I think about a piece of advice that I give out to people who are early in their career, I've definitely recycled that advice.

(01:04:29):
I think the other thing that I took away from that experience was it's just a great lesson in when people don't actually care about your product. So in AdWord's case, people did not care about AdWords. You were the expert on it and you're trying to tell them about ad groups and how this ad format works and blah, blah. And most of the time people are like, "Dude, I'm a small business owner. I'm trying to get people to come to my auto mechanic store." Or, "I'm trying to get people to come to my taxi service," or whatever it was. I don't care. Basically the product had to get out of the way and really just drive impact for the customer. It was like they just want more phone calls or they want more people in the store. So those are I think two pieces that I think about from those days still.

(01:05:21):
And then I worked in a variety of other roles. I worked in a role called product specialist, which is an awesome role back when there were 15 product specialists at Google. For me, that was an amazing time because I was getting to sit on seven or eight different core product teams. And in my observation, these days, most PMs don't get to sit on other people's core teams. And so I had these three or four years of just ... I call it a masterclass in PMing because I was getting to watch what was working for some PMs and what wasn't working for other PMs and just taking notes behind the scenes. So that was a really influential role. And then went on to various PM roles at Google and YouTube.

Lenny (01:06:09):
Coming back to noticing. It comes up again and again in our chat. This is so interesting because it feels like you basically came from the mail room of tech to the top of the product field. And so I think there's a lot of inspiration people can take from this journey. One quick question is how long was that journey from not being a PM, from I guess being at a tech company to getting your first PM role? Just to give people a sense.

Lane Shackleton (01:06:33):
Let's see. I probably worked for at least four, five years before being able to move to PM and I think that was a slightly harrowing journey because at the time, you had to have a computer science degree.

Lenny (01:06:46):
At Google. Right. Cool. So I think that's one takeaway too is give it time. It's not going to happen. There's a lot of people that are just like, "I need to become a PM immediately."

Lane Shackleton (01:06:55):
Totally.

Lenny (01:06:56):
I think that's a good example of it's not going to happen overnight. Coming back to your two lessons, I think they're really interesting and I'm curious if there's anything else that comes to mind of what you found was essential to you succeeding in this path? So the first lesson you shared as being customer facing. And in this case being in retail as customer facing, is your advice get in a tech company and work on something customers use or is even working at Starbucks or Abercrombie, does that count?

Lane Shackleton (01:07:24):
Yeah. I think maybe to relate it to what you just said, if I were to give advice to someone who really aspires to be a PM or trying to get into PM, I think in many cases if you're in a customer facing role, you are the expert on the customer and that is really, really valuable in tech organizations. And oftentimes it's undervalued. And so I think people who want to move into PM roles who are not currently in PM roles can often lever that experience and that knowledge of the customer in ways that are pretty profound for the organization and pretty insightful for the organization if they really are creative about it. And then I think the other thing is, regardless of where you are in the organization, you're always serving a customer. You can't just talk to one big enterprise customer and you can't just talk to the smallest customer. You have to have a diverse and continuous stream of customer interactions in order to have good intuitions about what to do next. And your engineers aren't going to really trust you unless you have good intuitions about where the customer's headed and what they want and stuff like that. And so the stakes I think are pretty high. The good news is it's easier than ever with all these tools to really get into the mindset of a customer.

Lenny (01:08:47):
My lesson touches on something a previous guest talked about, Paige Costello, where she was often the youngest person in the room and built a lot of respect and people really trusted her over time. And her lesson was know thy customer. If you know the most about what they need, and you can show, here's what I've heard again and again and again, people will just like, "Oh Lane, tell us more." And they bring you into conversation because providing value, you're not just there sharing opinions. Everyone's got opinions.

Lane Shackleton (01:09:15):
That's basically how both me and ... I had a friend named Bill Ferrell who transitioned into PM at the same time and that's essentially how we got the try at being a PM inside of Google was we knew the customer really, really well and we were often in conversations bridging the gap from here's what I think they're really saying, or here's what I think we should build based on what they said.

Lenny (01:09:41):
The other thing I wanted to mention, you talked about the product and how a lot of customers don't care about the product, they just care about just I need this thing done. It reminds me at Airbnb, we hired this guy, Chip Connolly, who was a hotelier. He created the Joie de Vivre hotel chain and just is steeped in hospitality. And he came to Airbnb and started doing this worldwide tour talking to hosts. And he's just like, "Guys, when you talk about product, you're telling hosts, 'Hey, the product's going to be updated. We're going to launch all these features.', they think their home is the product of Airbnb. They don't understand what you're talking about when you're talking about the online experience and the website. That's the last thing they think about. It's the experience of someone traveling on Airbnb and staying in their home." So I think it's a really good reminder of most people don't care about the product. They just have this problem and you just happen to be this website that'll help them solve it.

Lane Shackleton (01:10:30):
I think most people can be way more concise with their communication. Even internally, people don't care. You should assume that people don't care. Or if you're talking to customers, writing a blog post for customers, you should assume that they don't care. When you start with that assumption, you really force yourself to be a little bit sharper in your communication style.

Lenny (01:10:53):
And one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I heard a story that at Coda there's this moment called Tim Ferriss Day that drove a lot of traffic. Can you share that story? Does that ring a bell?

Lane Shackleton (01:11:08):
Yeah. There's lots of memorable days at Coda. One of them was Tim Ferris Day. So I guess maybe for context, we had built this very nascent publisher motion where we were going out and helping people publish their rituals. And this is what you see in the Coda Gallery and a lot of what we talked about today. But we had this one person on that team, this guy Al Chen, Tim Ferriss fan, and also I think had been really tenacious with the people around Tim Ferriss and basically finally got an in to him and figured out a really neat way to implement one of his rituals and wrote a doc. And so none of us really knew this, but this was all happening. And anyway, we wake up one morning and traffic is just spiking through the roof, signups are spiking, no one knows what's going on.

(01:11:59):
I'm convinced this is all spam. I'm like, "Something's wrong with our data or something's going haywire." At the time, we were also in the China Basin office and the fire alarm went off. And so now we're outside on our laptops. We were in a war room trying to figure out what was happening and now we're outside trying to figure out what's going on. So anyway, make a long story short, data scientists investigate and we eventually figured out that we had been featured in Tim Ferriss' email newsletter and I think early on you hear this lesson or this adage of first time founder, build a great product, second time founder, build a great distribution. I think that was one of those early big cues to think about the importance of content distribution and the importance of these publishing flywheels. And it definitely made us double down. We're like, "Okay, if we can do this with Tim Ferriss, what's next?" And we definitely spent a few months trying to reach that high watermark that was set that day in traffic and sign-ups. So it was a fun memorable day and people for the subsequent one or two years would refer to it as Tim Ferriss Day.

Lenny (01:13:15):
So funny. I bet Tim Ferriss had no idea what he did.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:18):
No idea.

Lenny (01:13:19):
Hoping you have a Lenny's podcast day once this comes out. Everyone's going to be freaking out. What is going on here? Is there anything else you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lane Shackleton (01:13:30):
Maybe we're talking really briefly about two-way writeups.

Lenny (01:13:33):
Yeah, let's do it. I had that in my notes, but I skipped it, so I'm glad you mentioned it.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:37):
Cool. Yeah, I mean this is a concept that I wrote a bunch about and I often now get asked about, and I guess maybe the historical view of this, I got really obsessed with the history of how work gets discussed and decided upon and broke it down into three phases. And so the first phase was 1980s we had PowerPoint. It was this amazing tool. You could manipulate shapes on a screen and we were all using fancy clip art and it was really fun, but we've all had the experience of being in a really long PowerPoint presentation and someone's droning on in their slides and stuff like that. Second phase is in the early 2000s, two things converged. One was Google bought this company called Rightly that became Google Docs. So instead of having Word on your desktop and sending files around you now had online collaborative editing.

(01:14:35):
And the other thing was Jeff Bezos sent this very famous memo, which basically said no more PowerPoint at Amazon. And what that did was started in earnest their six pager ritual. You can read all about this in the book Working Backwards. It's a really good book. Colin Breyer's book. And so that started I think what I'll call the one-way writeup phase, which is you're writing down your ideas, you're expressing them clearly. It's in prose so you have to be really clear. That was a big step up I think from always presenting work and deciding on work via presentations. And then the thesis is that we're in the midst of a new phase, which is essentially two-way writeups and that's where it's more conversational and feedback and discussion is actually part of the content itself. So that's the broader historical arc. But if you think about it, PMs and product people are always at the brunt.

(01:15:31):
They feel this the most because they're the ones that are driving decisions and really the ones that are driving discussions oftentimes in companies. And so I think the problem with one-way writeups I felt very deeply at Google and YouTube. And just to name them, the first one is you would always be trying to figure out who's read your write-up. So I have many memories of sending a write-up out at 11:30 PM and then waiting patiently for the avatar of the SVP in my area to show up in there. And that was a sign that they had read it, which is just totally insane if you think about that behavior. The second one is you end up having a lot of the discussion in the comments itself. So this is a space that's really built for grammar and spell checking and things like that. And you're having these really meaningful discussions in this a hundred pixel right margin.

(01:16:30):
And part of that I think is there are all these questions that are being raised, and so you have really no idea what the most important question is. And so if you're facilitating those discussions in one way writeups, you're often going through the comments in the 20 minutes before that session trying to figure out which one of these do I want to address. And then the other behavior, and I don't know if you've ever seen this in a doc, but in one way writeups that you see a lot is there'll be just a mega comment thread on the title of the doc. And people are like, "I don't think we should do this," or you'll get into this 30 comment thread on the title because that's the best place to put your overall thoughts. And I saw this pattern all the time. So if you live that life, I think the world of two-way writeups and the way that I think a lot of our customers are doing it, and you can do this on other tools besides Coda too, I think is quite a bit better.

(01:17:26):
I guess the alternative to go down that list is you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup. So now you can say, oh, these are all the people that have read this. And I think even you see a pattern in some of our customers where if it's a particularly long writeup, you'll have three done reading buttons so you can see where everyone has gotten to. And then the second thing is making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question. So instead of pulling questions out of the comments and trying to figure out which one to address, just putting those in a table and then letting people upload those. And that's what we call Dory. And then I think probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?

(01:18:13):
And if you think about the contrast between a comment thread on the title and seeing a list of all the sentiment, how everybody feels about this proposal and really being inclusive to the entire audience is just wildly different. I think in my particular experience. I'll give you one example. I wrote this proposal, this is now a couple years ago. I thought it was going to sail through no problem. I thought it was going to get four out of five and five out of five smiley faces from everybody. That's sort of how the sentiment table works. And one of the lead designers basically said, "One smiley face. We shouldn't do this." And I was like, oh man. This particular person's not really vocal in meetings. And so I would not have heard that feedback. It was very unlikely I would've heard that feedback unless they had had a sentiment table, a place to add that. And so I think the punchline on all of this is I really authentically believe that this is where we're headed and hope that a lot of PMs and product teams adopt this in general.

Lenny (01:19:23):
I'm so glad that we touched on it and there's a template or an explanation of this that you wrote up that we'll link to. Yeah.

Lane Shackleton (01:19:31):
Great. Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:32):
Awesome. Is there anything else that you think that we should touch on that we haven't touched on?

Lane Shackleton (01:19:37):
Yeah. I think one thing that we've discussed before is just about strategy and planning and stuff like that. So it may be useful to touch on a couple of insights there. I think there's two insights in the strategy and planning thing. And this is again in the handbook that we're writing, but the first that I end up seeing a lot is just this idea that OKRs are not actually strategy. So I think the way that we plan and the way that our customers plan, the key point is it's critical to disconnect strategy discussions from OKR discussions. And it sounds really obvious, but it's I think a very common mistake. And I think a really simple question to ask yourself is do we have a separate strategy process or strategy ritual that is distinct from OKR setting and metric setting and goal setting? And I have found you can pick whatever strategy framework works for you, but I do think it's quite important to pull those two things apart.

(01:20:43):
The other rule that we live by on the planning side is what we call a 10% planning rule, which is essentially just ensure that you're not for a given time period planning for more than 10% of that execution period. And I think this is a really easy mistake to make. I mean, this is a hard fought rule because we've made that mistake before. But you end up getting bogged down in planning or saying, planning felt rushed and so we need to make it three weeks instead of one week or whatever. And the byproduct of that over the course of a lot of time is that you end up just planning way too much and oftentimes you really don't know what's ahead until you've launched or learned something. And so I think that's a pretty good rule to follow.

Lenny (01:21:32):
I love that rule. I found the same heuristic. 10%. If you're planning for a week, plan for half a day, planning for a month, maybe like three days. Yeah, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:46):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:21:47):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:51):
One that comes to mind is Turning the Flywheel. It's a little manuscript book. Jim Collins wrote it. It's really, I think a very succinct and very fast read about how flywheels work. We talked about Storyworthy. I recommend that book a lot. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy. Love that book. Very simple framework that I've reused a bunch. Maybe outside of tech, Waking Up is a book by Sam Harris on mindfulness that I really like. And then an old one that I really like is The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galway, which is a kind of classic.

Lenny (01:22:27):
Amazing. On Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, I'm working on getting Richard Rumelt on the podcast. I'm in talks with his agent and they seem to be excited. So we'll hope that actually happens. And then you inspired me to try to get the Storyworthy guy on. So what a cast of characters we're going to get on here.

(01:22:43):
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Lane Shackleton (01:22:48):
Yeah, it's a little bit hard with three kids and a job these days to watch a lot of TV. I would say I really enjoyed The Last Dance. I love any sports documentary. All those.

Lenny (01:22:59):
Have you seen Underrated, Steph Curry's new documentary?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:01):
No, I haven't. I got to watch that.

Lenny (01:23:03):
Ooh. It's really good.

Lane Shackleton (01:23:05):
I've been rewatching Arrested Development. That's also just a timeless classic.

Lenny (01:23:11):
Classic. I love that Michael Cera is in the Barbie movie, not to give any spoilers. That was a funny surprise.

(01:23:18):
Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:22):
There's two I really like. One is teach me something that I don't already know. I think it's just an awesome way of seeing if someone's going to lean in and really figure out what you don't know and then how passionate they are about pitching what they do know I think is really fun. And then Shishir and I have been asking a version of teleporter question and evolving it for many years now, so I like that question quite a bit.

Lenny (01:23:49):
Shishir shared that question in his episode and we make TikTok clips out of some of these conversations and that clip just went crazy. People love it. It's our most viewed clip, I think on TikTok. Or just like, what would your answer to that question, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes if you want to watch just that one interview question. I think you maybe gave it away, so maybe that's why you're evolving it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:10):
Yeah. We-

Lenny (01:24:11):
Don't know if we screwed you.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:13):
I also recently wrote a post about my favorite ref check question, which I think I would love to learn other people's favorite ref check questions.

Lenny (01:24:20):
References check. Oh man. That's its own. Oh man, I'd love to do a podcast just on that. That is such an important skill. The first question you mentioned of asking people to teach you something, I heard the best version of that in a previous episode where Maya, the Head of Product for Spotify podcasts, asks what would your podcast be if you were to start a podcast?

Lane Shackleton (01:24:40):
I like that.

Lenny (01:24:42):
So feel free to steal it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:45):
I sometimes do a version of making them explain it two different ways after, and making the candidate explain it two different ways and saying, "Okay, now you have to explain that to your grandparent." And then now you just told me about sewing or some hobby of yours. Now sell it in its most technical form to someone who knows everything about this particular topic. And so it's kind of fun to also see the range that people can operate.

Lenny (01:25:13):
Awesome. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? Either digital or physical, anything that comes to mind?

Lane Shackleton (01:25:21):
A few. I'm becoming a real sleep nerd, so those eye masks that cup around your eyes, I love. Obviously in the tech world, ChatGPT. I got really obsessed with tennis during the pandemic. There's a product called Swing Vision that's really good. It basically cuts up your match into different ... All of your forehands or all the longest rallies or all that and uses AI to do that. There's a corresponding meditation app to the book Waking Up that I really like. That one's a very good one.

Lenny (01:25:57):
We live not so far from each other, so we got to play some tennis and I could check out this very cool product.

Lane Shackleton (01:26:01):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (01:26:03):
You're on. That'll be our sequel. Just our game. Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with people around you, share with your kids maybe?

Lane Shackleton (01:26:16):
I don't know if it's as motto as much as it's just a way of being. It's essentially the present moment is all that we have. Realizing that our attention is very often on the past or the future and in so many ways the present is where it should be always. And so I think that that is something I think about a lot. I think maybe more broadly, I had a mentor who roughly said a version of make things happen, and so I really try to apply that to anything that I do. If that's work or life or sports, I try to be the person who creates momentum and positive change and progress. And so I think that that's generally a good motto to live by.

Lenny (01:26:58):
Beautiful. What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:03):
My mom's a psychologist and a professional counselor so certainly active listening. Maybe the tech version of that or the modern version of that is steal manning someone's argument, being able to repeat back to someone what they said in a better form, more clear form. So yeah, she's an amazing woman. Taught me a lot about listening.

Lenny (01:27:28):
Final question. You were a guide in Alaska helping people climb. If someone were to pursue climbing, is there a tip or a lesson or something that you think people should know to get better at this or to know before they go down this route?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:43):
There's a saying, which is the safest climber is the one who knows when to come down essentially. And I think that there are many times that you have to put your ego in check and come off a mountain or come out of a climb because it's not quite as safe as you thought it was. So I think that's maybe one. I think the other is it's probably not a one-way door. So I think in many ways you can do climbing and you can do some of these outdoor pursuits on the side, or you can always come back from them. So it's maybe not as big of a choice as some people think it is.

Lenny (01:28:24):
Lane, I said at the top of this episode, Coda has one of the most thoughtful product teams out there, and I think it'll be clear to people after listening to this why that's the case and where it trickles down from. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and ask you any other questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lane Shackleton (01:28:42):
I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have a Substack. We'll be releasing that handbook for product teams that I will probably post on Substack. And in terms of useful to me, yeah, give Coda a try. Give us feedback. I love hearing from product people all over. It's one of the bright spots in my day to hear all the creative rituals that come from this community. You've created just a legendary community of people and so they always give very thoughtful feedback so I'm very open to all of that. And yeah, thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:29:22):
Awesome. Lane, thank you again so much for being here.

Lane Shackleton (01:29:25):
Thanks.

## Transcript

Laura Modi (00:00:00):
So our head of growth, who... I mean, this girl is just fabulous. She was watching our inventory levels very carefully and also watching how quickly we were growing. And I'll never forget that moment. I can visualize it, sitting in a meeting, and she pulls up her screen. She goes, "Here's the dilemma. We are depleting inventory far quicker than our ability to replenish and the customers keep coming." You sit there and your first reaction is "This is great. We're growing." And she's like, "It's not that great, actually, because here's what's going to happen. We are going to run out of product for the babies that are on Bobbie today. We have about six days before we get to a place where we won't be able to serve those who've already made a commitment to Bobbie." She's like, "So we need to turn off our site and stop growing the business."
Lenny (00:00:56):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Laura Modi. Laura and I actually worked together at Airbnb for many years where she was director of hospitality, leading all of the work around strengthening the host community and also improving marketplace quality. After leaving Airbnb, she went on to found a company called Bobbie, the only female-founded and mom-led organic infant formula company in the US which basically every mom I know uses.
(00:01:26):
I rarely have CEOs or founders on this podcast, and when I do, it's because I'm confident that product leaders and growth teams and other founders can learn a lot from this person. Laura is a great example of this and I've been incredibly impressed with watching Laura execute and build this company. In our conversation, we talk about how to build and maintain momentum within your organization, how sometimes slowing growth down is the best way to grow long term, why the most innovative ideas often come from people with no experience in the problem space, how to lead through tough times, why manufacturing fake deadlines is so powerful and effective and so much more. Laura is such a great leader and such a great human, and I'm really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Laura Modi, after a short word from our sponsors.

Today's episode is brought to you by Element. I just recently discovered the stuff actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And, unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. Element is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes.
(00:03:42):
Also, dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on Element to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines. You can try Element totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty.
(00:04:20):
Laura, welcome to the podcast.
Laura Modi (00:04:22):
Hi, I'm so happy to be here. It's a Friday, Lenny, this is amazing.
Lenny (00:04:26):
Oh, my God, already starting strong. I was looking forward to this chat for a few weeks already. I knew that we booked it a couple of weeks ago. Just as context, we worked together at Airbnb for a while and, not something I expected, but you went on to now become a magnate in the baby formula industry, which I'm excited to dig into. And so thank you again for being here.
Laura Modi (00:04:45):
Thank you. This is going to be exciting. Hope you don't mind. I am going to have a little bit of wine as we go through this.
Lenny (00:04:50):
It's highly encouraged. Maybe I need to start drinking more on the show. That might help.
Laura Modi (00:04:54):
Highly approved.
Lenny (00:04:56):
We'll see. We'll see how it ends up. It'll be a good retrospective.
Laura Modi (00:05:00):
Merlot's so good.
Lenny (00:05:00):
So I thought it'd be fun to start with just your time at Airbnb where we got to work together. You spent five and a half years there. Everyone that spends that amount of time at Airbnb, and let me know if you agree, always ends up being in this transformative time in their life and their career. Yeah, okay, you're nodding.
Laura Modi (00:05:15):
I can't imagine a world where I would be without Airbnb.
Lenny (00:05:21):
Yeah, I feel the same way. And so I want to spend a little time on what you learned from that experience and what you took away there. But just to start, can you just share briefly what you worked on while you were at Airbnb?
Laura Modi (00:05:28):
I mean, what didn't we work on? Just, I reflect back and it's one of those experiences where it probably was transformative because you do get an opportunity to work on so many different things. So I remember joining and I was just put in charge of leading and growing parts of customer service, vendor management. I mean, we were scaling the team so fast on that side. It quickly shifted into taking me to Europe where I led our consolidation of our European offices in Dublin. It was so funny. I remember at the time being asked to go do it and thinking, am I being asked purely because I'm just the only Irish person in the company right now? But it was one of the biggest operational changes that we went through there. And then for the last few years I was the director of hospitality leading global host community and host operations.
Lenny (00:06:22):
I think you're underselling that last part. Can you just share a little bit more of what that actually means?
Laura Modi (00:06:26):
Our product really wasn't our technology. It wasn't the technology that we were building, although for a few years we all thought it was. And then it got to a place where we realized Airbnb is nothing without its hosts, nothing. If anything, Airbnb's product was its hosts. So there was a moment, and I can't remember, it was two or three years in, where that narrative was building up more and more and we realized that there was a need to have a central team, which we called Hospitality, dedicated to equipping and recognizing and holding this product of our hosts accountable to their job.
Lenny (00:07:09):
Yeah, I think we could go down that. Maybe let me ask one question there because I think that's really interesting. For a company where the product, as you said, and marketplaces in general, the product you're selling is the supply, in our case Airbnb hosts. Is there something maybe you learned from that experience, I don't know, working at a software, company about how to think about the supply as the product and how that maybe informs, I don't know, what you're building today or just something in general?
Laura Modi (00:07:37):
I think it maybe just starts internally where you have to be able to create a culture first, to all understand that. Because otherwise you're going to be in a position where you're focused on optimizing the technology, efficiency, growth, looking at tools for tools' sake versus tools for users' sake. And I mean, I remember a very pivotal shift when we started realizing that we really needed to understand our hosts far more than we had leading up to that. And I think growth just follows. I mean, we certainly saw that at Airbnb. If we put the hosts first and we thought about building tools for them versus what do we need just to drive more bookings, users begets users, and that's exactly what we saw.
Lenny (00:08:29):
What are some lasting lessons from your time at Airbnb that you bring to what you're working on now?
Laura Modi (00:08:33):
The most obvious kind of cliched one is culture. It is bread and butter to everything you do, from the people you hire to how you build the right mindset to just keeping the energy. I mean, energy at Airbnb was the currency. It was like, unless you didn't have that energy, nothing was happening. And I think about that every day. How do you keep energy going? And my God, they did that for a decade, just keeping it going. I think the other big takeaway is if you can get people excited behind a vision and storytelling, it again kind of carries through that cross-functional work.
(00:09:16):
I now reflect back on just how powerful our storytelling was at Airbnb to get people pumped up. I mean, even for some of the smallest features that we would build, Lenny, they would kick off with the most powerful storytelling. I mean, we were changing lives. And again, it makes you wake up every day going, "Fuck, yeah, I want to work on this." And you're not just going in to fix something, you actually feel like you're having very large impact. And that has to be felt the whole way down the org.
Lenny (00:09:44):
I love that you're already getting into the specifics of what culture actually... how it manifests and how to build a culture. And so I want to maybe ask another question there. You talked about keeping the energy up is a big part of creating the culture. You want to create strong storytelling, either in one of those buckets or another example. What do you do at Bobbie, which we're going to talk about, to build a strong culture? What else do you do to actually do that? Because people hear about building a strong culture and they're like, "What do I do? How do I do that?" So I'd love to hear anything you've actually done there.
Laura Modi (00:10:11):
I think one of the biggest ones I would say is that you need to get to know people personally as much as you do professionally. And that was maybe something I also maybe took a little bit for granted at Airbnb. We had built a culture where people really personally loved each other. They loved working together. Now, fast-forward to today and you're building a company that's completely remote, how do you build a personal relationship?
(00:10:36):
For example, we make sure that we take time to have personal and professional check-ins. And cross-functional people in the org who maybe have no idea someone else as a kid or what they're doing in their lives. Because those personal connections, I mean, again, it's your second family, you're waking up every day to spend time with them. I think those personal connections are some of the biggest.
Lenny (00:10:56):
It's interesting because there's also this movement away from your workmates or your family. Airbnb I think is very... Everyone called themselves AirFam, but that becomes challenging when you have to let people go and there's challenging times. So is your perspective, that's where you find value, to kind of stay close to that?
Laura Modi (00:11:14):
I think you need a hybrid. I do. I think looking at work for transactions' sake, are your colleagues purely as the people who are just there to get the job done with you? That's not inspiring. No. Do I think that there's a balance and maybe some of the things that get introduced in a culture probably don't need to go that far? Yeah. But no matter what, I do believe building personal connections and actually caring about the people you work for is imperative for building a lasting business.
Lenny (00:11:45):
What's the story of going from Airbnb to building a baby formula?
Laura Modi (00:11:48):
Oh, my god. You mean leaving one of the fastest growing companies to start powdered milk? It was so funny. I don't know if I ever shared this with you, Lenny. I remember telling my dad and he was like, "Hold on a second, Laura. I don't understand." He's like, "You're lactose intolerant. Why are you starting a milk company?" He just couldn't fathom why I would, I mean in many ways, leave an established business that had established parental leave benefits, everything that in many ways, as you grow through your career, become more and more what you need and you need the stability.
(00:12:30):
So that shift, I suppose, just socializing it is probably one of the hardest. And it's a big thing to take a risk because you're taking 10 steps backwards in hopes of making major leaps forward. And I think that's just always kind of been a narrative mostly in my career, which is I don't believe there's such a thing as taking a big leap without first taking a major risk, and that was. I mean, it was a very big risk, obviously. But then also, keep in mind, even before I joined Airbnb, I had a good job at Google. And Airbnb at the time, I think, just had one of its most major crises back in 2011.
Lenny (00:13:09):
CJ or EJ?
Laura Modi (00:13:11):
EJ. EJ incident. It was all over the papers. It was a small company. I wasn't really given a title. And I'll never forget as well, exactly the same narrative. My parents going, "Hold on a second. You're leaving Google to go start a B&B." Like, "No, I'm not starting a B&B. I really believe this company's going somewhere." So anyway, the moral of the story is the move into starting my own business, it was a big risk and it was one that I felt so confident on that was needed, it was worth it.
Lenny (00:13:41):
Some people do what you did there, where you take a big risk and kind of maybe stick backwards and it doesn't work out. And in your case it's worked out many times. Is there a thread across the decisions you've made that you think people maybe should look for or you think is important in taking that big risk? Or do you think it was a lot of super luck?
Laura Modi (00:14:02):
Super luck. I mean, I have a folder of businesses and product ideas that, prior to Bobbie, I had dreamt of. And we can always get into that again in the future. Some of them I still dream of doing one day, but a big reason for not taking the risk is because I didn't feel the conviction. So, yes, while I think it's luck, I think I put a lot of intention into researching the marketplace, understanding the business, determining how much of a risk I'm really able to take, even financially. Sitting with my husband and determining how long I may need to be in this position before raising capital and is it possible? It certainly isn't what sometimes it can appear on the surface, which is, "Oh, she had an idea and she left." There's a lot of work that goes into determining is this actually going to be something that's viable?
Lenny (00:14:57):
I like that lesson. It may seem like Laura went to here, to Airbnb and was just like, "Oh, how lucky she picked Airbnb of all the companies." But what you're saying is you spent the time researching, seeing what the company started.
Laura Modi (00:15:09):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:15:10):
Yeah. Okay. So let's talk about Bobbie, just broadly. Can you just talk about what is Bobbie and then what is the scale of Bobbie these days? What stats can you share to give people a sense of how large this has gotten?
Laura Modi (00:15:20):
Bobbie is a powdered milk company. We are an infant formula. And prior to infant formula, the formula-gate of 2022, which everyone is now familiar with. The short of it is that this is an industry that is owned by a duopoly. It's one of the last remaining industries in the CPG space that has seen any disruption or change in probably 40 years. And my desire was to create a formula that parents could feel proud of, an infant formula that felt modern and met where science is today. Because frankly, none of the infant formulas on the market really had caught up to where science has evolved to.
(00:16:00):
Now, obviously, I only experienced this as becoming a mother myself. I knew nothing about this at all. And then I pick up a can of formula and I read the back of the can and there's ingredients in there I would never feed myself. And I think the thing that really hit me, and this was more of the business investor side of me, I just hated the product and I couldn't understand why, as something that is used by so many, 83% of parents, why is it that I'm embarrassed about it? I feel guilty feeding my child this and it's also ugly. It's sitting on my counter every day and this isn't what I want to see.
(00:16:41):
I remember saying to my husband, "I feel like we have failed to breastfeed." And the alternative is that I need to give her a medical solution to survive, which it's milk. I should feel like I'm giving her food. But for whatever reason, society has set this up to make formula feel like you have failed. I mean, that was the impetus. I know you asked me, what is Bobbie? We are a better-for-you infant formula without the guilt.
Lenny (00:17:12):
Ooh, I like that. That was a good summary at the end. How about about the scale of Bobbie? What kind of numbers can you share? Just to give people a sense of how large this has become.
Laura Modi (00:17:20):
Yeah. Oh, my god. I remember launching, it was 100% direct-to-consumer, it was at the top of 2021. And the moment you're about to launch, the first question all investors ask is what do you believe your growth is going to be? First question. It's the same question you get after you're married, when are you going to have a baby? I'm like, "I have no clue what my growth is going to be. I've been on the market for a hot minute." I remember thinking hopefully four million, five million in our first year. So the growth has been fabulous and beyond our wildest dreams in what we had expected.
Lenny (00:17:54):
Amazing. There's a bunch of questions I'm going to ask about how you grew Bobby, but you mentioned the COVID baby shortage crisis. And there's a couple stories I wanted to get into that was one of them. Can you just talk about what you went through in that period? Because I imagine it was both a blessing and a curse. Also, it reminds me, I have a friend who uses Bobbie and she just told me a story about how someone, she couldn't find any Bobbie during COVID, supply chain issues and all that, and an employee of Bobbie came to her house and brought her formula just to make sure she had enough. And obviously that created forever brand loyalty. And we'll talk a little bit about brand, but I'd love to hear about just that period of the journey and what you learned from it.
Laura Modi (00:18:34):
There is nothing like a crisis that gives you more of an appreciation for what opportunity lies ahead. And I would thank my blessings every day that the only way to look at this positively was to be in a position of gratitude that I have an opportunity that most startups would wait a lifetime for. So what happened was I woke up one day and the President of the United States was talking about there being an infant formula shortage. And again, it's just being in the right place at the right time. A topic that never has really been brought up. Unfortunately, one of the large companies, one of the duopolies, had a recall and that recall basically left the nation without product and we were not able to feed babies in the US.
(00:19:29):
Being one of the smallest companies here, we ended up seeing our customer count double the first week that that shortage happened. All of that would seem great, almost like a dream for any startup to be in, that you're going to see your product grow now because they're moving from one customer to another or from one product to another. But here's what happens. Infant formula is one of those products you can't run out of. It's not cool to be out of infant formula. It's not like a piece of furniture and you're at capacity for a certain amount of time.
(00:20:03):
So our Head of Growth who, I mean this girl is just fabulous. She was watching our inventory levels very carefully and also watching how quickly we were growing. And I'll never forget that moment. I can visualize it, sitting in a meeting. And she pulls up her screen, she goes, "Here's the dilemma. We are depleting inventory far quicker than our ability to replenish. And the customers keep coming." You sit there and your first reaction is, "I mean, this is great. We're growing." And she's like, "It's not that great, actually, because here's what's going to happen. We are going to run out a product for the babies that are on Bobbie today. That's a problem."
(00:20:48):
So in my absorption of everything that's happening, and again, being a company that had only been on the market 14 months, saying to her, "Well, Shireen, what do we do next?" And she's like, "We have about six days before we get to a place where we won't be able to serve those who've already made a commitment to Bobbie." She's like, "So we need to turn off our site and stop growing the business." That's a big decision to make when you're like, "Okay, so I'm going to turn to all of our investors and say we're turning off our site, we're closing down to ensure that we keep enough product."
(00:21:23):
But honestly, in hindsight, it was a no-brainer. We were not going to run out of product on our current subscribers and we had no idea how long the crisis was going to last. So even though we didn't know how long we'd be off, I gave the thumbs up, sally forth, turn it off, and we went into hibernation mode. And in many ways we switched immediately into our customers come first. We now have 70,000 subscribers who are in a place of panic because they hear the news every day that there's formula running out and our job is to give them confidence and clarity that we have the products for them and we're never going to run out. And we did. For six months, six months, we kept our website off and we didn't grow the business last year and we continued to serve our current subscribers and in the end we became the only formula company that was able to reliably serve its current customers and never run out.
Lenny (00:22:21):
That's an amazing story. I haven't heard that before. You threw out this term at some point when we were emailing earlier of slowth, you called it a slowth. Slow growth, I think.
Laura Modi (00:22:32):
Oh, my gosh.
Lenny (00:22:32):
Is that how you think about this?
Laura Modi (00:22:33):
That was part of also how do you change the culture internally? I had 60 people on the team who were all in a position of driving growth and many of them were probably only hired weeks before the shortage with the position of growth, email growth, paid acquisition. And all of a sudden you're telling someone who just left a cushy job to join a startup that we're no longer growing. And in fact, your job now is to completely flip what you thought you were going to do on its head. So we named the entire growth team, the slowth team.
Lenny (00:23:09):
That's awesome.
Laura Modi (00:23:09):
And I mean, they got creative. At some point we were emailing subscribers to nudge them to cancel because we were looking for a way to ensure that we could keep product, and my God, it was a mind-boggling moment.
Lenny (00:23:24):
What else did you learn from that period that has either stuck with you in this time and/or is there something maybe you think you would've done differently if you could go back?
Laura Modi (00:23:34):
Well, I have a personal belief of never looking back and regretting or changing things, but there were definitely some learnings and I would say on the positive end, some of the biggest learnings were just the power of storytelling and bringing the impact of what we were doing back into the company. I'm in a fortunate position as the CEO where, whether I'm speaking to advisors or on panels or engaging the outside world a lot more, I was able to truly feel, I mean, viscerally feel the impact that we were having by doing this.
(00:24:13):
I'll never forget, I was speaking at Davos on this topic and I had a customer. Oh my God, Lenny, this moment. I was standing outside of this events area and this woman comes running up to me and she's bawling, crying, and this is at a global leader's conference and she's crying and she just held my hands. And she's like, "Oh my God, you saved my life over the last year." She's like, "You have no idea the impact that Bobbie played in our lives by making the decision and giving me confidence that you weren't going to run out of product on us."
(00:24:53):
And that emotional connection of just, wow, yes, we may have grown the business faster, we may have gotten product back, but at the end of the day, these 70,000 voices that are out there and the stories that they have and bringing those back to the company, it's undeniable the impact, by making that decision, we've had. And I think the rest of the company feels it, too.
Lenny (00:25:16):
This connects with something we've brought up a couple of times now, which is just brand and brand building. Clearly, it's something that you've spent a lot of energy on and something you've done incredibly well. I think every mom I know knows of Bobbie. By the way, let me just throw this out there. I don't know if I've told you this, but I'm having a kid and we're going to get some Bobbie.
Laura Modi (00:25:34):
What?
Lenny (00:25:36):
Yep.
Laura Modi (00:25:37):
Oh my god, Lenny's going to be a dad. This is so exciting.
Lenny (00:25:42):
Oh man, this is going to be a whole new direction.
Laura Modi (00:25:44):
I've got your milk, if you need it, of course, if Michelle's in a position and she wants it, we're here for you.
Lenny (00:25:50):
Okay, I appreciate that. We're going to get a deal.
Laura Modi (00:25:53):
Oh, my God, I'm so excited for you.
Lenny (00:25:54):
Thank you. Laura, I feel like we need some formula just in case, right? Doesn't that-
Laura Modi (00:25:58):
You do. You do. And the rule is you have to try it, as well.
Lenny (00:26:02):
Oh, okay.
Laura Modi (00:26:03):
Yeah. If baby's going to try it, you need to give it a shot.
Lenny (00:26:06):
Okay. Okay, okay. Oh, I'll get ready for that. I like that rule. I like that rule. Okay. There's so many things to get used to.
Laura Modi (00:26:14):
We'll talk again.
Lenny (00:26:15):
Okay, so going back to my question about brand, basically I just want to understand what have you learned about building a brand and when do you think it is important to invest there?
Laura Modi (00:26:24):
I mean, it all depends on what your product is, but the first thing I've learned about it is you have to build a brand that connects with what your customers are going through, and the experience. I once had someone say to me, "Think about who your customer is and that one customer, the exact person, is going to wake up tomorrow morning and there's going to be three things that are just playing on them in the back of their mind, the things that keep them up at night. And if you are not solving for one of those, then you're going to be finding a way to build a brand and to get in the way of that, get in the way of their mindset, have them remember who you are or what you're about."
(00:27:06):
And it was very clear to us that everything, from who our brand was, what it stood for, the positioning, needed to be something that parents were really finding as a struggle in that first year in feeding. So you see it in our messaging, you see it in our creative. I have no desire to bombard people with something that isn't part of those top three things that they're experiencing. Otherwise, we will have companies out there and brands out there being loud for no reason. And I think that's continued to help us in every time we have to reframe or relaunch something, to keep remembering what do they care about, let's build a brand for them.
Lenny (00:27:48):
I really like that. That is such a good reminder of just, you are not going to convince someone they have a problem unless you're just spending endless money hammering into their head there's a new problem you have. If you connect to something they already know is a problem and just make it clear this is a solution to a problem, life gets a lot easier.
Laura Modi (00:28:06):
That's right.
Lenny (00:28:07):
Although I know that you also have to kind of fight this breastfeeding-is-best kind of thing. So in a sense you also have to convince people this isn't what you think it is.
Laura Modi (00:28:22):
Yeah. And then, what's the saying? If you're explaining, you're losing. And I think there's a part of this where there's going to be a large group of people that are always going to be in the mindset that breast is the only way to do it, and anyone who does otherwise is doing second best. And I'm not there to try and convince them. I think a part of this is amplifying those that are in need of our products, that are the 83% using formula and make sure that they feel heard. But that has been a learning. I mean, that's been a huge brand learning. How do you not lean into or amplify the voices that shouldn't be heard and in many ways just get distracted by it?
Lenny (00:29:03):
That's really interesting, and I don't know how much you want to talk about this, but I know initially the brand strategy was basically breast is not best. Formula is just as good. And what I'm hearing is you kind of realized you're not going to convince people of that and it's more lean into people that already understand.
Laura Modi (00:29:19):
Yeah. And I think another major belief I have is no brand, and I do fundamentally believe this, no brand should ever be in a position of pointing fingers to something that's better or worse. Our only job, and I wish politics would also do this, our only job is to talk about what we do and why we exist and why we believe our product is good. And I would say the flip is the same in formula. If a mother out there has access to another brand of formula that is more accessible, maybe more affordable, and it suits their baby, then good for them. And I should never be a company in a position pointing to a competitor or another way of feeding saying that it's worse off, ever.

(00:31:13):
Something else I heard about the way you operate is you, speaking of brand, is you brand internal things. Can you just talk about what that's all about?
Laura Modi (00:31:21):
Oh, my God. This is, I feel, like a secret sauce of just how to get it done half the time. And I really, really do believe the power of branding the mundane is so successful. I mean, we brand, to be fair, I actually feel like that this was a page out of the Airbnb book. Do you remember going back early days when we were doing customer service deep dives? What were the issues that customers were having? And we branded a program called Air Dives. Do you remember Air Dives?
Lenny (00:31:56):
Yeah.
Laura Modi (00:31:57):
And this program just became this thing where everyone wanted to know on a Friday what was the latest Air Dive. And really what an Air Dive was was an analysis of customer service tickets and customer service pain points. But how much better is Air Dive than a customer service analysis? So much better. So I think a lot of learnings on just the power of branding and storytelling your workflows and your frameworks and what it means to do your job, often keeps people motivated, too. And it creates memory recall a lot better, too. So now when you prefer Slack channels, they're all like, I don't even want to name them because I'm going to give you-
Lenny (00:32:43):
No, I was going to ask. I'd love some examples and I know they're going to sound ridiculous to an outsider, but what are some examples of things? And you can say like Bobbie Blank, or what's your naming convention?
Laura Modi (00:32:52):
Oh, my God. Project Shamrock. I'm not going to tell you what that's about. Project Lumberjack. Ooh, Got B 2022. I can give you so much insight into what these are and I'll give you an example of it. We have legal approvals that need to get made and these legal approvals on content claims have to happen. And I was like, okay, well how do we make sure everyone sticks to the quality SOP that legal wants set for all of the claims we have to have in place? So we created a program called the Secret Shopping Program, and our regulatory legal team go out and they do their own secret shopping once a month and then they report back on any misleading claims or ones that aren't fully understood that Bobbie needs to go back and update. But having a secret shopping meeting is very different to potentially coming in and listening to legal report out in your claims mishaps.
Lenny (00:33:59):
Speaking of legal mishaps and copy nuances, one of my favorite memories of you is I was in San Francisco on Divisadero outside, I think, The Mill, and you were just running by heading somewhere and we started chatting. You were heading, I believe, to the warehouse that you're manufacturing the early versions of Bobbie, and apparently the FDA showed up and shut you down because of some misleading communication in the news, as you're launching. I'd love to hear that story because I love it.
Laura Modi (00:34:26):
By the way, how you just transitioned from one example I just gave to that was absolutely exceptional, speaking of content mishaps.
Lenny (00:34:40):
I appreciate that.
Laura Modi (00:34:42):
This is why you're such a good podcast host, Lenny.
Lenny (00:34:44):
You're so kind.
Laura Modi (00:34:44):
You're so good.
Lenny (00:34:45):
Thank you, Laura.
Laura Modi (00:34:46):
Oh, my god, that moment. I do remember bumping into you. I was in an identity crisis. Yeah, early days. I think the one big learning I've had is that when you're in an industry where you are disrupting, I mean truly disrupting the status quo, you're going to be met with some reactions, people, or in our case government agencies who aren't happy about what you're doing. It was early days, we just launched a pilot and the FDA showed up at our warehouse and they didn't like the way that we were labeling the product. We had to pull all of our product from the market, we had to relabel everything and we had to work with the agency for another year before we could bring our products back. For startup world, that was a huge, I wouldn't even say it was a pivot, it was a patient pause, thinking sure that we could get back on track and build intentions with the FDA again.
Lenny (00:35:45):
Another example of slowth, maybe.
Laura Modi (00:35:47):
Another example of slowth, yes.
Lenny (00:35:49):
How did you personally stay motivated and keep morale up within the company during that period?
Laura Modi (00:35:55):
Well, I found out I was pregnant with my third child right after.
Lenny (00:35:59):
Super.
Laura Modi (00:36:01):
There's something about also growing your personal life while professionally it's happening. There's a little bit of give and take as well. So sometimes in moment of professional slowth, you might find that there's personal growth. That's exactly what I found. So I mean, yeah, during this journey I went on from being inspired by my first kid where I wasn't able to breastfeed and then had two more along the journey. And I don't know, I've actually never spoken about this, but I do think there's a beautiful marriage in that personal and professional growth that you can have and you kind of need to find moments where you lean into one and maybe the other. And then there's moments, like I kind of feel like I'm going through right now, where both of them are just on fire and you can't slow them down.
Lenny (00:36:44):
It might be a good time to chat about that. So you have this fast-growing business, you have three kids. Your partner is also a founder, also very busy. How do you manage all of these things?
Laura Modi (00:36:59):
That question is actually probably the most common question I get from new founders, those that are aspiring entrepreneurs, on just like how do you do it all? I mean, a lot of it's your infrastructure, it's your... Actually, hold on a second. I'm going to do something I don't think you've done on a podcast before. Hold on. This is my EA. I'm going to pull this woman in. Everyone just needs to say hi to Kendra. This woman.
Lenny (00:37:25):
Hi, Kendra.
Laura Modi (00:37:28):
I'm introducing her because the power of a support system to be able to do what you do, I mean, you are an extension, my leverage, my everything. And never leave.
Kendra (00:37:42):
I'm not going anywhere.
Laura Modi (00:37:43):
I'd be so screwed. And everyone should not only know the power and leverage of their person, but the level of appreciation and celebration you need to have for them is just huge.
Kendra (00:37:56):
I always feel celebrated, so thank you. I appreciate it.
Lenny (00:37:59):
How do people find a Kendra of their own? That's the million-dollar question.
Laura Modi (00:38:02):
Well, first, you don't take this one. This is a poach-free podcast.
Lenny (00:38:02):
Her name Lauren, not-
Laura Modi (00:38:10):
Yes, that's right.
Kendra (00:38:11):
We should have code names.
Laura Modi (00:38:12):
There's no last names here. How do you find your Kendra? I will say it took multiple interviews and it's all about chemistry. I think it's about chemistry and finding somebody that you genuinely care about. I genuinely care about you, your heart, your kids, your family, and I think finding that connection is really important.
Kendra (00:38:36):
Yeah.
Laura Modi (00:38:37):
Yeah. You know what's also funny, too, I think there's this feeling, and I would hear this from folks, how do you do it all? And I think we also just need to be very transparent. It takes a lot of work to do it all. I, as an operator, am very proud of the infrastructure I have built. I mean, we have calendars on our walls, we have calendars for our kids. We have back and forth birthday planning. It's additional help in the house. My nanny is the other extension in our house.
(00:39:10):
I mean, I don't know what we would do without Clifford. He is everything for us and I also have to see him as an extension to our parenting. But that is, I think, the only way to get through the chaos and the only way to embrace the all, is you actually need to put in the work to build the infrastructure, the systems, the frameworks, and then every month, or sometimes in our case on a weekly basis, me and my husband, we have a meeting every Sunday and it's walking through the agendas. Who's going to what TaeKwonDo classes this week? Or who's trading off on birthday parties or parent-teacher meetings. Because you're right, a dual CEO-founder household and three kids, it will age you fast if you don't have it.
Lenny (00:39:58):
It also makes me think a little bit about what you talked about earlier where, when things slow down a little bit in the business, there's an opportunity to lean into that part of life and then kind of get ahead on some stuff, in theory.
Laura Modi (00:40:09):
Totally, totally.
Lenny (00:40:11):
In terms of the business, I imagine you never started a D2C business before this. Also, you mentioned you've never formulated a baby formula prior to this. Clearly, it's working out. What's a lesson there of just doing something you've never done? Is that something you imagined is a good idea? Maybe looking back, maybe it doesn't matter. What have you learned about just this idea of doing something totally new and different?
Laura Modi (00:40:34):
I think one of the biggest beliefs is that an ounce of naivety will be your biggest secret to success. And I think the word even naivety sometimes gets a bad rap, but naivety is the definition of creativity and innovation and canvas and white space and opportunity. And I definitely went into starting this company with a level of naivety to how regulated it was, to the stigma associated with it, to how hard it would be. But that has allowed me to continue to look at the status quo differently.
(00:41:15):
I don't, because I don't fully understand it, and I have applied those same principles even into how I hire people because I do think... I'm now wondering who's going to watch this on my team, because obviously we have some specialists, but this is generalists who make the world go round. I think sometimes putting the most unlikely people who have an ounce of naivety to what it takes to win and succeed are the ones that are going to drive the biggest impact.
Lenny (00:41:45):
I love that. And it makes me think of a couple of things that I'll just share real quick. One is I was listening to an interview with Mr. Beast who is the number one YouTube creator on TikTok. I think he's got the biggest TikTok, and he talked about how he's got this business he's building, which is like a new way of creating content. And anytime he hires someone from a traditional Hollywood movie-making established kind of background, he's like, "They know what they're doing. They're going to help me legitimize this thing, make it scale." He's like, "Every time, they never work out. They just don't see what we're doing here. They don't understand how this is different and they just slow everything down." And he finds just finding really young, hungry, hardworking people that can learn and understand what he's done end up working a lot better.
Laura Modi (00:42:27):
Always.
Lenny (00:42:28):
The other interesting insight is I'm doing a series right now on B2B businesses and how the biggest B2B companies started and so far I'm finding 70% of the founders had no specific background or skill in the area. They went in to say it's security or sales or something like that. So there's a lot of examples of this.
Laura Modi (00:42:48):
I'll give you one example of someone who's in C who's just an absolute rockstar. Our girl who leads marketing is an Emmy Award news anchor. She's not your traditional marketer. She came in asking me to... She was like, "What does CAC mean? Do we need to look at this LTV number?" And the reason I wanted her in C was because she was the complete antithesis to what we would normally define as a good performance marketer. I wanted someone in C who got media, who got brand and storytelling, and she operates like a news anchor. And in many ways I would look to the team that she's built and think that we maybe have more of a media company than we do a marketing team. And that has been the fuel for the brand that you see today, 100%. And then you hire, unlike the people in those positions and especially senior positions, they're going to do exactly the same throughout the business as well.
Lenny (00:43:53):
That is really interesting. It makes me think of Airbnb a bit. Also, the browser company. We had the founder of that company on here and they have a storytelling team within their company. Their job is tell the story.
Laura Modi (00:44:01):
I love that.
Lenny (00:44:03):
So you talked about how you're hiring people that aren't necessarily deep in a specific skill that you need them to do. What is it that you look for instead that you think is important for them to figure out what they need to be doing?
Laura Modi (00:44:15):
Curiosity. A lot of curiosity and just openness to what's out there. I definitely look for people who have the ability to make decisions and move fast and not get worried about the outcome. That is the biggest learning in a startup. The secret is momentum and just keeping momentum. And if we try and perfect everything, you just miss the boat. And I believe that, what's the common saying, perfect is the enemy of good, or something.
Lenny (00:44:52):
Yeah, I think that's the one.
Laura Modi (00:44:54):
I mean, it really is. So I look for people who just want to do it, just get it done. Again, part of that is just rolling up your sleeves and not questioning your job. When I find in interviews and people are really questioning the lanes they're going to be in and the job they're going to do, or "I don't do that." That's saying, "I don't do that." A huge flag. You do do it. If you're joining this company, if you're within a certain work stream or a certain department and you're behind what the company's working on, in many ways we need people who do do that. So I look for just optimistic doers.
Lenny (00:45:32):
I love that. That's such a cool phrase of how to simplify it, what you want to hire and just optimistic doers. There's so many people that have big ideas and pontificate strategy, and you just need people doing the thing.
Laura Modi (00:45:44):
100%. I call it intellectual ejaculation, which, if that's not allowed of the podcast, [inaudible 00:45:52] totally wiped.
Lenny (00:45:52):
That's allowed. I'll allow it.
Laura Modi (00:45:55):
Thank you.
Lenny (00:45:57):
Okay, so you're talking about momentum. I want to talk about growth. A lot of this podcast is about growth strategy, how companies grow. You're building a D2C company. D2C is really hard. There's been so many attempts. Most fail, most people can't figure out how to do it scalably. So many challenges. What have you learned about growing D2C company? What's worked well for you?
Laura Modi (00:46:17):
This narrative of D2C isn't working, or D2C is over, D2C is dead. It kills me. Because we're being way too reductionist in that message. D2C isn't dead. Just the approach for how people did D2C is a bit dated. We should not be paying for every customer and we should be very careful that people aren't getting hooked on the drug that is paid marketing or performance marketing. And I think that drug, and then obviously as we start to see changes on the way certain performance works, it just becomes more expensive and people are resetting how they do performance marketing. The short of it is D2C is not dead. How you drive people to D2C, how you acquire customers, how you build sustainable businesses, that needs to change.
Lenny (00:47:14):
And what is it that you've done that allows you to do that? I imagine a lot of it is word-of-mouth, which everyone always wants. "How do we do more word-of-mouth?" So what's worked? How do you do that?
Laura Modi (00:47:24):
Well, I mean, the three major pieces of it is that the focus on commerce, content and community.
Lenny (00:47:30):
Commerce, content and community.
Laura Modi (00:47:33):
So commerce, content and community. But most D2C businesses have put commerce at the top of their list. We flipped it. It's now content, community and commerce, and building good content that is really smart SEO, that has the ability to drive people back to your site to be able to build you as a thought leader. That's really hard and it takes a lot of work. As an example, five years ago we started a platform called Milk Drunk, separate to Bobbie. Milk Drunk Blog. And the reason why we started it is because we realize that there was a dearth of education in the world of formula out there.
(00:48:15):
And what people were really looking for was good recommendations, usability charts, how to make formula, how long does formula last? So we wanted to become the content leaders in that, with the hypothesis, and it's holding true five years later, with the hypothesis that if we win on content and as a thought leader, that will drive back to Bobbie. And today I'm going to give you a totally random example. If you do a cursory Google search for something like "How long does formula last?" Milk Drunk is showing up between the CDC and the bum on the first page of Google? That SEO work and that content building and thought leadership and credibility does take a lot of work. And in the meantime, I've had to squat away requests to put another 100,000, another 300,000 every month into paid marketing because the moment that drug starts, it's very easy to keep it going.
Lenny (00:49:15):
I think Airbnb is a great example of that. During COVID, they shut down paid growth and I think they've turned it on, but it's a tiny component, which is really unusual and really rare, where you have paid growth, you're sending tons of money, Facebook, and then you stop. It's so hard to stop because growth slows and no one ever wants to do that. And it's interesting, coming back to using a crisis as an opportunity, Airbnb use that as an opportunity to get off that drug.
Laura Modi (00:49:40):
That's right. Yeah.
Lenny (00:49:42):
If you think about the pie chart of what helps Bobbie grow, how much of it would you say is just like make an awesome product that people talk about with other moms and it spreads like that, versus SEO and content and paid?
Laura Modi (00:49:55):
60% of it is your product and the package around the product, which is your brand. So even if you did nothing to market your brand, your product and brand is 60% of it. And then the last 40% is how do you get the word out there? How do you ensure the word-of-mouth, mom begets mom? That has to happen. That flywheel will only happen if they're able to look at a product that they fully believe in and a brand that speaks to them. And without that, you're going to be a fast-fashion company, which is also my worst nightmare, the fear that people get distracted by the 40% and the 60% actually is just mediocre.
Lenny (00:50:43):
Something I wasn't planning to ask, but I thought it'd be interesting and we can cut this if it's not interesting, is Emily Oster, she's one of the, I think, pioneers of breastfeeding is not as great as people say necessarily. Has that been really important to Bobbie in this industry? What do you think of Emily Oster? I'm a huge fan, so I hope you're also a big fan.
Laura Modi (00:51:01):
We are massive fans of Emily and Emily's a massive fan of Bobbie. She is my idol. She's the one who got me through my first year of pregnancy and then beyond. She has been a really, really important voice. And actually she has kind of set the stage for the power of data to bust myths. I mean, just like you said, she's come out and said, "There is no study, no study at all out there that you can point to that can qualify why breastfeeding is better." And to have an economist, a professor, come out and to be able to underscore that and point to where that is the case and why it is the case. I mean, it's so much better than a company. To be fair, companies are brands coming out trying to say that. So I am acutely aware that, as a business and as a brand, sometimes we need to bring in other credible voices. And my God, Emily is one of those.
Lenny (00:52:05):
I love it. Okay, great. I'm glad. I'm glad you love her. I've been reading all our books. I think I just read that section.
Laura Modi (00:52:11):
You read her books. I love it. You're not a dad yet, you'll like all of them, Family Firm.
Lenny (00:52:14):
Okay, the first two. The first two. Cribsheet. I'll stop there, I think. And I was actually just reading the breastfeeding section and it's funny, one of the only remaining benefits of breastfeeding is less cow farts and creating methane. Unrelated to your child, there's a cow component.
Laura Modi (00:52:32):
We do want to cut down on the farts.
Lenny (00:52:35):
We do. We do. Not what I thought of when I thought of why should I go with formula or not. Maybe just zooming out a little bit and to kind of close, are there any other lessons that you've learned along this journey about building a company, hiring, team building, anything along those lines? Creating urgency, creating momentum?
Laura Modi (00:52:56):
I mean, momentum. Momentum really is it. We did this a good bit at Airbnb too. I think as a founder and as a CEO or for any leader out there, your job is not just to keep people going on momentum. Your job is to make momentum. And sometimes that momentum has to be manufactured. And that has been one of my biggest lessons on just how, as leaders and people starting companies, how do you force yourself? And sometimes when it's early on, you're actually just doing it to yourself, creating manufactured deadlines and launch dates.
(00:53:36):
The amount of times people say to me, "Why are we launching this May 1st?" And I'm like, "Just because we said it. Because if we don't do it now, we may never do it." It was something we were talking about the last day on just how important it is to look at the fuel that keeps you going and how you have to kind of force those milestones to get you there. So yeah, I would say manufacture yourself some momentum.
Lenny (00:54:00):
I so agree with that. One of my favorite things and one of our former colleagues, Vanessa, taught me this, which is just like, "Let's all set an arbitrary deadline right now." And just make it clear, this is just arbitrary, but it's useful.
Laura Modi (00:54:13):
It's so true.
Lenny (00:54:15):
Well, with that, Laura, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
Laura Modi (00:54:18):
Who?
Lenny (00:54:19):
I don't know if I told you this was coming, but it is. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for exciting lightning round?
Laura Modi (00:54:26):
I think I am. Let's do it.
Lenny (00:54:27):
Okay, let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Laura Modi (00:54:33):
One recently, Great by Choice, the author of From Good to Great, amazing.
Lenny (00:54:40):
Jim Collins?
Laura Modi (00:54:40):
Some really, really good frameworks. Yes, that's right. Really good frameworks in there. Metabolical, very specific into the world of health, healthcare. Actually, very specifically the takeaway of Metabolical is we don't have a healthcare crisis in this country, we have a health crisis. And it really makes you think about the source, food and how we live our lives. It's amazing. And then I think you a really good traditional one, going back to just brand and for people who are really just looking for a good foundation, I love Purple Cow.
Lenny (00:55:13):
I love that. I think I have it in my back around here.
Laura Modi (00:55:15):
You do?
Lenny (00:55:15):
There it is, yeah. Tiny little book. It's so cute.
Laura Modi (00:55:18):
That is so good.
Lenny (00:55:20):
Yeah. Also, we could mention Emily Oster's book, Laura, Expecting Better.
Laura Modi (00:55:23):
I mean, we should. Expecting Better is a good classic.
Lenny (00:55:27):
Your list is reminding me of a new book by Peter Attia, that I don't know if you've seen, called Outlive, I think it's called. It's about longevity and how to live longer and all the latest sciences and how to live a longer life. But anyway, that's my answer and I'm asking you questions, so let's move on to the next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Laura Modi (00:55:44):
Bad Sisters. Do you have bad sisters?
Lenny (00:55:47):
No.
Laura Modi (00:55:48):
About a group of Irish sisters getting up to trouble. Highly recommended.
Lenny (00:55:53):
Amazing. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're hiring people?
Laura Modi (00:55:57):
Teach me something. Actually, we just talked about that today. Teach me something. Yeah. I love getting someone to, not related to work, not related to their job, something in your life, something you find interesting, just teach me about it.
Lenny (00:56:11):
What is it that you look for in their answer that gives you a sense that they're someone that you want to hire?
Laura Modi (00:56:16):
Creative, but also just their ability to explain something, and it is a huge indicator. I mean, I'll never forget one guy teaching me how to cook the perfect steak, and now every time I cook a steak, I go back to the way he described it, to someone being able to teach me the foundation of Latin. But if someone's unable to take one thing that they find is core to who they are and what they've done or what they understand and their inability to explain that to you, they may struggle.
Lenny (00:56:49):
I want to learn how to cook a perfect steak. I'm going to have to interview you at some point and ask you about that. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love? And especially if it's a baby product, that'll be bonus.
Laura Modi (00:57:01):
I mean, yeah, I think Frida Baby's amazing, the nose sucker.
Lenny (00:57:06):
Okay, great. The nose sucker.
Laura Modi (00:57:08):
Actually, no. Sorry, the nose sucker. That's terrible. It's the snot sucker.
Lenny (00:57:13):
Okay, great.
Laura Modi (00:57:13):
As a new parent, you really, really need this, Lenny. Your poor little boy is going to get blocked up and you're going to want to get out that sucker and suck on it-
Lenny (00:57:23):
Oh, dear.
Laura Modi (00:57:23):
... and get it out. I can see you quickly looking for the next question. Move away from the snot sucker.
Lenny (00:57:30):
No, this is great.
Laura Modi (00:57:31):
So I'll leave you with that.
Lenny (00:57:33):
Perfect. We'll just call the episode The Snot Sucker. So many options. Okay, next question. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in the way that you build/ship product that was minor but had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute and ship?
Laura Modi (00:57:51):
More recently, async work. Moving away from meeting culture and being able to be in a position where we can work async, whether it's one-hour sprint over Slack, make decisions and go back and forth, 20 people, and then everyone's made a decision by the end of the hour and we're moving forward.
Lenny (00:58:12):
Is there a tool that helps you do that or is it just in Slack? "Here's the question we're trying to answer," and everyone-
Laura Modi (00:58:16):
You know what? Every so often we try and introduce tools and then it's like we've over-processed this entire thing, when what we really just need to do is all just get our head into the moment we're in and brand it and get it done. So even though I think we've introduced some tools, I know we use some video ones as well. I'm a little bit removed sometimes from everyone working through these tools, but I'm in the Slack world the most.
Lenny (00:58:40):
Final question, what is your best advice for a soon-to-be parent, aka, me?
Laura Modi (00:58:45):
Hire a sitter who you love that you want to have on board every Thursday night and keep your date night with Michelle, whatever your date night is, and just don't worry about the price because the date is worth it, but just lock it in and do it.
Lenny (00:59:03):
We actually have a date night currently with another couple who has two kids, and so we could just maintain that. How early do you hire a sitter to do that, in their age?
Laura Modi (00:59:13):
Second week.
Lenny (00:59:14):
Second week. Okay, great. Not first week.
Laura Modi (00:59:16):
Okay. Maybe second month. It totally depends on how you guys are feeling.
Lenny (00:59:23):
No. Okay, that early.
Laura Modi (00:59:24):
That depends on how she's feeling, but I would say sometimes you just need to rip the bandaid and you need to go for it, even if it means the two of you are just going out for a quick meal and you're coming back, keep your date night.
Lenny (00:59:33):
Laura, this was as fun and insightful as I expected. I'm going to go try some Bobbie, I'm going to go by snot suckers. Thank you so much for spending time here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, learn more about Bobbie, potentially, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Laura Modi (00:59:51):
Okay. Well, the first thing I'm going to say, how listeners can be useful. I am hiring a growth product manager right now and we are really focused on optimization. So now I'm moving away from everything I just said and I want a specialist who's really good at growth optimization. And how folks can find us, our website is hibobbie, H-I bobbie, B-O-B-B-I-E.com. And if folks just want to reach out to me, I would highly recommend just sending me an email, Laura@hibobbie.com.
Lenny (01:00:20):
And for the hiring position, how do they go apply for that and learn more about it?
Laura Modi (01:00:24):
Great question. I'm assuming it's on our careers page on the website.
Lenny (01:00:27):
Great. We'll make sure it's there before this all goes out.
Laura Modi (01:00:29):
Amazing.
Lenny (01:00:30):
Laura, this is amazing. Thank you so much for being here.
Laura Modi (01:00:33):
It's such a pleasure, Lenny. This is so fun.
Lenny (01:00:35):
It's my pleasure. And goodbye, everyone.
Laura Modi (01:00:37):

# Lessons from one of the world’s top executive recruiters | Lauren Ipsen (Daversa Partners, GC)

## Transcript

Lauren Ipsen (00:00:00):
Regardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.

Lauren Ipsen (00:00:35):
Oftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.

Lenny (00:01:05):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Lauren Ipsen.

Lenny (00:01:15):
One of the most important skills for founders and senior product leaders to develop is the ability to hire great people. You won't be able to build the best company or the best product if you can't hire the best people. And Lauren is one of the most experienced and successful people in the world when it comes to hiring product leaders. She's placed over 80 senior product leaders across tech companies and has worked with some of the biggest companies out there. When I asked a bunch of really smart product leaders who their favorite product recruiter was, Lauren's name came up a ton.

Lenny (00:01:46):
In our conversation, we get super tactical about what founders need to do to find the best product talent, what product managers should be doing during their career to give themselves the most opportunity, and we also touch on what recruiters themselves often get wrong when trying to attract great talent. This episode is rich with actionable advice for basically everyone, and I am really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Lauren Ipsen.

Lenny (00:02:12):
Who has an opinion on internal tools? Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them, but if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool, and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises, but for small teams as well. And as you scale your company, Retool scales with you.

Lenny (00:02:57):
Snowflake saves about 26 hours a week of manual spreadsheet work with custom internal apps built on Retool. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. Thousands of teams at companies like Coinbase, DoorDash, and NBC collaborate around custom-built Retool apps to operate with greater efficiency.

Lenny (00:03:17):
Maybe you've thought about using Retool before but just haven't, and I'm here to tell you that now teams of up to five can build unlimited Retool apps for free. Get started today at retool.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:03:31):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without, is damn hard, but it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly. That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours.

Lenny (00:03:53):
I actually used Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with the pen tool or put their own images or mock-ups right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready made templates, you can go from discovering research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks.

Lenny (00:04:24):
Want to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:04:45):
Lauren, thank you for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lauren Ipsen (00:04:47):
Thanks so much. It's great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:50):
I've been meeting to do an episode on product hiring and recruiting product people for a while, and when I asked a bunch of smart friends who should I have on to talk about this stuff, your name came up a bunch, and so I'm really happy that we're finally doing this.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:03):
Me too. Absolutely. I'm grateful that you asked.

Lenny (00:05:07):
So, to help listeners get a sense of just your background and kind of the journey you've been on to get to where you are now, can you just spend maybe just a minute kind of talking through the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're doing now?

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:19):
Yeah, absolutely. So I started my career in broadcast. I originally thought that I wanted to be on the news and quickly realized I didn't necessarily want to be the face of sadness. There's a ton of that happening in the world.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:36):
So, made a pivot pretty early on and thought, where could I use the communication skills that I've been working so hard on and do something that's impactful in a big way, but maybe just with a little bit of a different angle? And stumbled across executive search.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:52):
Exec search is not really something that people major in college by any means or think they're going to end up doing. So it was something I found fascinating. I had applied to all of these different companies like Twitter and Snap and Pinterest, hadn't heard back from any of them, was a name in the resumes, and thought, well, how cool would it be if I could work with all of them and have an opportunity to play a part from a different lens?

Lauren Ipsen (00:06:18):
So, got into exec search, was really focused early on on consumer mobile build outs. Was doing a lot of work with Twitter and Reddit and TaskRabbit and Nextdoor, Postmates, you name it, and that was probably 85% of the work I was doing. And then as, on the agency side, 15% was obscure, autonomous helicopters selling into the Department of Defense and then retail and robotics, and it was all very fascinating, but for me, who has wicked bad ADD, it was amazing to be able to be so stimulated by so many different industries and feel like I couldn't really master this.

Lauren Ipsen (00:06:57):
So, long story short, had an awesome career at Daversa Partners, which is a boutique executive search firm, and thought I was going to be there potentially forever. Was tapped by a awesome individual, Abe Shafi, who was founding a company. I had been doing a lot of work for them. They were a client of mine at the time. Placed a couple great hires and they said, "We're either going to kick off a head of talent search with you or you can come over and join us." So I was the first recruiting hire over there, built out the talent function in its entirety.

Lauren Ipsen (00:07:27):
I definitely think there was a part of me that I loved the operating experience, learned a ton, worked side by side some amazing people, but was really missing working with founders, and lots of them, and keeping a pulse on the market. So General Catalyst tapped me most recently, and been working here for the past couple months, and it's been great thus far, and I'm specializing in our consumer and crypto investments.

Lenny (00:07:51):
Awesome. The fact that you're at GC now makes me think about another recruiter that I know who's awesome, Austin Brizendine, and it's interesting that a lot of the best recruiters seem to be heading to VC funds, and I'm curious why that is happening. Is it like a comp thing? Is it other things that are pulling everyone away into funds?

Lauren Ipsen (00:08:09):
It's a great question. It's definitely not a comp thing. I'll say that. I think it could be a stability of life thing. Search is incredibly volatile, and you have to hustle so hard, and as soon as you have three wins, you've got four more things to execute on. And so, there's aspects of it that can be tough, especially in a market like right now where you really do have to chase business and you can't be selective about what you take on, so you could be pitching things that maybe you don't necessarily believe in in its entirety or what have you. So, I think that's one component.

Lauren Ipsen (00:08:39):
In house is obviously difficult right now as well for talent leaders. It's really scary to take a bet on one single company right now and know what it's going to look like six months from now. And so I think those things combined might be the reason for an influx in folks leaning more towards venture, and I think it's just timeliness.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Got it. That makes sense. The downside is it's hard for people to find awesome recruiters because once you're in a fund, you're just going to help those startups. And so we're going to talk later about just how do people find awesome recruiters, what do you look for? But there's roughly three things I want to spend our time chatting through today. One is for founders and hiring managers, just how to find the best talent and what they could do to be successful finding the best talent. Two is for product leaders and PMs, how to give themselves the most opportunity from the flip side. And then third is just for recruiters, what do they often do wrong? How do they miss out on the best product talent? Does that sound good?

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:37):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Lenny (00:09:39):
Okay, cool. So on the hiring front, just diving in, say you are a founder, you're someone really early at a company, and maybe you've got a couple PMs and you're starting to think about we need to hire a really senior product leader or first senior product leader.

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:52):
Sure.

Lenny (00:09:53):
What do you find is often the biggest mistake that founders make when they're trying to hire their first senior product leader?

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:59):
I think especially for founders that haven't hired for this caliber of talent in the past, it's really easy to be distracted by shiny objects and look at huge names. You want to find the CPOs of Google and YouTube or what have you because that seems like it would be such an incredible opportunity for brand recognition. And to an extent, it is. But the fact of the matter is, oftentimes those individuals are pretty far from the work and have a great team of executors that they've put into place that are actually the ones that are in the weeds.

Lauren Ipsen (00:10:33):
And so I think that's the biggest mistake I see people make, especially on the hiring front where they have limited resources, and maybe they're an early stage company and trying so hard to bring in big names is not always the best way to go about it because the fact of the matter is they need to go then hire a team. So, I think looking for someone that's a little closer to the work, maybe someone that can step up into that type of role and do so in a way where some days they might actually be operating like a PM and then other days they might be able to build from a leadership perspective, that's more of the DNA that people should be targeting.

Lenny (00:11:09):
Do you think the source of the issue with that going wrong, that they no longer can do that work as well because they've been shielded away from the tactical day to day? Or is it that they're not as hungry as they used to be and they're just like, "I already, I'm a YouTube 10 year super success, I don't need to prove myself anymore," and they're just not as hungry, or something else?

Lauren Ipsen (00:11:29):
I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say that all senior leaders aren't hungry. I think that there's some folks that really lean into the work in a different way and miss that, and often go to startups because they crave building.

Lauren Ipsen (00:11:41):
So it's not necessarily that, but I do tend to lean towards folks that have a chip on their shoulder or have something to prove and want to build a name for themselves. All of that to say, there's a reason that a lot of those people got to where they are, and some of the best talent are some of the senior folks, but just maybe not necessarily the best talent for where this company is today. Right? It could be great for 10 years down the road, but the past five years of that individual's career could have been far more focused on camaraderie, team building, operational components, performance reviews, and then aspects of product vision, which just might not be the innovative AB testing type of profile that you typically look for in these pre-IPO companies.

Lenny (00:12:27):
Got it. I imagine there are stories that you can share about people you've placed like that, that have not worked out. If you can share one, that'd be awesome. But maybe a side question is the general advice, just don't assume someone that's been successful at a big company with a fancy background is going to be great. Sometimes they work out, but not always, is that kind of the takeaway?

Lauren Ipsen (00:12:46):
Yeah. I would say the general advice is who is going to be best for this specific role at this specific time, not necessarily who is the best talent in the world or in the market. Those are two very, very different questions to ask. And I think early on in my recruiting career, I was often just trying to recruit these whales of executives to try and prove myself and say, "Oh, I got this person to entertain this opportunity, how sick is that?" But naturally, that's not necessarily the person that actually can move the needle. And so you need to think very specifically. Just because this is the best talent, that doesn't necessarily mean they are the best talent for this role today.

Lenny (00:13:25):
So to double down on that, say you are hiring and you know you're going to start hiring a senior product leader, what is it that you suggest founders nail down and iron out when they're kicking off the hiring process, either on their own or with a recruiter? Like, in the job description, what else do they have to get right to find the right person?

Lauren Ipsen (00:13:48):
It's a number of things, like product leaders can come in a lot of different flavors, and so I think it's trying to determine where this person should major and minor, where they should spike. Is this someone that's going to really lean into the design efforts? Is it someone that actually kind of needs to just operate like a very senior PM and continue to build out a team? Is this someone that really should be focused on product vision for the long haul? And then thinking more holistically about how to build the rest of the team.

Lauren Ipsen (00:14:12):
There's so many different ways in which you can hire for a product leader. So I think it's trying to work a little bit backwards and think about, what is the actual outcome that we are trying to solve for with this hire? Or are we just hiring a head of product because we feel like we need to hire a head of product? That's so often what I see is the board's telling me we need to hire a head of product and I don't necessarily think that we do, or I'm not exactly sure what we need in this role. And so whenever you're starting a search in that regard, it's kind of doomed from inception, so you need to get incredibly granular on the front end around, what is this person going to be coming in to do? What's their mandate? And if we think about someone that's just absolutely hitting it out of the park and crushing it, what does that look like? So I think just trying to be really specific on the front end.

Lenny (00:14:59):
I love that last piece, just what does success really look like for this person? On the first piece, that's exactly the same advice I give founders when they're looking for a PM is like, what do you concretely need them to do day to day? Not like, "We need someone to help us with product." And that often helps illuminate, okay, I see. We need someone to help us ship more consistently. We need someone to help us hire engineers. Yeah, just make a list. What are they going to do in the first month or two or three?

Lauren Ipsen (00:15:24):
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think those are the most important things. Like the 90 day plan is something that's overused but so necessary, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. So that component and then, okay, a year from now, what should this person be doing? Two years from now? Do we want them to grow up into a CPO role? Do we think about that in a different way? How are we thinking about the product direction today, 12 months from now, 18 months from now, through IPO? I think it's really difficult to think about things that way, and so often you're thinking about the task in front of you and just trying to iterate quickly, but that is the type of thought process that needs to be happening from the CEOs and founders.

Lenny (00:16:06):
Are there archetypes of PMs, if you just bucket like here's the three maybe most common types of product leaders that founders hire, because there's an infinite list of skills and things they could do, but just to make it even simpler, like here's probably one of these three you're looking for. Do you have something like that in your head?

Lauren Ipsen (00:16:25):
Yeah, there's platform product leaders or folks that are kind of more indexed on the infrastructure components. There's folks that are typically focused on core product, or consumer product if it's on the consumer side of things. And then you'll have folks that are really indexed and that can include UX individuals, design folks. And then there's also typically specialists, so individuals that are really hyper-focused on growth or monetization or what have you. Those are the three buckets that I would say I see most often.

Lenny (00:16:57):
Do you feel like founders sometimes pick one of the wrong buckets and that's a common mistake, or is it generally it's the wrong bucket but then maybe it's not the right spikes of skills within that bucket?

Lauren Ipsen (00:17:08):
Well, it's kind of twofold. I think sometimes people just bring in a head of product to do everything, so that's probably not the best way to go about things. I think that ends up being a unicorn, which you hear often in the search world, and it becomes really difficult to hone in on what good looks like.

Lauren Ipsen (00:17:25):
And so I think again, it just comes back to having a clear org chart on the front end and determining, are we hiring someone specifically to build out our walled garden ads approach, or are we hiring someone to run product marketing, or are we hiring someone to help from a product perspective to build a better core user experience? Those are all very, very, very different roles, and if you bring in one person to try and do it all, the facts of the matter is, they're going to have to bring in some key lieutenants to help them, so is that something you want to do or are you more focused on bringing in someone imminently to help on the ad side of things, and then we can find that head of product to help them out down the road?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:05):
That's kind of the way in which I would architect it and think about it, is what's most imminent, and what do you actually need to hire for today, as opposed to just hiring for the sake of hiring and bringing in that leader.

Lenny (00:18:17):
And part of the discussion there is maybe they grow up into this head of product long term, maybe not. Maybe we just need someone to ship the ads platform, right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:24):
That's exactly right. Yeah.

Lenny (00:18:26):
You mentioned this title of head of product. There's also VP of product, CPO. There's all these titles and I feel like people sometimes use them interchangeably, don't know which one to use when they're putting out a job description. Do you have any kind of heuristic rule of thumb of just, here's how to think about when to use each of these titles? Or is it not even a big deal for, say, a founder, hiring the first senior product leader?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:48):
It's a great question and it definitely leads to confusion across the board because I'll have candidates come to me and they'll say, "I'm only looking for a CPO role," when I'm working with a startup where, maybe on the venture side of things, we've actually advised that startup to not hire C-level executives at this point. And so that naturally could eliminate a candidate that could be amazing for the role.

Lauren Ipsen (00:19:15):
Similarly, people could feel that way if it's a VP of product role, but that in their mind is the most senior product leader within the organization running everything from end to end who they intend to be the CPO down the road but are not in a position where they're ready to hire C-level execs. So, it's tough, and it really depends on the organization and the way in which they're thinking about org charts and leveling.

Lauren Ipsen (00:19:39):
A lot of startups at this point are almost allergic to C titles or VP titles or are just more title agnostic than I've seen in the past, so you see a lot more of these head ofs, and that is sector leaders, up until probably C plus or D stage. And then you get to D and E, and you'll see more of the VP, director, CPO type. And I think that is the way that people should be thinking about it is, if I'm joining a company very, very early days and it's called head of engineering, that is intended to be the most senior engineering leader within the organization.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:19):
The fact of the matter though is there's good reason sometimes why they're not throwing out that C title, and could this person be layered down the road? Potentially, because maybe the talent they need right now is different than, just as we had spoken to earlier, is different than the talent that they might need from a massive CPO in two and a half years.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:37):
And so I think that rubs people the wrong way because they want a bit of a promise that things are going to, if they join at this stage, that they'll be in it for the long haul and be that chief product officer that takes a company through an IPO. But companies are so dynamic and things change so quickly.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:52):
So, I guess a long-winded way of me saying there's different breadth and depth to each role, but I think for the most part, unless it's a very siloed company with multiple different VPs, if you're coming into a company and they say this is the head of product, the VP of product, or the CPO, that all means the same thing dependent on the stage, for the most part.

Lenny (00:21:14):
And the other takeaway there, which is awesome, is if you're early stage startup, probably just start with head of product. Keep it simple.

Lauren Ipsen (00:21:19):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:19):
Don't over promise. Everyone understands.

Lauren Ipsen (00:21:22):
Yeah. Because the last thing you want to do is have to demote someone. But once you get to a place of having C-level executives, like that's not going to do any good, but maybe you start as a head of product, and then as the company continues to grow, you lean into the growth side of things more, and so you become that head of growth or an SVP of growth. Like things iterate and change, but you just never know and you can't predict the outcome of a company on the front end, so.

Lenny (00:21:49):
A lot of people listening to this probably aren't hiring senior product leaders right now, but plan to and will in the future, and so I wanted to ask, what should founders do when they know they will hire a head of product, say, in the next year, that could set them up for success down the road? What should they be doing ahead of time?

Lauren Ipsen (00:22:07):
Regardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.

Lauren Ipsen (00:22:43):
Oftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.

Lenny (00:23:11):
That sounds awesome and it makes sense. How do you, as a founder, do some of that? Do you just ask folks like, "Hey, who are some of the best product leaders you know? I just want to chat with them. I'm not hiring, just want to kind of meet people who are awesome." Is that the behavior you suggest or is there something else you can do?

Lauren Ipsen (00:23:27):
That's a great way to go about it. And by simply saying, "No agenda, I'm not trying to hire you tomorrow, I just want to know great people." And to be totally honest, people feel flattered by that, typically. Most of the time if you've been referred to someone and heard nothing but great things about them and you really don't have an agenda other than wanting to pick their brain, people are like, "Huh, well, this is different from the day to day. This is fulfilling," and people want to pour their knowledge, especially into companies that they believe in.

Lauren Ipsen (00:23:58):
So, I think more often than not you'll find that, not just products leaders, but executives across the board are actually really inclined to do so and want to help out because it's a little bit different from the day to day monotony of their work life.

Lenny (00:24:12):
So, the advice is keep track of companies who are killing it, who you might be able to kind of poach from in the future, and keep a list and keep warm contact with folks that are awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (00:24:22):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:23):
It reminds me of a founder that ... or basically all founders who are really good at hiring and how far ahead they plant seeds and how they just play the long game with the best people they meet, and they just kind of keep the conversation going until they finally convince them to join a year or two later. Do you find that the same thing?

Lauren Ipsen (00:24:41):
Yeah, 1000000%. Yeah. When I was on the executive recruiting side of things at Daversa, the VP of engineering candidate that we ultimately landed, it was a seven month game of courtship, and let's bring him in to help out from an advising capacity, let's ask him how he would think about structuring this organization, let's talk to him about the best talent that he would recommend that we're spending time with. No question that's invasive, but more so just collaborative and exciting, and you'll find that the founder and that leader will build a different level of rapport and trust by not going through a formal interview process and having it feel transactional. And then with that, magic can happen and you can land incredible people.

Lenny (00:25:24):
This all sounds like a lot of work and a lot of time. Do you have guidance on how long it should take to find, like for a early stage startup, say series A or B, to find someone awesome, and/or how much time founders should spend a week, just best practice, on hiring for someone like this?

Lauren Ipsen (00:25:41):
I mean, I think if you're going to search, so if you're looking for this individual, it's really so case to case. There's searches that I've been in that I call three people. I know they're amazing for this. I tell the founder and CEO, "These are the three people you should chat with, hire one of them." And it's that easy.

Lauren Ipsen (00:25:59):
There's others where it's a lot of trying to figure out what the person's actually looking for. If there's some ... they hit it off from an emotional standpoint. There's so many different things that come with it. I would say from a timing perspective, it's not a hard number. It's more of just put yourself in the room with great people. If you have a tremendous amount of respect for someone, continue to harvest that relationship and ask what good looks like. Find excuses to continue to touch base with people that are important in your network. If you remembered that they'd mentioned that they were going to some event and you think that you might want to hire them down the road, in a non-creepy way, show up to that event. These are things that I'm constantly doing, and I think that founders can do a better job of, but just make yourself known and relevant. And then when you reach out and timing is right, it won't feel so obscure or so transactional.

Lenny (00:26:55):
That reminds me of a time at Airbnb where we had these meetups for engineers every month or so where it was a tech talk, and then all the engineers get a target engineer that is coming to the event. Like they get their profile and their picture, and their job is to make sure they have a great time and try to convince them to join someday.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:14):
Oh my god. But it's so real. It's similar to college trips where you're trying to get recruited for a sport, and you have to ensure that you're, yeah, just continuing to give people the best experience possible and staying top of mind for people.

Lenny (00:27:28):
Yeah. But I can see it being creepy, They have no idea there's this person assigned to them, but it works. It worked great. It was a great tactic.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:35):
That's awesome.

Lenny (00:27:36):
I want to come back to a question that I asked, but I feel like you'll have an actual more concrete answer to the specific piece of just, what's your guidance per week how much time you should be spending on hiring broadly, and specifically, heads of product, if that's any different. Do you have any just advice? Because I imagine it's always spend more time than you think. It's going to take a lot of time.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:54):
Yeah, it's definitely spend more time than you think. If you are in an actual search, then you should devote all of your time to it. I know that sucks to hear, but you should be really carving out concrete time.

Lauren Ipsen (00:28:05):
The thing that's tough though is you could spend, I guess what I was trying to say is you could spend one hour on something or you could spend 10 hours on it, but it's more so around, are you doing things to be impactful during that period of time? Are you actually doing things that are going to move the needle? Are you just blindly reaching out to people on LinkedIn? Because that's not going to be the way in which you're going to find the best of the best. Some of the greatest talent, they're not even on LinkedIn.

Lauren Ipsen (00:28:32):
And so I think it's building a really strong network in advance, and then once you actually get to a place where you need to hire that person, calling all of those amazing people that you've built relationships with and saying, "Now tell me who your favorite person is and who the best person you've ever worked with is, and could you put me on a thread with them?" How are you going to differentiate yourself from the rest of the market? So it's less in my mind like a quantitative number of hours and more of, how are you doing things differently than the rest of the market?

Lenny (00:29:01):
I want to pull on this thread. Okay, so spending one hour versus 10 hours, and your point about how you could spend one hour and get as much done maybe in those 10 hours. What sorts of behaviors and actions should folks take to make use of, say, that one hour in hiring? How do you not waste your time?

Lauren Ipsen (00:29:18):
I mean, I would say I've got probably five of my all time favorite product leaders in the world that I tap whenever I'm kicking off a search. And they know that whenever life brings them to an opportunity where they are going to start looking or want to lean into board opportunities, that I'm going to set them up and shout their name from the rooftop, so oftentimes they're willing to point me in the right direction of great people, make those introductions, what have you, and I'm going to know simply because of how great they are that they would never put me in touch with someone that wasn't equally as qualified.

Lauren Ipsen (00:29:55):
So that I think because the quality is there, so I'm not just blindly guessing on quantity, spending a ton of time on LinkedIn, and then having to call unknown entities and ask for back channel references when they also might not even feel comfortable sharing the dirt. You know? So it comes back to rapport and people that you have around you that you know you can trust and tap into and ensuring that you're spending the time in the right areas.

Lenny (00:30:19):
Got it. Yeah, so tapping your network makes a lot of sense. If you don't have that yet, I guess is it worth spending time on LinkedIn just cold messaging people as a founder, and any tips there for just cold outreach that you think work for a founder doing it versus you who are a professional at it?

Lauren Ipsen (00:30:37):
I do think it is worth that time. If you see someone that looks amazing, hell yeah, reach out to them, spend time with them, why not? And oftentimes, again, people are excited to see, oh, this CEO and founder wants to pick my brain, doesn't look like they're coming at me to try and recruit me, but rather just to have an open-ended conversation. For sure, and they can sense. You can definitely sense that type of interaction and feel comfortable with it, whereas sometimes the walls immediately go up when someone senses that they're trying to get poached.

Lauren Ipsen (00:31:08):
And so it's I think something that's worth them doing for sure. It's just if you are going to look for a key executive and are on a time crunch, I don't necessarily think the best use of your time is blindly reaching out to executives when you don't necessarily have the expertise in knowing which companies were thriving during that period of time, which organizations were great, and which were a little bit weaker within companies. All of those things are just the inner workings of the recruiting atmosphere and technology, and I think tapping people, if you don't have the network, talk to a great recruiter or just spend some time kind of doing some research on who's great. You can ask investors or board members in your companies as to who you should be targeting. So there's always got to be one or two people that can at least point you to another three or four.

Lenny (00:31:56):
That reminds me of a tactic Gokul shared on this podcast about one of his best tricks, as you think of, if you're hiring salespeople, instead of looking for who are just the best salespeople, you look for the company that is known for being really good at sales and then you go find people there and try to poach their lieutenant types, not maybe necessarily their head of sales. Do you think that's a good move?

Lauren Ipsen (00:32:17):
Yes and no.

Lenny (00:32:18):
Ooh.

Lauren Ipsen (00:32:19):
Yes and no, because I think if the organization is incredibly good at sales then the majority of the folks are probably amazing, but you always have weak links, and just because someone has a brand on their resume at the right time, I think oftentimes CEOs and founders will do this thing where they kind over generalize, well, Amazon's Prime team at this time was amazing or something like that. It's like, they definitely could have been, but just as any other company, there's going to be people that are breakout, top 1% type individuals, and then other individuals that get to ride the wave and reap the benefits of being at the right place at the right time. And I think that's a good starting place, but then also spending time getting a little bit deeper on who the best people are within that organization. But yeah, we always start with market mapping, so determining who the best companies are within a specific area, and then I just encourage everyone to take that a layer deeper.

Lenny (00:33:16):
Got it. It just comes back to your previous piece of advice. Don't assume someone that has an awesome logo is going to be great, but sometimes they are. There's a question I should have asked you at the beginning that I'm going to ask now. How many folks have you placed? How many companies have you worked with? And then also, is there a story of just your favorite person that you've placed/company you've helped hire that comes to mind?

Lauren Ipsen (00:33:36):
Yeah. So both great questions. I've placed probably 85 executives over the course of my career, and then lots of entry level employees when I was in house, and also some great key leaders. Yeah, probably 85 searches that I've opened and closed, so that's been incredibly fulfilling work. It's also fun too on the exec side of things because you hire the VP of engineering at Postmates and you see firsthand the product change. You know, you watch those types of things happen before your eyes, which is, it's fulfilling stuff, it's really cool.

Lenny (00:34:09):
And delivery gets there faster too.

Lauren Ipsen (00:34:10):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, that's really fun. Favorite placement of all time has got to be the VP of engineering that I placed at IRL, which is, to be completely honest, a big reason that I joined that company. Alex Strand is his name, and he is just the most incredible, atypical, high emotional intelligent engineering leader. Still super technical, but has managed teams in the hundreds, built out Amazon Prime Day, then went on to build the core messaging platform at Snapchat, called him and he was like, "Why would I ever leave? There's a ton of financial incentive and a team that I've built that all loves me."

Lauren Ipsen (00:34:54):
And we got him to ultimately make a move in two weeks, which is just kind of unheard of, although it ended up being like a seven month push for a start date, but that was a big reason why I went and joined IRL was to work side by side him and help build out his team and learn to get more deep on the technical side of things. Because oftentimes, on the executive level, as mentioned before, can be sometimes more of that people management type role. And so he just felt like this unique hybrid of an individual, and yeah, you close searches and you cross your fingers and hope for the best and feel very good about it, but he was one where I had all the confidence in the world that I could not have done better. You know? I just felt so great about that. So, that was a good one.

Lenny (00:35:38):
I don't know how much more confidence you could instill in a candidate joining a company than the recruiter also then joining the company.

Lauren Ipsen (00:35:44):
Yeah, I did say that to him. I kept saying, "And if I were to go in house, I swear this is probably the company I would do it for." And then about four weeks after he signed, I'd texted him and I said, "Well, you'll never guess."

Lenny (00:35:58):
Wow.

Lauren Ipsen (00:35:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:36:00):
Amazing. What a stamp of confidence.

Lauren Ipsen (00:36:02):
Yeah. And a full circle life moment. I sent him a box of cookies, he sent it back and said, "Your turn."

Lenny (00:36:07):
And is he still there at IRL? Awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (00:36:09):
Yes, he is. He's great.

Lenny (00:36:12):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

Lenny (00:36:37):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

Lenny (00:36:51):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

Lenny (00:37:29):
I want to shift a little bit to kind of flip to the product person's perspective and talk about, how do you be successful as a product leader in finding new opportunities and giving yourself opportunities in the space? And so maybe a first question is just generally, what should product leaders and PMs focus on to give themselves the most opportunity in their career?

Lauren Ipsen (00:37:51):
I think breadth is incredibly important. It's so critical, especially if someone has an end goal of wanting to step into a product leadership role to have been able to have touched lots of different components, as opposed to specializing in one specific thing. So I would say that's very important, to be able to make sure that you're maximizing opportunities for yourself down the road.

Lauren Ipsen (00:38:12):
And then as mentioned before, just always keeping a pulse on the market, regardless of how happy you are in your current company, regardless of what the project is that you're so incredibly excited about that isn't going to conclude until Q1 of next year. It's just so important that you always know the companies that are doing great things and keep those windows open for people, because you never know what the next 12 months hold, and you want to be in a position where you're never running out the door looking for what's next, but rather being able to be super selective about the things that you have in front of you. And that comes with time and network building and relationship building over years, honestly.

Lenny (00:38:54):
And when you say breadth, are you saying things like work on the platform team for a bit, work on the user facing team, maybe the internal tools team, like different types of product, or something else?

Lauren Ipsen (00:39:04):
Exactly that. Yeah. I think there's people that probably want to just be a specialist in growth, or want to get super deep on ads, and if that's the case, then by all means, do so. And I think there's something to be said about that as well because those types of skillsets will be needed. But if you're looking to diversify your skillset, continue to grow from a career trajectory perspective and think about potentially being in a head of product type role, I think it's really important that you touch all aspects of that.

Lenny (00:39:38):
I'm really happy to hear that because that's exactly the advice I give new PMs is that a variety of experience is one of the most powerful things you can do because you also just become a better PM because you can see how different types of products are built and how different types of teams operate and it just makes you better.

Lauren Ipsen (00:39:52):
Yes. Variety of experience, I think taking a bet on doing something more entrepreneurial, starting something, and then also joining things that are a little bit later and more established to get best practices. I think diversifying your skillset within an organization but also diversifying the work in which you're doing and the companies that you're spending time with is awesome.

Lenny (00:40:15):
Yeah. So on that, something I'm always weary of is folks jumping around between all the fancy companies to get a bunch of logos on the resume. "Oh, I worked at Snap and Facebook and Netflix," and I feel like you're just building a resume and then your life flies by, and you forget that you should enjoy the things you're doing and work on things that are fulfilling and optimized for not a great resume. And, curious your thoughts on just how often you think you should move from company to company, one to optimize for opportunities in the future, or just generally, do you recommend people try to move around or go deeper at their company? There's a bunch of questions there, but take it wherever you want to.

Lauren Ipsen (00:41:01):
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sounds good. I think it's an interesting one because logo collecting is never something that you want to be known for, and the first thing you're taught, like entry level recruiting 101 is recognize patterns of candidates that jump from place to place and don't give opportunities a full chance. So, you're spot on. That is definitely not something you want to be known for if you're a prospect.

Lauren Ipsen (00:41:27):
There's also something to be said about staying somewhere too long though. And I will say that. I think sometimes you find people that are almost loyal to a fault, and companies have tanked and all executives have left and the writing's on the wall, and they're holding onto the fact that they were hired by a really good guy or gal and they want to make it work because they care about the human being, and I think sometimes in your career you do have to be a little bit more selfish and think about what's going to be best for you in the long haul. And so maybe that is still keeping your head down and working hard while also being thoughtful about other things that are out there and not saying hard nos to opportunities that knock on your door.

Lauren Ipsen (00:42:12):
So it's one where I would say it's an art and a science because you have to be thoughtful about taking on new things and knowing when it's worth taking a bet on yourself, but also you can't run as soon as things get hard because that is recognized, and if there's a riff or an internal dispute or a new leader brought in, and that is so quick as to make you run for the fences, that's not something that people look for because startup world is hard, tech is hard. Look at the crypto world right now. Things are incredibly volatile and difficult, and you want to be able to bring people in that are going to hang with you through the highs and lows.

Lauren Ipsen (00:42:55):
We're always looking to see where people moved the needle, especially on the product side, where their fingerprints were, what they can actually point to that they did and are proud of during their time there. And so if all that they can say that they did was onboarded and moved on, then doesn't matter where you were, but it's not going to be something that I can at least stand on to cheer you on.

Lenny (00:43:22):
I really like that. A lot of this comes down to, what impact have you made? And I was going to touch on that, and your point is, one, kind of heuristic for how long to stay at a place at the minimum is have some meaningful impact you can point to that you led. Does that sound right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:43:35):
Yeah, exactly. And have that meaningful impact be something that others can speak to. I think that's huge. If you built something within the organization that you're proud of but no one knows about it, then that's more difficult to have as your stamp of approval for what you are able to accomplish there. But if you did something that cross-functional leaders were speaking to, that your team all sings the praises of, then that is something that you can put a feather in the cap and say, "Okay, I left this place better than I found it, and that's the reason that I have decided to move forward."

Lenny (00:44:15):
And I imagine part of that is reference checks. People are going to check to see if you actually were successful.

Lauren Ipsen (00:44:20):
All the time. Yup. Whether you are exploratory, opportunistic, not looking at all, people are constantly calling each other, and the world of tech is so, so, so small, and no matter how fired up you were leaving a company or what went sideways, it is so critical that you try to leave the place better than you found it and do so as seamlessly as possible, because you want people to have nothing but positive to say. And oftentimes, that ... The thing that I always find too is if I call 10 people that were a part of the same organization as someone during a given period of time and they can't speak to anything they did, in that case, no news is not necessarily good news. You want to have an impact, you want to be able to say, "I did X, Y and Z. I'm super proud of this and the reason I moved on is because I did what I came in to accomplish."

Lenny (00:45:20):
It's a little bit innately tricky for product leaders. I imagine you run into this, that sometimes you have to upset people as a product leader to get stuff done that needs to get done and maybe they disagree and then later it's like, okay, I see what you did. Is that true? Do you deal with that or is it generally like, oh, yeah, they're the great people everyone knows, like a hundred percent of people will say they're awesome?

Lauren Ipsen (00:45:38):
It's a really good question. I think there's a way to navigate conflict without rubbing people the wrong way so that they'll say negative things. There's a way to be an impactful product leader and disagree and make change, and maybe your engineering leader and design leader and marketing leader completely disagree with the direction in which you're going, but because you have all of the data to support it and because you have gone about things in a way that feels very fact first and less emotional, it's really difficult for them to then point to why they disliked this person.

Lenny (00:46:19):
Yeah. This is interesting. So say you make those 10 calls, in your experience, the leaders you want to hire, are you finding 10 out of 10 are generally like, "Yes, this person's amazing, you should hire them"?

Lauren Ipsen (00:46:31):
There's ones that are slam dunks and no one has any negative to say. That's incredibly rare. More often you find some people like to just have something negative to say, just to have something negative to say. I also take all of my back channels with a grain of salt. Maybe the person I'm calling to back channel this person with I also haven't back channeled, right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:46:50):
So every single thing that you hear, you just take, make note of, and then move on and think more holistically about. But I think typically what I would say is the glaring nos are very obvious. People that are polarizing individuals or have done wrong within an organization or made bad calls across the board are, you can get that information typically pretty quick.

Lauren Ipsen (00:47:13):
It's the mixed ones where it's, "I think that person was decent," those are pretty tough, and you need to really find people that worked super closely with them because otherwise it's pretty difficult to say whether or not they were able to make an impact. Which again comes back to why right off the bat it's so nice to just have people that you can tap within every organization that's like an academy company or a great company and say, "Point me in the direction of the three best people." I don't want to have to go through the burden of having to try and back channel all of the maybe middle 50% or what have you.

Lenny (00:47:48):
Yeah, most people don't have that, which is a reason to hire, work with a recruiter. You come build in with all of that network.

Lauren Ipsen (00:47:55):
Totally. Totally there. Yeah.

Lenny (00:47:56):
There's a couple things I want to touch on that I wasn't planning to touch on, but reference calls. You do a lot of them, I imagine. And I'm curious, do you have any tips for how to ask questions on a reference call where you actually get useful advice where it's not just, "Yes, I like them, they're great. Hire them"?

Lauren Ipsen (00:48:11):
Especially on references, provided references, I've only had two candidates where provided references have come back negative, which that's tough. Outside of that, typically references are a standard. It is important to dig pretty deep and ask the hard questions.

Lenny (00:48:28):
What's the hard questions?

Lauren Ipsen (00:48:29):
Yeah, why would I not hire this person? What are their biggest weaknesses? And then if they give you the typical, "Oh, if they work too hard," it's like, no, tell me more. What are their actual weaknesses? What are things that we should be really cognizant of? Would you hire this person again? Would you report to this person? Would you endorse this person if you knew that your name was attached to it? Things like that I think get people thinking, and even if you just sense the slightest pause, that in itself will be enough to make you think twice. Right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:49:04):
So it's a lot of reading the room and probing harder than you think necessary, which is tough. But back channel references I think will always provide a greater source of truth than provided. It's similar to an Instagram Reel as opposed to the photos you're tagged in. That's the way I think of it. It's like this is what you want the world to see or think of you as, and then these are what your peers and your direct reports and the people around you actually say about the work that you did during this time.

Lenny (00:49:33):
Awesome. Coming back to a point you made about recruiter training 101, you learn how to find patterns and red flags in people's resume. What else is a red flag in your resume that you want to avoid/there's a rule of thumb of like, if you're at a place for less than a year, it's bad. Is that true? How do you feel about that? How do hiring managers generally feel about that?

Lauren Ipsen (00:49:53):
It definitely depends, with regards to being at a place less than a year. If that's a recurring theme, of course that's a big red flag. Even if it's happened two or three times, three definitely. If it's happened twice, it's like, "Huh, that feels off." You got to let people tell their story though and their side of things, and again, it comes back to reaching out to different people and understanding if what they're saying is true was actually the truth. And so when you have a really good pulse on what's happening in tech and whether there was a riff and the reason that person was let go was actually because they weren't prioritizing a certain part of the product or whatever, like those things, it happens. That's life, especially right now, right? If we were to X every single person that has a short stint that joined a new company over the course of the past year, that wouldn't do anyone any good.

Lauren Ipsen (00:50:44):
Another thing I've found that's pretty interesting is that people will often, because they're so afraid of that narrative, they'll often not include on their resume companies that they didn't stay for a year. And in my personal opinion, that's actually almost more of a red flag because that did happen, and you don't want to just pretend like that wasn't a decision you made in your life, and usually is handled with grace. You can speak to the reason that you decided to make a bet, the reason that you went there, and the reason that you moved on, in a way that people can typically resonate with. But I've seen executives just put that they've simply been advising for two years or something like that, when in reality they had two companies that failed.

Lauren Ipsen (00:51:33):
And the fact of the matter is, I have some CFO candidates I'm talking to right now and their past three years have been short stints because they were brought in to take a company through an IPO and then that changed, or they were brought in to enter into a SPAC and then that became less of the buzz. Right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:51:51):
So these things happen and roles change, and I think it's just allowing people to tell their story is the most important thing. So I would say red flag is, for me, just always be honest about when you started, when you left a company. If I see that someone still has present on their LinkedIn but they've been gone for two years and they kind of are acting like they're still there, that doesn't feel good. Just want people to give you the truth, the straight facts, so that you can support them and tell their story and represent them in a way that makes you feel like you have all the details.

Lenny (00:52:23):
Got it. So basically, don't lie. That makes sense. That reminds me a little bit of people kind of upgrade their titles a little bit because maybe they don't have an official title or they just want to sound a little important. How do you feel about when people do that on their resumes?

Lauren Ipsen (00:52:35):
Yeah, I don't love that. I also don't love on the resume when people, and some people do this and it's okay, but when people say silly, vague names like they'll say something along the lines of, "Whatever at Reddit," as their title or, "Master of blank at this," and it's like, okay, what were you actually doing?

Lenny (00:52:58):
But I think they do that to avoid recruiters reaching out to them.

Lauren Ipsen (00:53:00):
Exactly. As their direct target, I'm pissed. So I feel directly attacked in that regard. So that's something that throws me off, but that could definitely be a personal thing. And I think overall, for the most part, people don't have any other things that really just throw me for a loop. And the fact of the matter is, resumes we look at less and less, especially at the executive level, and it's a lot more of allowing people to tell their story, meeting in person, talking with their different people that support them, and getting kind of more of the big picture around who they are.

Lenny (00:53:33):
I want to talk about what recruiters often do wrong and what you've learned there. But before we get there, one last question: do you have any tips for a product manager in the interviewing process, how to be more successful interviewing?

Lauren Ipsen (00:53:45):
I've had this come up a few times when I've interviewed product folks that they'll speak down on their counterparts or say that the reason they weren't able to meet deadlines or push product in the right way was because of the engineering team or because of other components of the business and it wasn't them. And so I think that's never a good way to go about it. So it seems obvious, but you would be surprised how not obvious it is.

Lauren Ipsen (00:54:10):
So thinking about things more holistically, speaking honestly about your strengths and things that you want to continue to grow and improve upon, and then being able to tell your story, like practice telling your story. So often people don't do that, especially when they're not looking for jobs, and then it's not until their 10th interview that they know how to tell their story and what they did and what they impacted and why they were someone to be missed when they moved on. Those are things that you want to know how to speak to, and unless it's something you've been doing or practicing, it's less natural. That's some advice I think just off the top of the head.

Lenny (00:54:45):
Awesome. That's really good advice. One thing that makes me think about, I know I want to get to this last section, but do you think the best product leaders have their kind of story figured out in the future and work backwards from that and have a sense of where they want to end up, or just kind of take it as it goes? Because I'm the latter. I had no plan, I just went to see ... follow the path that was presented. Do you think that is generally true for folks that end up being successful, or do you recommend people think about, "Here's where I want to be in five years, here's what I need to do to get there"? Do you have any guidance there?

Lauren Ipsen (00:55:18):
I mean, for what it's worth, I'm definitely more with you. I don't know where I want to be in five years, so it's tough for me to say. But I do think that typically someone that has the end goal of being a CEO will put the pieces into place to try and get there, and so it's not a bad idea if you do have an end goal of wanting to run your own thing to inch towards that. So maybe you go from being a product specific leader to then operating in some type of GM of a business unit capacity and owning a P&L, and then although it's more of a product oriented role, you're still getting closer and closer to that end goal of COO or CEO.

Lauren Ipsen (00:55:53):
So if it's something like that, then I think that naturally makes sense. Do think people can be enticed by shiny objects, so excited because it's a step up from a title perspective and things like that, and I think that's just so not important in the grand scheme of things. You could be the VP of product or a CPO of what, you know? That's so vague. If someone just says, "I want to be a chief product officer, that's the end goal," I always say, "Of what?" You could be the chief product officer of your household. Is it of a multi-billion dollar consumer brand or ...

Lauren Ipsen (00:56:32):
So I guess what I'm trying to say is work backwards from a goal for sure, but don't allow titles or valuation bubbles or other things to derail something that feels good. If you're in a role and you feel like you're making an impact and you're learning and you're growing and are excited about the work you're doing, do not allow a title of some other company to make you feel like what you're doing isn't worthwhile.

Lenny (00:57:01):
I love that advice. So many people just chase some fancy new role, new title, new logo, and end up getting there like, "Man, this sucks."

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:08):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:57:09):
This reminds me, I did a meditation retreat once and one of the teachings there was you don't want to be fixated with achieving a specific thing, but you want to push your cart in that direction, just like head that direction and have a general sense, but not, "I need to be that thing and that's what'll make me happy."

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:26):
Exactly. I think that's exactly right.

Lenny (00:57:27):
Awesome. Okay. Final topic is from the recruiter perspective, what do you find recruiters do wrong most often or miss when they're trying to attract great product talent to a company?

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:38):
Yeah, so this is one I feel especially passionate about because I do think recruiters have a bit of a reputation, and I think that it's for some good reason. There's naturally people that forget that these are human beings that we're dealing with every single day that have lives, have families, have careers, or ambitions outside of their career.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:01):
So I think it's essential that you remember that this is another human being on the other end of things and that you should treat them with the same level of respect that you would expect to be treated.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:15):
This has become even more apparent now that I have gone through some of my own recruiting cycles where I was looking for different jobs, and a transactional recruiting call just will rub you so the wrong way and will make you want to put things on your resume like I just alluded to that say things like, "Whatever at Reddit," or what have you because you just don't want to deal with it.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:36):
And so I think you have to be a human, you have to start with a relationship, find common ground, build rapport, listen to people, like actually listen, and remember what they say. So if someone says, "I never want to do a crypto company," and I just am only shoving crypto companies down their throat, that's just insanely tone deaf. Or if they say, "I have this vest that I really want to be around for in May of next year," and I just keep hitting them up prior to that, that's just so not receptive to what they just said.

Lauren Ipsen (00:59:12):
Things like that, make notes if easier, because we speak to so many people all day long so it's definitely not easy to do. But I'll have a note on my calendar that John Kim's vest just happened in March, and then I'll be like, "Oh, okay, might be a good time for me to catch up." I won't say, "Congrats on the recent vest." I'll say, "You want to grab a coffee, or do you want to catch up about this?" Or, "Hey, I saw that you were speaking at this conference, love what you spoke about with regards to this." You got to find ways to connect with people outside of just shoving them into a job.

Lauren Ipsen (00:59:46):
And so I would say something that I've learned and become very good at is starting with a foundation of relationship building, gaining trust from people, because once you have that, then people will hear you out on jobs and people will listen to you and actually trust your advice from a career direction and perspective, but that takes time to build that, and it's definitely not going to be built by just chucking things at the wall and seeing what sticks with people and seeing where you can shove them temporarily. In fact, that will make them lose trust. And once you lose trust in a candidate, it's impossible to get it back.

Lenny (01:00:22):
It's interesting how one of the recurring themes of our chat so far is just play the long game in every way, which takes more time.

Lauren Ipsen (01:00:28):
Yes.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Kind of sucks that you have to put in all this time ahead of time before you really need to get something done, but what you keep coming back to is just that's how you end up being successful as a recruiter, as a product leader, as a hiring manager, as a founder.

Lauren Ipsen (01:00:39):
A million percent. Yeah. Yeah. And it's really easy when you've got a quota to hit and you've got people to provide for and a mortgage to just think about the numbers, but you have to play the long game because people aren't just a commodity. It's so much more.

Lenny (01:00:56):
And one of the perks of working with a recruiter is they have done that already for you, and so I was going to ask, when does it make sense for a founder to engage with a recruiter like yourself and when should they not?

Lauren Ipsen (01:01:08):
Engaging with recruiters sooner rather than later in a proactive way is always a positive thing. It's just sometimes companies aren't at the stage where they can necessarily hire a full-time recruiter because of resources and how expensive it is to bring in an exec recruiter.

Lauren Ipsen (01:01:26):
So having someone that you can bounce things off of in a more informal capacity, bringing in someone like a talent advisor that can help in a consultative way, those types of things, a million percent. Leaning into the venture firms that have backed you, which is a lot of what I'm doing right now, that is definitely areas in which early CEO founders should be leaning into that and trying to get as knowledgeable as possible. And then I would say typically series B feels ... series A, dependent on the check size, and then series B feels like a good time to bring in a couple key big players, if the company's well positioned to do so.

Lenny (01:02:06):
And bring in meaning full-time in-house recruiters or a firm?

Lauren Ipsen (01:02:09):
Probably bring in a firm. Yeah. That would be my recommendation. I think you can bring in one or two recruiters in the early days like seed, if it makes sense for the company and they're growing quickly, but it's all kind of case to case.

Lenny (01:02:22):
The fact that you're kind of off the table for most founders now that you're at GC, which is a part ... And is that true? Like you basically at this point work for General Catalyst founders, is that correct?

Lauren Ipsen (01:02:32):
I am supporting all of our GC founders in the consumer and crypto portfolio. That being said, I spend all day every single day networking and chatting with amazing entrepreneurs, people that could be founding a company down the road and need some advice, great people that want to help in an advising capacity. So it is, I would say, 50% networking, 50% actual parachuting into portfolio.

Lenny (01:03:00):
Got it. Okay.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:01):
Supporting them.

Lenny (01:03:01):
That's cool. I didn't know that part.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:03):
So outside of that, what do you suggest founders look for when they're looking for a recruiter, and the second to last question, what are signs that this is a good firm, a good recruiter? Just what should you be looking for when you're looking to hire a recruiter, either in house or a firm?

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:15):
I think it's important to provide them with some direction and then see if they can recite it back to you. Tell them the types of things you're looking for and then say, "Did that resonate? Because I'd love to hear from you what you took away from that and what you think we should be looking for."

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:32):
And then kind of off the bat, ask them for a couple candidate ideas. Don't give them time to just go call other people. In real time, ask them for some candidate ideas. Where does their brain go? Who are people they would call tomorrow on this? The more that you can get that dynamic relationship formed before you even go to search, the more you can determine whether this is someone you want to calibrate with.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:54):
So yeah, I think just putting them on the spot a little bit and asking them to show their work rather than just sending over a deck of searches that could have been done by other partners or could have just been done by other people on their team. You want to actually understand who this person is. So that first question is testing their listening skills and their ability to actually hear what you're saying and what you're looking for, and then the second is, okay, now how quickly can we get calibrated on what this profile should look like.

Lenny (01:04:21):
Awesome. That is great advice. Very tactical. Any final words or wisdom before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lauren Ipsen (01:04:26):
This has been awesome, by the way. I think more generally, the advice is just treat people like human beings, build rapport, play the long game, and gain trust, and that takes time. And so those are the most important things from a recruiting standpoint, is being able to tap people and have them feel like you genuinely have their best interest at heart and that you care about their career and life outside their career. And so I think that's what makes for a really good recruiter.

Lenny (01:04:53):
Simple advice, but often forgotten and easy to overlook. Awesome. All right. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to give you six questions, whatever comes to mind, we'll go through them real fast. Does that sound good?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:08):
Okay. Yes. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:05:10):
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:14):
The Power of Now and You Are Here.

Lenny (01:05:17):
Wow. Awesome. What are favorite other podcasts that you listen to other than this one?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:22):
I mean, there's tech ones, but Your Own Backyard because I went to Cal Poly, so that one hits a little close to home.

Lenny (01:05:28):
Wow, I haven't heard of that. Cool. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've watched that you've enjoyed?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:34):
Top Gun I've watched too many times and-

Lenny (01:05:39):
The new Top Gun.

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:39):
Yeah. And then TV show. Oh, it's all trash reality, so I just can't tell you.

Lenny (01:05:45):
I get that. I understand. My wife has that and she can't tell anyone. Yeah.

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:51):
That's my one secret.

Lenny (01:05:51):
All right. Okay, great. We'll move on, but that's great. What's a favorite ... Oh, this is interesting. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask or maybe you've seen someone ask?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:01):
I love the good strengths and weaknesses question. I think it's really good to see how people self-analyze themselves.

Lenny (01:06:06):
What do you look for in their answer that's the sign that it's well answered?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:10):
Honesty, authenticity. Can read right through a, "Work too hard," answer or a perfectionist type answer. What are your weaknesses? Let's talk about it.

Lenny (01:06:19):
For real.

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:21):
So that one I think is always a really good test of character.

Lenny (01:06:24):
What are some favorite apps right now?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:27):
I've been playing around on BeReal. I mean, I love Spotify, it's straightforward. And then I've been on Strava, I've been running, so that are the-

Lenny (01:06:34):
That's a good combination of apps. That's like a full life.

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:37):
Thank you. Thanks so much. Trying to be.

Lenny (01:06:41):
Final question. Who else in the industry would you say that you most respect as a leader and a thought leader influence type person?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:49):
My first boss out of college, Joe Suliman, is awesome. He's always taught me to lead with that relationship-based approach and it's really so easy to say that you do that, but then to actually do it and live it out for the people that work for you, as well as the people that are in industry and speak of you, is something else. And so he's always taught me to do that, and I just learned a ton from him and he's just incredibly smart and in tune with what's happening in industry and makes great stances and opinions on how to navigate those types of things. So, he's someone that I have an immense amount of respect for.

Lenny (01:07:24):
Sounds like an amazing person. Lauren, this was excellent. I feel like this is going to be useful to so many people, product managers, founders, other recruiters, all kinds of other people. Thank you so much for doing this and making the time. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or maybe collaborate with you and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lauren Ipsen (01:07:44):
Yes, absolutely. And also, thank you. This has been so much fun. They can reach out to me on LinkedIn. I happen to be on that one quite a bit, so definitely can DM me there, can send me an email, and I can shoot you that over as well. And then the way they can be helpful is if there's people that they think the world of, shoot them my way. If they have questions around best ways to go through an interview process or how to navigate different things, please, by all means, a huge part of my job is trying to help people that are going through this for the first time. Happy to just be a sounding board or of help in any capacity.

Lenny (01:08:19):
So if you're an awesome product leader, you want to see what's out there, find Lauren on LinkedIn. Is that the best place to find you?

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:24):
That's perfect.

Lenny (01:08:25):
All right. Awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:25):
Yep.

Lenny (01:08:25):
Thanks, Lauren.

# Gain attention as an underdog with this framework | Lulu Cheng Meservey

## Transcript

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:00:00):
I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:00:33):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:01:18):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Lulu Meservey. I met Lulu while she was head of comms at Substack, where she was infamous for taking big risks and bold stands, and as a result creating a lot of attention for Substack, and other companies she's represented. Lulu is definitely the most innovative and interesting comms person I've worked with.

(00:01:46):
She's currently executive vice president of corporate affairs and chief communications officer at Activision Blizzard. And she writes what I'd say is the best newsletter on PR and comms strategy, a newsletter called Flack. In our conversation we get tactical about how to make your idea spread, cultural erogenous zones, the growing importance of going direct versus relying on traditional media. The importance of taking risks in your comms and much more. Lulu is so insightful, I could have continued to explore the subject for hours. Enjoy this episode with Lulu Meservey after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about AssemblyAI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs. They recently launched Conformer-1, the largest trained speech recognition model on the market which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. All of AssemblyAI's models, which are accessed through their API are production ready.

(00:02:54):
So many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI, and AssemblyAI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases. Now is the time to check out AssemblyAI with their new Conformer-1 model available today, which makes it even easier to bring the highest accuracy transcription to your customers just like Spotify, CallRail and Writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground, that's assemblyai.com/lenny.

(00:03:28):
This episode is brought to you by Public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash, that is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high, but buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, and you can access your cash whenever you want even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield.

(00:04:10):
Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity, so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury account at public.com/lenny. Lulu welcome to the podcast.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:04:39):
Thank you Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:41):
I am really excited to chat all things comms and PR. I've never met a founder or product leader who doesn't want to get better at spreading ideas and getting their product out there, and you're very good at this. We're going to talk about some of the things you've done in the space. But just to start maybe just broadly I'm curious to hear just what have you learned about what helps an idea spread?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:05:03):
So there's a few ways to make the idea spread, the overall principle is you have to make it memorable and you have to make people want to say it of their own volition. And so what doesn't make them want to say it is doing a favor for a corporation. What does make them want to say it is they want to bring joy to somebody else, they want to make somebody laugh, they want to appear interesting, or they want to project some part of their identity. And so a few things that you can do with an idea to make it spread better, you can make it into a joke, so you can turn it into a line that people will repeat. You can use an analogy, you can take something and just say it over and over, move fast and break things, don't be evil, build something people want.

(00:05:47):
You can create a mental image that is very colorful. So I have a mental image for people that I use a lot, which is put the pill in some cheese and we can talk about it later, it's about how to craft a story that will stick. But when I say put the pill in cheese, people tend to remember that and it's more easily repeatable. And then the last thing is use a story, use an anecdote instead of using adjectives because adjectives are so subjective, they're meaningless to people. So if you give them a story that's something they can repeat over the dinner table.

Lenny (00:06:17):
Do you have any examples of the frameworks you just shared? So you talked about maybe having an analogy or putting the pill in the cheese, which I think is referring to when you feed a dog a pill. You want to hide the pill in the cheese. Is there any stories or examples that come to mind of this in action either something you've done or other companies you've seen?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:06:34):
One example not for the better is binders of women. You remember when Mitt Romney said binders of women and it just absolutely caught on like wildfire, and it's because you can picture the binder, it's a hilarious mental image. You make lots of jokes about it. It's a very specific unusual phrasing that is very repeatable, and it lends itself so much to memeing. So it's not something that they wanted to have happen, which is a word of caution, this can backfire on you as well, but that's an example. I mentioned move fast and break things, software is eating the world, it's time to build. Those are these short phrases that take normal words and put them in an unusual order, and then especially if you repeat them a few times they just become very sticky.

Lenny (00:07:19):
These things sound really smart and wise after the fact, do you have any advice on just how to... So we're talking about coming up with a cool phrase that'll spread of how to do that. I don't know what have you seen work for coming up with move fast and break things, how would a founder approach that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:07:35):
You want to make it something that a second-grader could understand. You want to minimize the cognitive burden on the recipient. So it should be something where they're not having to expend any extra energy understanding the thing, where it immediately paints a picture. Or if you were to make a joke, it has to be a joke that they immediately get, or it's a very widely understood reference. You don't want it to be this inside joke with yourself that other people might get if you explain it to them. So if you were to boil down the essence of let's say your company or your mission, get it to one sentence and then turn it into a sentence that you could explain to a second-grader, and then cleanse it of all cliches and common parlance. And if you can then turn that into an analogy or if you can make it into something that has imagery, then you're probably 80, 90% of the way there.

Lenny (00:08:36):
So you've definitely done this on Twitter. It might be fun just to share a tweet or something of yours that has done this that has spread like crazy. I noticed you delete your old tweets, which I think is really smart and I should probably do that. So I couldn't find any examples, but I remember just being like, "Holy shit, it's got a bazillion views." Is there there an example that comes to mind that you could share? Just share something you put out that just went crazy.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:09:00):
I actually have a negative example too. I think it's useful to share my mistakes or missteps in addition to what went right, because there's more mistakes and missteps than what goes right. In general, you try a bunch of things every once in a while they succeed. But I think it's useful to think about what didn't land. And so one of mine was when you might remember this because this was the Substack era, when we were taking a lot of incoming for not censoring enough, and we took a stand that we want to encourage free expression. I was actually on maternity leave, so I was a little bit out of the loop, but I wanted to jump in there and support the cause. And so I did a thread about why we're standing by this principle even when it's hard, and the thread was pretty well received, it traveled a lot.

(00:09:53):
I think it was 30 something thousand likes among people that we cared about, people who write on the internet. And then there was one tweet in the thread where I said something like, "Doing this isn't pleasant, but neither for that matter is the sea." Completely esoteric reference, it was fresh in my mind because it was from a New Yorker book review where in that context it was poetic and evocative and beautiful. And I did the thing you're not supposed to do, which is take an inside joke with yourself and release it into the world.

(00:10:33):
And that one tweet was a dud in the middle of the thread where you could see the likes drop off precipitously and people were like, "What are you talking about?" And then afterwards I looked at it with fresh eyes, "Yeah, this makes no sense whatsoever out of a context." And also I'm not a New York book reviewer, so that was a good don't. But the fact that it was such a colorful metaphor actually caught people's attention in an accidental way. I didn't mean for it too. I guess that's a don't, does that serve as an example?

Lenny (00:11:08):
Yeah, that'll work and we'll go through other examples. But that's a good segue to something I was going to save for later, but it may be a good time to chat about is just something that you're big on is this concept of taking risks as a comms person, I think you have the sense that comms people are just very conservative, and there's a big opportunity to get a little out there. And in this case maybe it didn't work out, other times you have and it has. So just talk about that philosophy you have around taking risks.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:11:34):
I think if you're a startup your enemy is the status quo. And when you don't take risks, when you minimize risk by doing nothing, the best way to minimize risk is to do nothing. You're letting the status quo win. You're letting your greatest enemy and rival and threat to your business win by default, because you're not even going to try to compete. And so I always encourage people to try to make mistakes of commission rather than omission. Because if you make a mistake of commission you can observe it, you can learn from it. You know right away that it's happened. You can move really quickly and adapt and become better.

(00:12:11):
Whereas if you make mistakes of omission you're letting status quo win, you're not observing, you're not learning, and you're maybe not even noticing opportunities slip by. So the example that I use, again, an analogy to make it more memorable, my analogy for this is if you are investing money in the market versus if you're just sitting in cash. If you're sitting in cash you won't lose your money and it feels safe. But over time the world moves and the market grows, and everybody else is getting richer and you're getting poorer in real terms. Whereas if you make an investment it'll go up and down, there'll be some volatility. It's not just going to go up every day, but over the long run you'll be much, much better off.

Lenny (00:12:54):
Is there an example of something you did that you took a risk and it worked out, or you saw someone else do this really well?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:13:00):
The stand for free speech thread would be a risk that worked out. It was a risk because it was a topic that a lot of people were already mad about, which will happen with every topic that matters. It felt a little risky for me because I was on leave, I wasn't really in the middle of things. I was addled already, so I had at least one thing in there that was nonsensical. So there was the execution risk of would I'd be able to do this well.

(00:13:29):
There was also the risk of you poke your head up and make a thing where there wasn't a thing, and if that were to go wrong and embarrass the company or if that had made Chris or Hamish or Jerraj upset, that would've been upsetting to me and obviously a failure of my job. So that was a risk that I took and we took and they were supportive, and it did work out because the people who were most likely to write on Substack generally appreciate that stance.

(00:14:00):
I actually have one more for you Lenny when you asked about what are things that help stick in people's memory, there was the fail example of the sea analogy. I think a useful example that works is I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones, and it is something that you immediately know what I'm talking about. If I say know your audience's cultural erogenous zones, you know what it means, it's a shorthand that everybody understands. It's not an inside joke with myself, and it's something that is unusual and upraising that you're going to repeat it and hopefully remember it, so there's one for you.

Lenny (00:14:40):
You told me about that framework and I definitely wanted to hear more about it. What does that mean and is there something that you've seen someone do that's just like, "Wow, they really nailed this erogenous zone approach."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:14:54):
Yeah, they really got it in the erogenous bull bullseye. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:15:26):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:16:09):
This makes me think about one of the other tweets that I think went crazy, which is where you share the things you're muting on Twitter. Where it's like the threads thimble and the pointing down thing, and it feels like that's exactly that where people are just like, "Yep, this is me."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:16:25):
Yeah, it is that. I have an example for you Lenny. The one that my mind goes to is when Kamala Harris was running for Senate. Put aside what anyone thinks of Kamala Harris as a politician or if you agree with her politics, it doesn't matter. When she was running for Senate, she had this example where not enough people care about K-12 education. It's not a sexy topic and only moms care about it, whereas people cared a lot and still do about national defense, national security.

(00:16:55):
And so she said the way to get their attention is you go to people who care about national security and you tell them, "Did you know that in order to enlist for the army you have to have a 10th grade reading level?" If you can't read at that level, you're not going to be able to read the army field manual. And so if you care about the future of national defense and being able to maintain a standing army, you need to care about middle grade reading standards. So that's a perfect example, and in fact it stuck with me such that many years later I'm still repeating it to you.

Lenny (00:17:28):
Something else that I think what you teach helps with is underdogs coming up against incumbent companies, giving them a chance to stand out. Like Substack I think is a good example where you just helped elevate Substack on the world stage in a lot of ways. What have you found works best for underdog startups and companies trying to get attention?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:17:49):
First, you have to acknowledge that you're the underdog, and you're not going to use the GE playbook from the 1980s or whatever. So acknowledging that means knowing that you're not going to play the game that requires you to have more resources, more and deeper relationships, and institutional backings, and to be able to draft off of the current narrative. So all of those things are going to be not in your favor. If you're a startup for example, by definition you're trying to disrupt something, you're trying to do something differently, you're fighting the status quo. And if that's the case then you can't rely on maybe the government, maybe mainstream media to support what you're doing. And so you should assume that you want to go with an approach that doesn't require a lot of money or people, that doesn't require that institutional backing and those relationships.

(00:18:40):
That means building your own distribution, which you can do starting from day one. You can start doing that before you even have the company. It means taking your story and winning hearts and minds. Number one, by making it a story that you shape to fit people's cultural erogenous zones of your audience. And number two, by finding the centers of gravity in society, like the influencers that are going to help spread it for you. Because you're not going to on day one call up the New York Times and get them to print the story that you want them to. So you need to figure out who are the influencers and the way to do that, I'll cut off the rabbit hole after this because you can just go deeper and deeper, but the way to do that is in concentric circles. There's a general who said if there's a problem I look for it in concentric circles going back to my own desk.

(00:19:33):
If you want to spread something you go out in concentric circles starting from your own desk. So you need to get first really clear with yourself about what your message is and just get really crisp with it. This is hard to do because you know too much, so out of the 1,000 facts in your head you're going to have to pick just between one and three. And then the next circle is going to be your co-founders, your executives, your employees, your investors, you go to your power users, and you go out from there, and it has to be in that sequence.

(00:20:06):
But once you get the sequence and you identify who the people are and you know who your audience is, and then you're able to hone in on what their cultural erogenous zones are, then you're able to craft the message, have the delivery mechanisms, and then know your target, and then you're off. But you just need to do that exercise upfront, so you don't have a lot of wasted motion.

Lenny (00:20:25):
I really like this concentric circle framework. I haven't heard this before. Just to make it a little more real is there something that you can share, something that comes to mind that illustrates that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:20:36):
Well, you and I have talked a lot about Substack, so I'm speaking out of term now that I don't have the employee badge. But something that I thought the Substack founders have always done so well is propagate product updates out in concentric circles. So there's a lot of things where you're going to know about it. You, Lenny will know about it more than a new writer who just joined, because you're a power user of the product and they would want you... Now they would want to make sure that you love the thing, and that you feel maybe even a little bit invested in the thing. You've been telling people about recommendations for nearly a year. No one asked you to do that. We didn't pay you to do that. You've done it because you were brought on board early and it was something that the company made sure that you liked, and then you became the next circle out that spread it to your next circle out.

Lenny (00:21:33):
It's interesting because I didn't think of it as an intentional strategy to get news out, and it feels like there's a synergy with just talking to your power users. Getting feedback from your power users leads to this interesting second order effect where they also want to... they feel like they're on the inside of something, they want to share it and maybe talk about it and tell friends about, "Hey, Substack's working this cool thing." So that's kind of a cool-

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:21:53):
Well, early on Lenny you asked about how do you get a message to spread? And I said you give people incentives who want to spread it. So your incentive was you helping others, you like paying it forward and helping other writers and podcasters, and you genuinely enjoy the thing. And I think there's some value to your own project that you get to show social proof that a lot of people like this thing and it's growing, and that's what you got. If it had been like, "Hey, Lenny, can you do us a favor and tweet this thing?" You might've done it, but you would've done it once and stopped and it wouldn't have been something that you organically keep doing.

Lenny (00:22:30):
To make this even more real I'm trying to help people understand this concentric circle idea, so first Substack is an example. What would be the few layers of the concentric circle on the middle would be maybe the power writers. What would be the next couple layers?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:22:46):
It's the employees at the middle, almost always, and then it is depending on the company. So here it would be the power writers, it's youth, a lot of the original writers. Bill Bishop comes up a lot, he was Substacker number one, he's always really meaningful. And then it's fast growing writers. It is writer influencers. There are certain members of the media that cover media and writing, and so they matter a lot. And then investors are in there just to keep close to the fold.

(00:23:18):
But if you're a different kind of company that might be employees board, institutional investors, government and regulators then users, just depending on how much power each group has to influence your future. And the reason I say go out in concentric circles as opposed to just hit each of these groups kind of haphazardly is that's your way to control the message. Because each circle is going to assume that the inner circle knows better than them and they're going to follow the lead of the inner circle. So an example is if you and I have a company, Lenny and Lulu, this is a DTC startup.

Lenny (00:24:01):
That's a great name.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:02):
It is, we should do it.

Lenny (00:24:03):
We should do this.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:04):
If we had a company and we were trying to put out a message to the world that our new thing works, it's really revolutionary, our genes are the best genes. If employees are not saying that, then people are going to look at employees and say, "Well, they would know, they're closer to this than we are. So if they're not excited then why would we be excited?" And so that undermines everything that we're trying to do, you can't skip a circle is my point.

Lenny (00:24:32):
Super interesting. And I imagine the closer they are to the employees the more time you spend with them, and the more innately they're closer and also their perspective and what they share is more powerful because they're closer to what's happening.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:48):
And if it goes wrong the more damage they can do. So on the spectrum it's if they are not totally on board and they're not an effective messenger, versus they're just lukewarm and they're not really sure they believe it. All the way to they actively fell off the bandwagon and you lost them, and now they're out there proactively contradicting everything you say or even trying to destroy the company, that can happen. If an early employee, for example, feels disgruntled, which is easy to do and it's easy to do through a comms mistake. If you sell them on one thing and here's a vision, and now either that's changed or you miscommunicated. If they feel like there's a bait and switch they're going to be really mad. And now you've created someone who is incredibly credible and has the same social and professional circle as you and is trying to ruin you.

Lenny (00:25:44):
That's such a good point. For someone that's trying to do this maybe internally they're like, "Oh, cool, we got to create these circles for our startup." What do you recommend they do? Do they make a list of here's our inner circle, here's the next circle of people.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:25:56):
Yeah, you take out your one-page Google Doc. I feel like most comms problems can be solved with one-page Google Doc. So you go to your one-page Google Doc and you take your audiences, you list them, probably stop at five or six because past that it's like way, way first world problem. You'll have more than enough work to win over the five or six inner circles, and then you have to rank them. And you rank them by how much they're able to influence your success and how much credibility other groups assign them. So then you have your inner to outer circles.

(00:26:32):
And then for each of them you would think about what do they care about that's their cultural erogenous zones and where do they reside intellectually? So do they listen to podcasts, if so, which ones. Do they go to in-person conferences? Are they getting all of their news from Reddit? If so, which subreddits are they on Hacker News? Once you map that out, then again you have the people you're trying to reach, the ideas and messages that resonate the most with them, and then the ways to actually reach them.

Lenny (00:27:04):
This is becoming a real template we can start using. In the bucket of erogenous zones what are some examples of erogenous zones for people in this context?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:27:15):
We've talked about the free expression stand from last year. A lot of people care about first amendment, protecting press freedoms and free expression. Not a lot of people care that a journalist said something mean about Substack. And so there were a few times when we did have to push back publicly against a journalist saying something mean and unfair or untrue about Substack. So obviously my and our ulterior motive is to vindicate the company and show people that this isn't true. But if we had just done that, nobody would've cared or maybe a few diehards would've cared. There are people who care deeply about Substack, but not as many people and not as deeply as the people who care about their ability to express themselves freely or their right to build their own media platform without too many controls.

Lenny (00:28:20):
The way you described it earlier came back to me as you were talking, which is this idea that lights people up. What lights people up within this list of people that you're making? So that's really interesting. So the idea is create this list of people across circles further and further away from your employees. Think about what lights them up, what are their erogenous zones intellectually, and then think about where they spend their time intellectually, what are they listening to? What are they reading?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:44):
Yeah, that's it.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Amazing, this is super cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:47):
It's not easy, it's hard, you have to make very difficult tactical decisions every day when you're doing that, but it is simple.

Lenny (00:28:54):
Yeah, it seems pretty easy. Okay, this is great. Another framework that we haven't talked about yet, do you have this math formula for how ideas spread? Does that ring a bell?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:05):
Okay, let's get into that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:06):
I think it's useful to try to bring as much discipline as possible to comms, because you're really just measuring vibes. In a world of OKRs and data and metrics it's hard to know if you're doing the right thing with comms. And so I think whenever you're able to establish a framework its useful, so this one is kind of a mathematical formula of comms for a purpose. It assumes that you have a business goal and as a business goal, not communications goal, it's not get this many impressions or go viral or blah. It is we're going to grow our revenue by X, or we're going to make this penetration into this user base. When you have your business goal you're going to need certain people to do certain things for that goal to come true. So for example, you're going to need this type of person in this quantity to buy these sneakers in order for you to meet your revenue goal.

(00:30:07):
So now you know who the people are and the action they need to take. The next step is what do they need to believe in order to take that action? So they need to believe that their feet are not comfortable now, and that it's possible for their feet to be more comfortable and that'll have a positive effect on their life, and that this new sneaker technology is real, so they need to believe these things. Then it's where do they reside intellectually? How do you deliver that message to them, and that's the who do they listen to? Which accounts do they follow? Which podcast do they... what trips do they take? What newspapers, et cetera. And when you have that then you have the equation of we need to deliver this message to these people through these mediums in order to get them to do this thing with this call to action. And that way you know that you're at least pushing forward and getting something done with your comms as opposed to just saying words into the ether.

Lenny (00:31:11):
I think you had something like there's pressure and force and area, is that part of this or is that a different framework?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:17):
Different framework.

Lenny (00:31:18):
Oh, okay, cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:20):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:31:21):
Okay, okay, let's talk about this other framework too.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:24):
I've got more frameworks, Lenny.

Lenny (00:31:25):
I love it, this is what this podcast is all about. Let's do it.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:29):
This is a useful one for early stage startups especially, or anybody who's just trying to be lean and efficient, which is anyone who's an underdog like we talked about earlier, that if you decrease the surface area than with the same amount of force you can apply more pressure. So the amount of pressure is the force divided by the surface area, this is a basic equation for physics, but it's also true of communications, which is if you decrease the surface area and don't try to appeal to everybody with everything. And you're targeting exactly whom you're talking to and you are sharpening your message to a point, to get them in the bullseye of the cultural erogenous zone. Then you're able to with the same amount of effort or expense or time, you're able to make more of an impact, you're able to apply more pressure.

(00:32:30):
So I think of it as there's a continuum between you can either hyper-target, so the extreme of the continuum is you are becoming the life partner of one person. That's the ultra hyper targeting. And then the other end of the spectrum is you're appealing to everybody. You're appealing to a larger number of people, but with a weaker message, in a weaker way. So you could say world peace is good, nobody disagrees with that practically, but also it doesn't stick and it's not meaningful to them. So you have to choose where you're going to be along that continuum. And for most startups I would choose towards the fewer people end of it, where you choose who's going to be your diehards and then you foster them and create really deep meaningful relationships with them. And the way to do that is to decrease the surface area and apply more pressure.

Lenny (00:33:23):
It feels like you did that with Substack where it was focused on people writing online, or I guess tell me is that how you thought about it Substack of here's our little focused area and we'll focus target message to that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:33:37):
That was the goal and that's actually why I started spending time on Twitter. It was a very self-loathing exercise like Hamish doesn't like the Twitter model, nor do, we would talk about this a lot and I always felt a little bit fringe being on there. And before I worked at Substack I had a sleepy account of a couple hundred followers that didn't do very much. And I realized that the people that we were trying to speak to are heavy Twitter users, whether it's media people or online writers. And so I decided I'm going to spend some time and try to build an audience and then that audience became leverage, for better or worse. I don't think we should measure people by their Twitter following, but the fact is that if you have more then journalists and writers take you a bit more seriously. And so if I was going to try to carry a message on behalf of the company, I felt like it would be more effective if I had more people.

Lenny (00:34:38):
And it worked. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

(00:35:18):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups, it's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:35:56):
Going back to this formula, pressure equals force divided by area. Basically, to increase the effectiveness of your message you can either increase the force and what is in this context force? Is it like the amount of messaging or is it the success of your message?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:36:11):
It's the amount of effort you put into it. So it's how much you are spending on this campaign or you have a limited amount of hours in the day and dollars in the bank. And so anytime you're doing something with comms, you're either paying the dollars or you're paying the time. Sometimes you're drawing down on credibility too, you have a certain amount of credibility and there are times when you just have to say, "Please trust me." You can spend that more efficiently if you focus. So instead of if you just take a simple ad campaign, instead of spending a million dollars to reach a million people, maybe you spend a $100 to reach the hundred most important people. And focus that message exactly to them so that when they see your ad they're actually going to click on it and they're actually going to forward it, and that's a much better return. And then you might end up with a million dollars worth of return, because those people were so passionate that they then became their own messengers without you even having to be involved anymore.

Lenny (00:37:12):
This is a really great framework, again, is your advice that for the smaller you are just basically reduce the area?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:21):
Yes.

Lenny (00:37:22):
And the larger you are increase that over time?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:24):
Yes. If you're just starting out, get 10 diehards and just spend all your time... You can't start out and try to win over the general public. You start out by creating a tiny, not the best analogy is one I can think of right now, a tiny monopoly. And it's the same like succeeding on Substack or creating anything on the internet. You choose what is going to be your tiny corner of the internet that you are going to just dominate entirely. And the smaller it is, the more you can dominate it and then these people that are in it become your true believers, your diehards, and they'll expand it out to the next circle and then you go from there. But if you try to win over everybody at the same time, it's a food coloring in the ocean kind of thing as opposed to food coloring in a cup.

Lenny (00:38:17):
Is there an example that comes to mind of someone that did this really well? I don't know. I know it's hard to think of just an example off the top of your head, but does anything come to mind?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:38:25):
Balaji did this really well with his book The Network State, that book was super successful. He didn't do a lot of the traditional book tour New York Times stuff. He went his own route, and I think that was really smart if you're going to put it in the setting of this framework, it's he created his own distribution channels. He didn't try to compete with the roster of Harper Collins on their turf, and when he created his own distribution channels he focuses on who are the diehards and the truth fans, and these are people that he fosters. He goes on podcasts that reach these people. He doesn't deviate from messaging to try to appeal to everybody. There are people who just will never like that guy and he is totally fine with it. So he's not watering down who he is to appeal to people who will never like him, which it's tempting for companies to do.

(00:39:17):
You hate when people are mad at you, so you try to appeal to them and then your true fans lose their passion because the thing that made you so special has now gone milk toast. So Balaji fosters his true fans and then when the book launched they propelled him to the top of the Amazon list, because they were out there evangelizing, proselytizing. You probably saw all these tweets about his book. He didn't pay anybody as far as I know. He didn't pay anybody to do that. He just shared it with the people and they wanted to show that they were into this.

Lenny (00:39:46):
That's a great example. I know that founders often worry focusing too narrowly limits their market, and it's never going to grow into anything large. In your experience do you find that that's just often not true, that there's often a much bigger opportunity than they think? Or is that just a good way to start and then you expand from there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:40:03):
It's both. If you're writing online or doing something online, the denominator is the size of the internet. You don't need to capture 80% of it. If you capture 0.01% of it, that is a great business and then you can go from there. Once you've won that then you can decide to go from there and the world is a big place. So now that everything's digital the denominator's so large that I wouldn't worry too much about the numerator. But it is also true that if you start off trying to peel to too many people, you have to water down your stuff so much that you'll never stand out. And you've written about this Lenny with how to be viral, how to be noticed, and one of the things is be remarkable. And you can't be remarkable if you're trying to appeal to so many people that you have to become the average of 500,000 people's tastes.

Lenny (00:40:57):
This is a good way to think about I think when something's not working, when you're trying to get a bunch of attention for your product and no one cares. Feels like this is one reason is just you're going too wide.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:09):
Yeah, I think that's probably the most common reason.

Lenny (00:41:14):
Maybe just thinking about diagnosing why your comms may not be working. This may be too big of a question, but just what other explanations could there be for why no one cares about what you're trying to put out?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:25):
You're doing it as a corporation instead of a person. This is another super common mistake is you're letting yourself speak like a faceless corporation because it feels like that's what you should do now. Okay, now you're a real company and now you got to do real company stuff, that means you have to issue decrees on behalf of the C corp and you don't. And it doesn't work because people don't trust institutions. People don't like corporations or at least are not passionate about them. People care about people and trust and like people, and so there's a sense of wanting to cosplay an executive and it doesn't work, it doesn't resonate. A good example of this would be Ryan Peterson at Flexport. His company, even after it got huge, he never became the generic corporate chief. He always was a person. And there are people, many, many people who became interested in Flexport because Ryan's an interesting guy. And it's not like they had a passion for logistics and freight and shipping, but he's doing something interesting. And then he became the human gateway drug for people to become interested in his company.

Lenny (00:42:40):
Yeah, absolutely. He had that crazy viral tweet about the ports and that's a really good example. Man, I was going to go in a different direction, but maybe we go to this idea of going direct. You're a big fan and Balaji is a really big fan of this too, speaking of just the importance of going direct. So maybe just talk about what does that mean and why is that important these days?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:42:58):
Well, Balaji is more go direct than me. He thinks that I'm soft in this area because I think that there's still a place for engaging with media and that it's just another tool. He's for just straight-up go direct undistilled. But I think that for everybody a 100% of the time you want going direct to be a part of what you're doing, whether it's all you're doing, or whether you're doing something else, you can't not have a direct channel. So what that actually looks like, and people say this all the time go direct. What does that actually look like to go direct? It means that the founder or executive for some very senior person has to be speaking from themselves. First person, may be first person plural, and speaking in a human voice authentically. You see them make mistakes, you see them be vulnerable, and they have to become an ambassador to the community.

(00:43:55):
If you don't have that, then you don't have a direct channel even if you have a Twitter or a Substack or whatever, it's not direct if not connected to a person because if the other side of it is a corporation there's no direct connection. And then the second thing is start building your own audience as soon as possible. You can do this alongside engaging with the media or doing traditional things. To the point of focusing your energy and decreasing the surface area, for startups I would not recommend trying to do an Instagram, a Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok. I would choose the thing that that person is the best at. So if your spokesman is going to be your CEO, which is a good default, they're going to have a dominant communication style where they're the best at being themselves. And that's important because if somebody else is ghost-writing all their stuff, it shows.

(00:44:53):
So some CEOs are better at writing long form. Some CEOs are better at doing videos. Some do better with audio or podcasts, some are better with short form. The way that Elon Musk communicates on Twitter, he's born to do Twitter. You can't picture him writing long thoughtful blog posts, it's not a thing that he does. Whereas Brian Armstrong or Hamish or Chris, they write great blog posts that are sincere and effective, and that's better than them just trying to do it only through tweets. So pick the thing that your spokesperson is the best at and then invest everything into that channel, and then build it up to a decent amount and then expand outward. Because if you try to build six or seven channels at once you're just not going to get anywhere.

Lenny (00:45:47):
I think that's such a important point. I feel like me choosing a newsletter was actually a really good choice. As much as you may not believe this I'm not a performer person, I just want to hide behind the computer and just type stuff. And the newsletters, especially during COIVD, I was like, "I just sit at home and share stuff and edit and think about it where it's like, 'Hello everyone.'" And it took me a while to get to this point of like, "Oh, I can maybe do a podcast because I've built up a little more confidence that this is useful." So I so agree with that and that's what I tell a lot of people. Just pick the platform that is most natural to you. Maybe you like talking, maybe you performing on video, maybe you just want to sit and type.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:46:24):
And that's a good point too, Lenny, because it changes over time. Just because you pick one thing doesn't mean that you're stuck with only that forever. Over time you might choose different things and I've seen founders become a lot more comfortable in front of the camera, for example, once they've done a few reps. And the other reason to know that you can just change it over time is otherwise it feels like a deterrent to getting started. Sometimes there's paralysis if I don't know which thing to choose, and so I'm either going to do a bunch of them or none of them. Go with your gut pick one and you're not wed to that forever, you can always change it down the road.

Lenny (00:46:58):
Do you think every founder needs to be on Twitter? I get this a lot from founders. Do I need to be on Twitter? I hate Twitter. What's your take?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:47:04):
No, I think a lot of founders do. If they are super mission driven, for example, that's one way that you're going to find other people that resonate with your mission and that you're going to make the case for the mission. If you're mission driven there's also a good chance that you're doing something that some people love and some people hate. And so you're going to need to be out there fighting the fight in a way. I don't mean in a pugilistic antagonistic way, but you have to defend your thing. And so I think it's important if you're mission driven. I also think it's important if your charisma is a big part of recruiting for the company. There are some companies where the founder's charisma is a big part of why people want to go work there. So Palmer Lucky and Anduril, he is magnetic to a lot of engineers and they want to go work with that guy, specifically. Whereas there are companies where people want to go work for the company and it's less important that the founder is vocal.

Lenny (00:48:02):
What's interesting I found recently is I get more traffic to my newsletter from LinkedIn than Twitter. Is that something you think about at all? Going to LinkedIn instead of Twitter feels so wrong to say, but what's your take there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:14):
Yes, if you are career related, LinkedIn will be a lot better. One, it's better because it's not such a cesspool where anything immediately becomes controversial and people fight over it in their mentions. Two, because LinkedIn is really underutilized and founders should know this, PMs should know this. LinkedIn is super underutilized because it gets a ton of eyeballs in time, but most of the content sucks. 95% of the content this is not scientific-

Lenny (00:48:49):
Seems right, seems right.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:50):
This is my might estimate. 95% of the content is people congratulating each other on work anniversaries or people saying, "I'm so proud of my team for this thing they did." And then people react out of a sense of friendship and affection or support, but actually genuinely interesting and useful content on LinkedIn is very rare. So the ratio of your competitive set of interesting content versus how much time and attention people spend on there is excellent.

Lenny (00:49:24):
That is really good advice. I'm going to throw a fishing line into the pool of examples. You talked about people doing this well, going direct. Balaji talking about Ryan Peterson and Elon obviously. Is there anyone else that's just like here check out what they're doing and could be a good model to learn from?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:49:41):
I think it's really interesting to see what Mike Solana is doing with Pirate Wires. Here's an example of why it clearly makes sense to have the founder be very active on Twitter because he is his own recruiter and spokesperson. So I think the makeup industry actually is at the forefront of this. The makeup industry is smarter than all of us in how they use social media and influencers, because they caught on very early on that people don't buy makeup to subscribe to makeup brands, that they do it because a certain celebrity or influencer or Kardashian has this nice looking eyelid and they want their eyelid to look that way.

(00:50:25):
And so going back years before the rest of us were talking about going direct, there are makeup companies that would spend $0 on marketing, and minimal efforts on press and pour all of it decreasing the surface area. Pour all of it into fostering a small roster of influencers and having them spread the message. And so I think watch makeup companies, watch consumer companies, they're doing it right, they speak with a human voice, they speak through human beings and they're fast. If there's a trend the same day they will have hopped on the trend... within an hour they're on the trend, as opposed to other industries or more traditional companies that take a few days and they route through approvals and then the opportunity's gone.

Lenny (00:51:11):
What are some makeup companies for people to check out to see what they're doing?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:51:14):
So NYX, N-Y-X, it's a division of L'Oreal. NYX is wanted the makeup companies that has, as far as I know $0 spent on marketing and all of their dollars and all of their effort spent on paying influencers. And they really out punched their weight in terms of using humans to deliver a message that contains a call to action and then selling out product. And the product will be like a normal black eyeliner. It's the most fungible thing you could possibly imagine, and that one eyeliner will be sold out at CBS's across the country for a couple weeks, because they did something right with their social media using a person.

Lenny (00:51:57):
Just a couple more questions around this going direct concept. I don't know if you actually talked about why that's important because I think we talk about this a lot, and I think people may not recognize why people find this so important these days. What's the motivation behind that with Balaji and other founders?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:52:14):
There's two reasons it's important, there's the offense and the defense of it. The defense of it is going back to having the underdog, the insurgency mentality. If you're trying to do something different that goes against the grain, people are going to attack you. Not everyone's going to like it. And the point is that not everyone should like it, but you need a way to stand up for yourself because you don't have the big institutions and power structures that are going to do that work for you because you're going against the grain. So if you're going to stand up for yourself there's only one way to do it, which is you do it. And so building the audience and the channels and you have to prime the market. By which I mean if you're a public company, you're priming the market by getting them used to how you convey information to them.

(00:52:58):
If you're a small startup or a founder, you're priming the market by making your audience aware of how you normally communicate, so that when you do something it's not weird. If you never post and then suddenly you start posting, people are going to think you're having a crisis or something like what is going on? They're going to try to read into it. So you have to already have the cadence and the relationships set up so that when you need to draw on them if you're under attack then you can, that's the defense of it. The offense of it is if you're doing something new and if you're mission driven, and if what you're doing is truly unique and innovative, no one else will be to tell that as well as you. The most friendly, sympathetic reporter on Earth could not tell that as well as you because they don't understand it as well as you, and so the onus just falls on you to do it.

Lenny (00:53:52):
If someone listening is like, "Yep, okay, I fully agree, time to do this." What do you suggest as a next step to starting to build an audience and going direct broadly.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:54:03):
Step one would be assessing what are you good at and what do you enjoy? So that's where you decide, do I like long form writing, or do I enjoy podcasting, or what are my mediums? Step two is setting up your account on those channels. So if you enjoy long form writing then you're going to have to choose, do you do a Substack, do you do Medium or whatever else? There's a objectively right answer on that one. But if you are doing short videos you're going to choose are you going to invest in Instagram, or you're going to invest in TikTok, you set that up. And then you start building your audience. And when you start if you're actually starting from zero, get some pipeline of talent ready. Sorry, not pipeline or talent, pipeline of content. Get it ready, it's the same way as if you're launching a Substack.

(00:54:54):
If you're launching a Substack you want to get a week or two of posts ready to go, so that out the gate you can build a lot of momentum. With different social networks it actually helps the algorithm if you come out the gate strong and are really regular. So TikTok, for example, if you're starting at TikTok with zero followers, you want to get a week or two of solid data just in the pipeline so you can hit it, hit it because the algorithm favors you right as you're starting out because they want you to keep going, so you want to ride that as much as possible. So that's step two is just get yourself ready for launch. Don't do one post and wait, get a bunch of posts ready and then boom, boom, boom. And then three is to have an ongoing content strategy, you know who you're going to reach, you know what they care about.

(00:55:42):
So you have to plan out, "Here's the cadence with which I'm going to talk to them. Here's how I'm going to do community management and respond to people, and here are the ways where I'm going to do announcements." And you get into a cadence because it's the same as growing a newsletter. The regularity and the consistency is a big part of growing. And so it's the same with audience. A mistake that people make I think is just every once in a while trying to go viral as opposed to just being consistent. And then some posts do better than others organically, but that's the way to do it. I don't live that. I'm not a good example because I'm so self-loathing about being on Twitter I will go away for one or two weeks and do nothing, and then I'll come in with a bunch of posts in one day. It's not a best practice. It's not the way you're supposed to do it. Ideally, you're just there every day saying something and then it builds over time.

Lenny (00:56:36):
I'm actually an example of trying to focus on consistent non-viral content and it's worked out.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:56:44):
It has worked out.

Lenny (00:56:46):
It's worked out. It's worked out so far, but it's interesting to see how different people act and how it's like I'm trying to go viral every tweet, every post and that is hard. And it's also just like people can tell you're just trying to create some viral thing and no one cares.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:57:00):
And it's very obvious when you're just trying to go viral for the sake of it and you don't have a real message. It's like the post when people screenshot the iPhone six digit security code and they say best feature apple's ever built. A few people did that, and now I've seen it probably dozens of times. And it doesn't even help to get you followers because that's not something where people say, "Only this person could uniquely give me this kind of content in the future." If you're going to get followers with a one-off joke, it has to be an incredibly hilarious one-off joke where they say, "This person is going to keep entertaining me." But with these kind of viral baits, I don't think it's even that effective.

Lenny (00:57:41):
And also what I find if something does go viral, whatever the correct term is and then life goes on, nothing's going to significantly... that's just one thing, and then you have to do it again and again. That's where people don't realize like, "Oh, I went viral. I'm done. My life is good now." Nothing's going to really change most often, and you have to do it again and again.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:58:03):
I think that's true. One thing that I've noticed about your audience, Lenny, is that it's the right audience. It's the people who find value in what you do, and they're in the right place and there's a match. Sometimes in the effort to just gain followers for the sake of it or a go viral for the sake of it, you end up with a mismatch of the audience. You had this viral hamster tweet, and now they're all here expecting hamster content, and they're not engaging with you, you're not bringing value to them. It's just making the number go up, which is not that meaningful. So one example of this is there's all these threads about how to just grow on Twitter for no reason, just grow for the sake of growing.

(00:58:48):
And it's a lot of generic advice of make sure that you bullet point out the 10 things. But it's always pablum of make sure that you value your relationships, and make time for yourself. And things that are not enriching people's lives they get a lot of likes that are low value likes from random people about the internet. But I don't think that they're deepening a relationship with a meaningful audience, and I don't think that they're really capturing the respect and admiration of their peers. So I think it's just important to consider what trade-offs people make in their efforts to grow.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:35):
Ready.

Lenny (00:59:35):
First question. Great. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:41):
I recommend Gates of Fire, it comes off the Marine Commandants Reading List, it's on there perennially. It is about the Battle of Thermopylae, it's the 300 Spartans, but it's the whole backstory. And if you get into it's about leadership, it's about courage, it's about creativity, and it's really well-written, so that's one that I recommend a lot.

Lenny (01:00:00):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:03):
I've been watching The Last Of Us, like everybody on Earth. I've been watching it both for entertainment and for work, because it's really interesting to see how the show drives sales of the video games, and how you can use that to make the whole of the sales greater than the sum of its parts. So I'm watching that really carefully.

Lenny (01:00:24):
Interesting. We have a drinking game now. Every time someone says Last of us that's a new thing because it's starting to come up a lot, so everyone enjoy your drink. Favorite interview question you like to ask?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:36):
I like to ask people what they've been reading too. It's a good way to get good book recommendations. It's also a good way to see where their head's at when they're not working.

Lenny (01:00:45):
Favorite SaaS products that you use day-to-day and bonus points for something that is new or interesting that you've recently discovered?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:52):
I don't know that this is new or novel because I use Notion for almost everything, and I really like the new AI that they've built into it. I also have been using Lex, which is Nathan Baschez startup, where it's like the AI writing editor that you've probably seen. I'm trying to think if there's anything that I use that other people don't. I don't think I'm terribly original in that sense. I use a lot of Microsoft Excel, which I think is controversial.

Lenny (01:01:21):
That is, wow, that's cool, but I get it. That's when you know you're doing serious work, you got to accelerate.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:27):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:01:28):
Final question, best tip for someone trying to get attention for their product, take away tip, best takeaway tip.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:37):
Give it away for free to the right people. If you can choose the people who are going to love it, look at the Venn diagram of people who are going to be obsessed with this product. And people who have a large following among the other people that you want to get to, whoever falls into that sliver of the Venn diagram shower them with free product.

Lenny (01:01:58):
Amazing. Lulu, I think this conversation is going to lead to a lot more people going direct, taking risks and ideas spreading. Thank you for being here. Two final questions where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:13):
People can find me at getflack.com, that's where I write down my ideas, hopefully more frequently in the future than in the past. But that's where they can find some of this stuff if they're interested. How can listeners be helpful to me is to give me feedback. I'm learning on the job. I don't think that there's anyone alive who's an expert in communicating in this crazy environment that we have now. I think we're all crossing the river by feeling the stones, and so your listeners have gone through this in many different ways. And I hope that if they have new ideas of feedback or objections, that they'll email me through that website or on Twitter and let me know what they think.

Lenny (01:02:54):
Amazing and its get flack.com.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):
Yes.

Lenny (01:02:55):
We'll link to it in the show notes.

# Pricing your AI product: Lessons from 400+ companies and 50 unicorns | Madhavan Ramanujam

## Transcript

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:00):
The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):
It feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:11):
The winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
What would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:33):
If you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a two-by-two. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the outcome-based pricing model, the top-right quadrant where you have great autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:58):
Some of them, yes, without naming names.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Madhavan Ramanujam. Madhavan is the smartest person I know on pricing and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon-Kucher, he's worked with over 250 companies, including 30 unicorns, to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products.

(00:01:18):
He's also the author of the book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel, called Scaling Innovation, which teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth and also how to avoid the common traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses.

Madhavan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:37):
It's exciting to be back, Lenny. Thanks so much for hosting me again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
This is a very rare second visit to the podcast. You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:54):
Yes, I think I ran out of printer ink after that, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
I appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through some of the biggest lessons that you shared in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since writing the first book.

(00:05:11):
Let me start with this question. Why'd you decide to write another book? And what is the difference between Scaling Innovation, which is the name of this book, and Monetizing Innovation, is the name of the first book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:05:21):
So Monetizing Innovation, we actually wrote it eight years ago. Time Flies. And the core thesis of that book was, how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need, value, and are actually willing to pay for? And I think that took a life of its own.

(00:05:36):
And over the years, we kept getting another question from entrepreneurs that, "Hey, we built a great product, we know there is willingness to pay, but how do we build a great business? How do we scale this?" And the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product, you might actually not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably. So we wrote Scaling Innovation in an effort to actually solve that puzzle.

(00:05:55):
So you can think of this as a sequel to Monetizing Innovation. And Monetizing Innovation. Talked about how to build great products. Scaling Innovation talks about how to build a great business. And writing a book is... There needs to be a purpose for this. For me, the reason for writing books is about giving a bit back based on what I know to founders. And book writing is hard. Writing a good book is even harder.

(00:06:19):
And just like Monetizing Innovation, Scaling Innovation is not marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start implementing. And we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
I love people like you that do the work for, I don't know, decades at this point, learn from real life experiences over and over and over, and then just share all this stuff with people. This is the most... the highest ROI way to learn, is letting you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's why I love these books.

(00:07:00):
If you had to boil down the thesis of this book into just a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's heads, what would that be?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:07:08):
So if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is you need to be able to master two engines: market share and wallet share.

(00:07:26):
It sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex. Because if you unpack that, for gaining market share and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention, as in get customers, make an initial money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers.

(00:07:46):
Many companies, actually, what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying, "I'll grow at all costs and postpone monetization." You see some who would say, "I'm going to monetize earlier on," but they might miss out on acquisition opportunities. Or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring.

(00:08:17):
So the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all given points in time, but it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about the trade-offs and saying, "How can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting towards profitable growth?" That's the core thesis of the book.

(00:08:47):
We actually showcase nine strategies that actually allow companies to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular strategy circumvents a single-engine problem and helps you focus on market share and wallet share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean, think about this ways. If you're flying a aircraft, you don't want to flight on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Okay. So I imagine many founders or people thinking about starting a company are not feeling like they're in one bucket or another. Intuitively, you're not like, "Oh, Of course. We're going to just focus on growth forever, and that's all that matters."

(00:09:36):
You had these kind of traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just the common traps you find founders fall into that people may recognize like, "Shit, that's what I'm doing probably"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:09:47):
So let's unpack the traps that are correlated to the archetypes. If you're a disruptor archetype, you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land, but you might not expand. As in your eagerness for acquiring, you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away, but you don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into.

(00:10:12):
The second trap that you actually fall into is you start... A market share that won, is different from a market share that is actually held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, keep them happy, et cetera. So you might fall into that trap.

(00:10:34):
If you're a moneymaker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might nickel and dime your customers to death. Because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a very differentiated pricing model, different levels, hidden fees, things to charge for many different things and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer.

(00:10:53):
The second trap that a moneymaker actually falls into is that you fall into the price premium paradox where you think that pricing high actually indicates value, but your price is so high that you actually start hurting your acquisition, so it just becomes irrelevant for most people.

(00:11:13):
If you're in the community builder, you actually fall into two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the foundation that you actually miss the frontier, which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget to attract different types of customers and you're not acquiring.

(00:11:30):
And the second trap that you fall into if you're a community builder is you train your customers to expect more for less. Because you're so eager to satisfy your loyal base, you start giving them more and more, and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.

(00:11:46):
So these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that you're avoiding these traps. In other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a moneymaker, and a community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to actually go about your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
Okay. So this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization, and innovation. Can you share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:12:21):
Sure. So I will unpack a couple of strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your early days it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and it's not creating too much friction in the sales conversation. I mean, the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you, right? If they were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain, you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple as that.

(00:13:02):
And having a simple pricing strategy also means that your pricing needs to be able to tell a value story, as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table.

(00:13:15):
A great example here is Superhuman. When they started, they were actually competing with free email products and they were coming up with a premium email experience. And how do you actually price that? And I thought the team at Superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job. They came up with a $30 price point per month, which was pretty simple. But the way they kind of told the story was that you pay a dollar a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week, and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right?

(00:13:50):
And pricing contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example, like the Subway $5 footlong is a different way to say a story with pricing that, oh, for $5, you get a lot of value actually back. So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story and how do you actually get that. So in the book, we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your pricing is beautifully simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):
As we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things, like you should do as many of these strategies as you can, or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:14:34):
So there are nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase, like just when you get started, and strategies that apply to you in your scale-up phase. So there are four strategies that you need to do in your startup and five in the scale-up, so it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the startup and all five actually apply in the scale-up phase, but it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things from day one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
So this first one was the startup phase?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:15:01):
Yeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the scale-up phase, I think one of the most important strategies is to master negotiations and really get better at acing negotiations, especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of conversations.

(00:15:25):
So to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. Mastering gives and gets, being good at value selling, and third, having the right negotiation strategies. So let's unpack that each at a time.

(00:15:39):
So giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, typically you're giving. I mean, you're giving concessions. People are asking. If you don't get anything back, you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you need to keep giving. But if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something to you to give, so you're asking something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective.

(00:16:10):
And in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this means is if you're giving a concession, ask for a value audit in exchange where every six months a team internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced. And this is great because if they actually engage in that, that gives you tremendous pricing power for renegotiations because it is their business case, they're championed it internally, and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a pretty harmless get, but it could be very powerful for future negotiations. So being good at-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:00):
That's really smart.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:17:01):
... gives and gets is... Thank you. Being good at gives and gets is really critical.

(00:17:07):
The second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value selling, you need to do three things. First, you need to be able to create the needs. Second, you need to be able to create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So creating needs is very important because many founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them.

(00:17:38):
So for instance, if you're a marketing automation AI product and you save, let's say, three weeks of work that actually needs to be done to actually get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers, the way you create the need is ask about existing processes and say, "Okay, so just so I understand, all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your marketing managers to take action. What if that was available to you instantaneously?" Oh, you have now just created a need, right? So being in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them.

(00:18:17):
The second thing is creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations. They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pause and create affirmation loops, things like, for instance, "Okay, so far, you've seen all of this. How does this actually play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard do you actually like?"

(00:18:44):
So when you ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product, you're creating affirmation loops, which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally. Because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced, then you also have a better commercial discussion.

(00:19:03):
And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And I see a lot of founders work on a POC. And after the POC's over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions.

(00:19:22):
The right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like, "Hey, how long does this process take today? How many engineers are there?" So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model. And if you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model. So a POC needs to be framed as the purpose of a POC is to build a business case, and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being a tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model.

(00:20:06):
And when you're building an ROI model, there are many buckets to focus on, but there are three that are very critical. The first one is, what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that your customer is tracking? So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the immediate, tangible, clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table.

(00:20:33):
The second bucket is cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? What are the tangible cost savings?

(00:20:41):
And the third one, which is often overlooked, is opportunity cost. For instance, if you save 10 hours of time for a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can actually use in your value selling to defend the right price.

(00:21:02):
So we talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies would you actually use. And there are a couple of strategies that we have found to be really productive.

(00:21:20):
The first one is to show up with options. Many founders rush with one product and one price and say, "Okay, this is a hundred K product, and that's what we are trying to sell." Inevitably, what will happen is the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price, and you're only talking about price.

(00:21:39):
But if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a good, better, best, if you're a hundred K product, a 200K and a 300K option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value. Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'll say, "Hey, I like the hundred K price point, but I actually like the functionality in your 200K product." Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like? Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to value as opposed to just talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price.

(00:22:18):
And showcasing options doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. I was talking to this founder who said, "Hey, I think the budget is about 100K. That's what I believe from the key stakeholder, but my product really brings crazy value. I could even charge, let's say, a 500K for this product, but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500K price because I kind of know a hundred K is the budget. What should I do?" So for those kind of situations, actually show up with options in your pricing model.

(00:22:58):
So we coached him to go in with a hundred K, plus 10% on any incremental value that you bring, or it's a 500K fixed. So now this is actually a great situation in negotiation. Because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the hundred K. It's a small fee to actually get started. But the conversation will gravitate towards, "What is that 10%? How do you measure value?" That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about, "How you add value? Where's the value generation? What portion would you take?"

(00:23:28):
And you see one of two situations. Either the customer say, "That's great. You're putting skin in the game. Let's go with a hundred K and 10%," or, 80% of the situations, you might actually want to avoid the outcome-based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500K at that point. It is the premium that you're actually paying for the certainty. So no one is focusing on the 5K because of the hundred K option on the table, and you just put a 500K and got the courage to do that. And in this specific situation, that 500K got negotiated to 400K, and they just 4X the deal compared to where they would be. So having options on the table when you negotiate is critical.

(00:24:05):
And there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book, like anchoring is important. If you start high, you'll also end up higher. And also tapering concessions. How do you give concessions? I mean, the worst negotiators will start by giving a small concession and then give a bit more when someone asks like... You might give a 5% discount, and the procurement guy says, "That's not enough." "Okay, I'll give you 10% more." "Okay, that's not enough." "I'll give you 15." What are you indicating to the other person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts.

(00:24:35):
The best negotiators who taper the concessions. So they would say, "I can give you 15%." "Okay, I need more." "I'll give you five." "I need more." "I'll give you two." So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation's actually ending. So how do you taper concessions also become important.

(00:24:51):
So when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and gets, you get better at value selling, and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're at the scale-up phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):
This is such great advice. I love that this is just one small chapter of your book. This could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have a whole thing on negotiation in a book about scaling innovation and growing your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making? Is that why you put so much effort into this part?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:25:31):
Exactly. I mean, in a B2B situation, you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models. But at least even today, it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value, how do you contextualize your price, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.

(00:25:49):
So to us, negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just negotiation tactics, like keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. This is actual negotiation strategies that are rooted on value selling, gives and gets, and focusing on extracting full value from every deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:14):
So useful. This idea of throwing out a third higher priced option, say 500K, it's so interesting. Because usually the advice I hear is like, "Just throw out twice the number you used to... " Just put it out there just in case, which is really scary to ask for like, "What about $50,000?" And this is like a much less scary way of doing that. "Okay, but we also have this 500K option. Here's what you get." And then they may be like, "Oh, that's exactly what we want." And you're like, "Oh, wow. It worked."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:40):
Exactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
That is so cool.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:44):
Put a good price point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:45):
Wow, this is awesome. This is just like a golden nugget within golden nuggets of advice. Okay. So you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:59):
Sure. We talk about how to land and expand, as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you are landing, but also expanding. We talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy, how to stop churn before it happens, how to do price increases effectively. Because at some point in your scale-up journey, you need to increase price, but how do you do that meaningful fashion?

(00:27:24):
So we have various strategies that apply both for the startup and the scale-up phase. But in combination, all of those things help you articulate and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
Awesome. Okay. Let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very different from other previous traditional pricing strategies. And it feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days, so I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:27:51):
Yeah, AI pricing is very different from the previous vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days, like day one in their seed stage pre-seed kind of thing, which was not probably the focus for the previous SaaS companies. Why is that? So because of two reasons.

(00:28:11):
One, for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from day one. But there's also a more critical reason, which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your customers to expect more for less.

(00:28:31):
So for instance, think about this. If you're building a agentic AI product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10X compared to software budgets. So if you use all the old playbooks, then you're under monetizing, again, from day one and training your customers to expect more for less. So how do you come up with foundational models that actually allow you to capture the value that you bring to the table?

(00:28:55):
And why has this become critical? Because with AI, finally, founders can really solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages... For instance, if you take Slack, you can say that the productivity went up, efficiency happened, but you cannot measure it, monitor it, attribute it to Slack. Okay, that's probably why they were in a seed-based pricing model.

(00:29:17):
But in today's situations, you see companies that say, "In a Fortune 100 company, I was able to improve throughput by 10%, reduce crap by 5%." And when you get into those kinds of situation where an AI is creating core value and it's attributable to the AI, you get a lot of pricing power.

(00:29:35):
So the two questions that we commonly hear from AI founders is, "How do I set the right pricing model?" as in, "How do I charge?" which becomes way more important than how much you charge. Because the underlining business model has changed. We have moved from software being a pay for access to now you're paying for work delivered. So the monetization model's become key. That is the first question that people actually ask us.

(00:30:05):
The second one is, "How do I navigate POCs, commercial discussions early?" Because the buyer on the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion." So those two topics become very critical, and we have showcased a lot of this in the book.

(00:31:34):
Let's talk about this POC piece because I think this is something a lot of people deal with. And then I want to talk about this two-by-two that you have in the book. And I'll actually pull it up. So let's talk about POCs first.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:31:43):
So POCs, when we talk about POCs, many founders think about a POC as a proof of technical functionality, and is their product actually working in their customer environments. And they set up the expectation that we are saying, "Hey, we are going to put the product, and we're going to see if it actually works." And they would probably say, "Should I charge for a POC versus not?" And we'll unpack that in a bit, should you or should you not.

(00:32:10):
And that's actually a completely wrong way of framing it. The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case.

(00:32:30):
So if you frame it this way is you can say, "Look, it is a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI model and building a business case along with their users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we can get to commercial discussions." So that way you've actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on co-creating a business case with the customer. And based on the business case, you can actually come up with a proper commercial agreement. And if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. So thinking about the POCs in that kind of manner.

(00:33:03):
And the question that I often get asked is, "Should I charge for a POC?" And the answer is yes, but smartly. Let's talk about why it's important to charge. The reason you need to charge for a POC is you start isolating people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who are just curious about AI. They just want to see if it works or not. They will say, "Yes, I'll engage with the POC." They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a lot of resources, never buy. You've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So having a price tag to your POC actually indicates that there is seriousness on both sides, so you should charge.

(00:33:48):
But how do you actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. What this means is that you need to make sure that your POC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because let's say if you just say it's a 10K POC for a 30-day pilot. If you don't talk about the fact that it is not the same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that, okay, it's 120K per year kind of deal if the POC works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion.

(00:34:28):
But your buyer on the other side might still push you saying, "That's all great, but I need a price or a budget, otherwise I won't move forward with it." So there are two ways to actually deflect those kind of questions. The first way is contextualize the price on the value. So you can say something like, if you're pushed for price, "Hey, for customers such as yours, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations. And our pricing is... One is to 10X when it comes to ROI."

(00:34:58):
So you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you actually didn't say it. You just said, "It's a 10 million, and I'm taking one in 10 in exchange for it." So you've given the buyer an indication, but you've framed it in such a manner that actually is justifiable, right? A one in 10X ROI. So that's one way to do it.

(00:35:16):
They might still say, "Yeah, that's good, but I need a budget." So then rather than just give them a budget saying, "It could be a 200K option," don't do that. That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like, "Look, the final pricing would be anywhere from 500K to a million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you, we can pick a point in that range that justifies the value that we bring to the table." So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way to actually go about POCs.

(00:35:46):
So how you navigate your early wins, who you choose is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the destiny for the rest of your future. And picking those early wins is very, very critical. And having buyers who are serious, lead qualifying, having the right POC process, and thinking about POCs as, frankly, not just trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value, but it's a great chance to have a commercial test-and-learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can bring to the table in terms of your value and what portion can you actually take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:26):
So the core takeaway here is, for AI companies, you no longer can just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is what you start with is what you're going to end up with, and it's very easy to under monetize because people aren't realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force savings versus just SaaS software that's making people a little bit more efficient.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:36:50):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization, and they need to master it from day one. And when we talk to early-stage founders, it is a topic that keeps many people up at night, but that's also why we wrote Scaling Innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about pricing correctly from day one. And it's become very critical for AI companies to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:16):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, I won't name names, do you think they've under monetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:37:24):
Some of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of, let's say, fast revenue growth, but is that enduring revenue? Are people actually going to stay? And is there going to be churn? And so there are a lot of aspects to marketing profitable growth. It's not just growing fast, but also growing profitably and having an enduring business. So some of them, yes, without naming names. But yeah, I think that's why it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:54):
Well, those are different. I think what you're saying here is the retention may not work for some of these companies. But on the other hand, they're really cheap. 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be 10 times more productive potentially, is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:38:11):
Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, I think there are companies that have actually done that. And they try to undo it with having more sophisticated, let's say, products that are actually higher priced or much higher priced, et cetera. That's one way to undo that situation.

(00:38:32):
So it's really a trade-off between getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book, market share and wallet share, and how do you dominate both. So if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just accelerate your market share, you're in trouble.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
Okay. This is a great segue to this two-by-two, which goes much deeper into this. So it's easy to be like, "Here's what you shouldn't do." Here's your advice on what to actually do. So I'm going to pull up on my screen this two-by-two that you have in your book. So if you're watching YouTube, you'll be able to see it.

(00:39:13):
So talk about this. This is essentially how to figure out the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:39:20):
So when you talk about AI companies and monetization models, we get asked this question. "Should I be usage-based? Should I be outcome? Should I be a copilot mode? Or how do I actually think about my pricing model?" So we came up with this framework, which is a relatively simple, straightforward framework, but very powerful.

(00:39:39):
So there are two axes here. One is attribution, and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power, and we'll come back to that in a bit, right?

(00:39:51):
So let's take the first bottom-left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a seed-based or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not being able to attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a copilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode, so a seed-based pricing would actually make sense.

(00:40:18):
But if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think about is, how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing power? So if you think about the bottom-right quadrant, those are companies that have actually done that. They can prove more attribution to what they actually bring to the table, but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode, as in there is still humans in the loop.

(00:40:43):
If you take Cursor, for instance, it definitely improves productivity, can actually bring down the time to actually do code, the attribution is clear, but it's still in a copilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid pricing model is the best option where you still have a seed-based model for the copilot kind of use case, but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are a certain number of AI credits or tokens that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more, then you're actually paying more on consumption. So it's a hybrid model that actually works there.

(00:41:18):
If you look at the top-left quadrant, those are products that are very autonomous but are not strong on attribution. So these tend to be mostly backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to run businesses, can be autonomous, but they're not directly impacting the KPIs that businesses are tracking, and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So in that situation, you need to be on a pay-for-what-you-consume and a usage-based model. A seed-based model would not make sense because it's autonomous. There's no human in the loop. But that's why you're also in a usage-based model, saying the more you use it, the more you're actually charged. And usage becomes a proxy for the value that you bring to the table.

(00:42:07):
The quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden quadrant, which is the top-right one. That's the outcome-based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered, but you're charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome-based model situation.

(00:42:35):
So a classic example here is Intercom for Fin. What they actually do is they charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to resolve the ticket completely independently without a human in the loop, then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed, they don't charge for it. So they're more on an outcome-based model. Or companies like Charge Flow would charge up to 25% on a charge bag that they're able to actually recover, because these are core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable, highly autonomous so you can start moving towards an outcome-based pricing model.

(00:43:14):
If you look at the state of where AI is today, as of the day of recording this podcast, now, the most popular model is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected, because the previous SaaS playbook was usually on the seat-based model, but they've all now moved on to at least a hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage, et cetera, about 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model as of today. But those companies, some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they actually bring to the table.

(00:43:54):
In the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.

(00:44:22):
In a lot of benchmarks and studies that actually show, and this is also my belief, that in the next three years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant because that's a magic quadrant. If you can truly price based on outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):
Wow. Okay. I'm just going to pause again. This is amazing. Madhavan, thank you so much for it. I love, again, that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff, come here, tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible.

(00:45:01):
Let me ask you this. By the way, for folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome-based pricing, Sierra, Fin, and Chargeflow. We've got the founder of Sierra and Fin coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all this with those guys.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:16):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
So is the way to use this two-by-two figuring out your model? Is it like, "Okay, I'm like Cursor. I'm going to go in this quadrant," or is it, "How do I get to outcome-based no matter what? That's where I need to be"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:32):
Yeah, so that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out what is your right archetype based on where you are today. I think that is most important. If you try to rush into an outcome-based pricing model but cannot prove attribution, you will fail. So it is really coming up with what is the right archetype based on what I'm doing today, but also use this two-by-two to say, "How do I paint a vision to actually get to outcome based? And can I get close to that? Or can I be purely an outcome-based model? How do I evolve into that?"

(00:46:05):
What that would mean is, how do I build functionality in the products to actually show attribution, how do I build more agentic workforces to take the human out of the loop and be more autonomous, and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient yourself towards more outcome-based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution, that means, first of all, understanding what are the KPIs of your customers. How do they track their business performance? Can you impact it? Can you productize things in your product that showcase that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner? Can you build dashboards to show value attribution? Can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to you? So how do you create these kind of attribution mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on building more agentic workforces that can actually be on an autonomous mold?

(00:47:04):
So pick the right archetype and plan to get to as close as you can to the outcome-based pricing model. That's how I would use the two-by-two. And you actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category... Like back in the day with GitHub, everyone, they started with a seed-based model. They've now moved to the hybrid-based pricing model with Cursors and everyone else, but the natural move would be more towards a outcome-based pricing model where a AI agent can probably code everything at the same time, debug it, and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person. And that actually becomes more closer to a outcome-based model because it's attributable and autonomous. So that is picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is the key way to interpret this two-by-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
This explains why everyone's pulling agents. That's where the money's at, what you're telling us here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:00):
Yeah. It's going to be the age of The Matrix. Too many agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Agent Smiths everywhere. They didn't turn out too great. So what I'm hearing is if I were Canva... So Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What you would do if you were helping Canva is what can you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:31):
Exactly. And a good case for that is the Fin product from Intercom. Because traditionally, all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. How many customer service agents are actually using the product? It used to be seed based, but they built out Fin, which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets. And then that actually enables them to move to the outcome-based pricing model quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
Amazing. So say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these POCs where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcome-based pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize it? What would you add to that?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:17):
Yes. I mean, at least be able to contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcome-based pricing model, be clear on the outcome that you're actually creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if your customers agree with the business case, then you can actually take a portion of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:43):
Fin, actually, they're a new sponsor of the podcast, and I learned... I didn't know this. It costs 99 cents for every support ticket they solve [inaudible 00:49:51].

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:51):
Through AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Through AI.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:53):
Exactly. If it needs a human intervention, then they don't charge for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):
Yeah. And it's just like, what? That's such a simple story. Your agent costs 20 bucks. This thing costs 99 cents

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:03):
Yeah. That is two chapters in one beautifully simple pricing and an outcome-based pricing model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:09):
And interestingly, they were the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter ones, like, "What products do you pay the most for?" and it was always Intercom. And everyone hated their pricing, and they found a solution.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:21):
I think they found a great solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):
Okay. So is there anything else along these lines that you think companies, especially AI companies, should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you'd want to share before we move on to other stuff?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:34):
I think we've covered most of the topics. Like we said, it's being thoughtful about POCs, choosing the right pricing archetype or the pricing models. Those things become very critical in the early stages. But when you start scaling and, let's say, you become a multi-product company, then you need to start focusing on, "What kind of packaging strategy should I have? Is it a platform plus add-ons? Should I have versions of the products like good, better, best? Should I tackle different use cases because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a healthcare use case? Should I productize to different use cases? Is that my packaging strategy? Or should I keep it completely modularized for people to pick and choose?"

(00:51:17):
So these kind of questions become more critical, and that's why the chapter on blowing up your packaging from your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scale-up phase become very critical. So I think that's the next thing that founders would be hit with, as in when they build multiple products, they need to think about the whole packaging, cross-selling, up-selling motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
This touches on something I was about to ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. How often is it a success to change the way you price? I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often... What does it take to successfully shift the way you price down the road if people are listening to this and are like, "Shit, we already have this pricing strategy"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:52:00):
Back in the day, we used to say that you should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, how much you're charging at least once in two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half because of the scale with which and the speed with which companies are built and competing.

(00:52:16):
So I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve it in day one, fill it, and forget it. You have to be thoughtful from day one, but also be ready to pivot, iterate, and you're going to learn along your journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test-and-learn opportunity in your early days.

(00:52:38):
And there are things that you would change more often, and there are things that you probably don't want to change too often. Things like pricing model, unless you really changed your attribution autonomy, there is no need to shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse things.

(00:52:54):
But there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been six months a year? Yeah, you should. Because in a year there's probably prices go up three to 5% for everything that you consume. But how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price increases smartly become very important in the scale-up phase.

(00:53:16):
I think Warren Buffett summarized this really well. He said the true definition of a company is a pricing power. And if you have a prayer session for doing a 10% price increase, you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn, but you're also able to pass on the increase as a value exchange, those things become critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
Awesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three referred axioms from the book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:53:55):
You talked about Sierra being in your park founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but here's a shout-out for Clay. So Clay actually read the entire book and gave me feedback, Scaling Innovation, the similar copy that he actually had. I called it Scaling Innovation Axioms throughout the book. And the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day, if you can just take all the axioms, put it in a printout next to your desk is the summary of the book. And it's like PT statements that you'll just remember what to do.

(00:54:26):
So he came up with this idea that, "Hey, rather than calling them just generic scaling innovation axioms, you need to brand each and every axiom." And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So I went about coming up with a unique... He even contributed to some of the names. We came up with some unique names for each axiom.

(00:54:45):
And here's the other fun fact. Probably I'm geeking out too much. But when I counted the number of axioms, there were 42 axioms. And I didn't try to make this up. And if you're a Hitchhiker's fan, then you know that's the answer to everything.

(00:54:58):
But jokes apart, let me unpack a few axioms. One of my first favorite axioms, what I call is the 20-80 axiom. Especially in tech companies, 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that the 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they take this 20%, build it, put it out in the market almost for free, and then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not been thoughtful about that, you've given the farm away unintentionally.

(00:55:37):
So truly understanding what drives willingness to pay in your product is critical. And I think people call it the MVP. I think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product, it should be the most valuable product. And be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early products I think is key. That's the 20-80 axiom.

(00:55:58):
Probably my second one is the price paralysis axioms. So what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's not external and logical. This goes back to the same prayer session to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business. So it's mostly internal and emotional, and how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.

(00:56:29):
Probably my third favorite one is stopping churn before it happens, so stopping churn axiom. So to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? Most companies will try to stop churn when someone actually says, "I want to go." It is too late, and you're being reactive. At the most, you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another six months, and they will leave. They've already made that determination.

(00:56:59):
The way to stop churn is to start acquiring customers who won't leave. And that is the most important thing. So if you look back at your data and say, "Who are the types of customers who actually tend to stay longer? What are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of those?" then you stop churn before it happens. And that's the key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
That's interesting. I'm surprised you didn't say what was my favorite, which is... I think it's like, "If you land, make sure to expand."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That one really stuck with me.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:29):
That's a good one, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
Maybe talk about that one. Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:32):
Sure. I mean, so if you land, you need to also make sure you're expanding, in the sense that if you give the farm away in your entry-level product, you don't have much to actually monetize later. So being thoughtful about what is the fence between your land product. Is it a free experience? What is the getting? And the getting is typically based on are you getting based on features? Are you also getting on usage? And how do you be thoughtful about that? So you leave stuff for the expansion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
Okay. So zooming out even further, to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away that they think they understand but they probably don't?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:58:14):
Yeah, I think this comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share and wallet share if they're growing. And even if you ask them, they'll say like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about wallet share," but have they really thought about it equally and paid equal attention? Have they postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single-engine strategy consciously or subconsciously? I think that's the key takeaway I have.

(00:58:40):
So the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company, you might need to be more market share dominating. In certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort, but it's equal attention and really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect. And that is the main takeaway that I have for people. And if you are not in that mindset already, there's a book for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
I'll point them to it. So just so folks know what to do when they're like, "Okay, I need to focus on wallet share more," is the main focus figure out a pricing model that aligns well with pricing power, what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in wallet-share thinking?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:59:28):
So it's actually all of those. Market share, wallet share, acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do. If you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share... Let's say, for instance, you need to have the right land-and-expand strategy. The land helps you with acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share.

(00:59:54):
If you have a pricing model, then you need to have a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive, but it should also help you recover value, which is like your monetization. And if people understand your pricing model, they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort of goes hand in hand. So I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful. Because if you follow those strategies, you are not going to fall into the single-engine strap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
All right. That is a very reasonable answer. Madhavan, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:00:41):
Read the two books in sequence, Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. Because it's one thing to build a great product, it's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a not-so-great product, and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's thinking about pricing early, especially for AI companies, being thoughtful about it, price before product, and then thinking about how to actually scale, developing a profitable growth mindset. All of these things become critical. And I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
I feel like your books are in the staple of founder reading. There's all these things you just don't know what you're doing. And there's a few of these books that are like, "Okay, here's all this advice that'll answer so many questions and save you so much heartache." And so I'm really excited you're adding something to that bookshelf. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:16):
Okay. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):
Let's go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:41):
The first one that comes to mind is Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It's a classic and one of my favorite books. I recommend a lot of people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also seeing from a more strategic business model angle.

(01:01:57):
I like this book, Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I think that's also a classic because, again, there's always a human element to things. And understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're in B2C or in B2B. Because if you're in a B2B situation, it's humans having a human conversation. So it's as much behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I love that book, and there's a lot of nuggets in there, so I recommend a lot.

(01:02:20):
And probably the third one that I recommend is a book called Contagious by Jonah Berger. I love that. He was in the PhD program at Stanford in marketing, and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral. And he's actually seen the best viral messages and boiled it down to a framework. And if you follow that, then you can make those messages viral. And I've tried to use some of those in my own outreaches and things of that nature, so I think it's a fantastic read.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
Wow.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:52):
Have you read it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Got to check this out. I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. We're going to go viral because we got the playbook.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:57):
Contagious. That's the name of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Contagious. Okay. We'll link to that. Is there a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:04):
I guess a movie. Sure, let's pick a movie. Definitely enjoyed Mission Impossible, the final one, eighth in the sequence. I think I find that a whole... I love those, the entire genre, one through eight. But what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would've probably gone and seen it, when I wanted to. So I thought that's an interesting example of a durable brand where your monetization power actually increase over a period of time. So I think I enjoyed the movie. It was great. Yeah.

(01:03:43):
Hey, by the way, I just realized MI stands for Monetizing Innovation and also Mission Impossible. Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:52):
And you're the Tom Cruise character.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:53):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):
I love how you're the only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through a monetization, willingness-to-pay lens.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:00):
Exactly. I think there's too many of these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and monetization. I think it's become my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh, man. We need a version of this movie, like a Mission Possible of Madhavan.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:14):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:14):
I'd pay anything for that. All right. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:22):
I would probably talk about two products. The first one is Delphi, the Digital Mind representation. There's a Lennybot that you actually, I think, put out. I find that product fascinating, and I also love the founders, Dara and Sam there. I truly believe that that is going to be the future for thought leadership and how thoughts are consumed by consumers.

(01:04:46):
And I've used your Lennybot. I really enjoy it, like if I can co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I really love the product category. There's a lot of different use cases, longevity, extension, use cases, things of that nature. I'm excited about the product. I think it's been great. I plan to, taking inspiration from you, plan to create a Delphi of myself-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay. I was going to ask.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:15):
... at some point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:16):
I think it should be [inaudible 01:05:17]-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):
So that one would... Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:18):
... the book maybe. I'll try to. That's the promise. Try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about the book or things of that nature and talk pricing, you can talk to my AI, too, right? I mean, I find the product fascinating.

(01:05:31):
The second one I would probably say that's been super useful in terms of just productivity is Granola. We love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and during all the meetings and organize it and being able to query things, et cetera. I think it's been a great product that we recently started trying and we've been really liking it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Cool. That's been the most mentioned product recently. How cool is that? Love Granola. Get a year free of Granola if you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com. Click bundle, one year free for not just you, your whole team. What an offer they offered. It's crazy.

(01:06:05):
On Delphi, what's interesting about LennyBot is it's not just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons also fed into it. What an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point, completely free. Lennybot.com. No, I get nothing from it. It's just out there.

(01:06:24):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:06:32):
Create value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow. That's my life motto.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
That resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is it used to be very expensive to work with at Simon-Kucher, I think it was called. Very expensive. A lot of big company stuff. Now a lot of more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups. So just talk about that. Talk about what you're doing these days.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:07:00):
Sure. I mean, at Simon-Kucher, I got to work with over 250 companies. And my co-GP now, Josh Bloom, he also had an opportunity to work with our 250 companies. So combined, we worked with our 500 companies, more than 50-plus unicorns. It was a great ride.

(01:07:16):
And often, we were actually working with them in much later stages when series D or pre-IPO, post-IPO, private equity companies, et cetera. But the two of us actually now started a venture firm with an explicit goal of working with early-stage AI founders. And it goes back to the topic that we started with. AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But for those kind of companies, fee-for-service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. And that's also why we pivoted to venture.

(01:07:51):
So our business model is pretty standard right now. You get access in the cap table. We roll up our sleeves and work with the founders in all things monetization. So we are invested in their success and we will partake in the value creation. There's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to concentrate our efforts in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies, and that's where we will be spending our time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
What a deal. Madhavan, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:08:25):
Ways to find out, I think just google for Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon, I think, if you want to purchase the books. Actually, Scaling Innovation is now available in pre-order. I think we'll have the pod released before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order.

(01:08:48):
And maybe I will take an inspiration from your master bundle, which I really think is the world's best bundle, and come up with my own bundle for getting users to pre-order. So if you love Monetizing Innovation, I can tell you you would really love Scaling Innovation. So go buy it for your teams. Buy it for yourself.

(01:09:06):
And here's the offer. So for anyone who's able to buy more than five copies, send us a screenshot of your purchase pre-order, right? Send us a screenshot of your purchase to promo@49palmsvc.com. So that's promo, as in promotion, @49 P-A-L-M-S-V-C .com.

(01:09:30):
And here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to bundles as a raffle, and the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, a 30-minute ask-me-anything session, an exclusive invite for a Scaling Innovation book launch, and also a Scaling Innovation t-shirt. So that's my coming up with a bundle. I didn't get Granola and others to put in for me just yet, but I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks to buy.

(01:10:01):
And, yeah. I mean if you like the book, please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful. Because if more people review it, the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community for Monetizing Innovation. I think there's been, over the last eight years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, posting on LinkedIn, and making things like price before product or product market price fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So I'm very passionate that people actually did that and very thankful for them. So there's also probably an equal measure. If you're excited about Scaling Innovation, I would love for you to talk about the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
Amazing. And I think the reason people do that is because you give away so much for free. You just shared so much wisdom for free that is going to help so many people, so it all comes back to you.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:05):
I just tried to plan my give and get right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
There we go. Oh my God. A good callback. Madhavan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:13):
Thank you so much, Lenny. Was a pleasure.

## Transcript

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:00):
The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):
It feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:11):
The winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
What would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:33):
If you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a two-by-two. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the outcome-based pricing model, the top-right quadrant where you have great autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:58):
Some of them, yes, without naming names.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Madhavan Ramanujam. Madhavan is the smartest person I know on pricing and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon-Kucher, he's worked with over 250 companies, including 30 unicorns, to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products.

(00:01:18):
He's also the author of the book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel, called Scaling Innovation, which teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth and also how to avoid the common traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses.

(00:01:36):
Bill Gurley wrote the foreword. I had a chance to read an early copy. I absolutely loved it. It's a book that every founder needs to read. And in this episode, Madhavan shares many of the biggest lessons from the book, including how pricing strategy is very different for AI companies, why you need to get your pricing model right from the start in today's market, a very simple two-by-two to help you pick your pricing model, how to gain pricing power, a ton of tactical advice for negotiating more effectively, the most common traps founders fall into, and so much more.

(00:02:05):
If you order five copies of the book, Madhavan is offering a chance to win a free conversation with him, a signed copy of the book, an invite to the book launch, a t-shirt, and more. Just send a copy of your purchase receipt to promo@49palmsvc.com.

(00:02:19):
And some more good news, Madhavan is now more accessible. He left Simon-Kucher. He's now investing full-time with his own fund. He focuses on early-stage AI companies. If you want to work with them, check him out at 49palmsvc.com.

(00:04:34):
Madhavan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:37):
It's exciting to be back, Lenny. Thanks so much for hosting me again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
This is a very rare second visit to the podcast. You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:54):
Yes, I think I ran out of printer ink after that, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
I appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through some of the biggest lessons that you shared in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since writing the first book.

(00:05:11):
Let me start with this question. Why'd you decide to write another book? And what is the difference between Scaling Innovation, which is the name of this book, and Monetizing Innovation, is the name of the first book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:05:21):
So Monetizing Innovation, we actually wrote it eight years ago. Time Flies. And the core thesis of that book was, how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need, value, and are actually willing to pay for? And I think that took a life of its own.

(00:05:36):
And over the years, we kept getting another question from entrepreneurs that, "Hey, we built a great product, we know there is willingness to pay, but how do we build a great business? How do we scale this?" And the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product, you might actually not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably. So we wrote Scaling Innovation in an effort to actually solve that puzzle.

(00:05:55):
So you can think of this as a sequel to Monetizing Innovation. And Monetizing Innovation. Talked about how to build great products. Scaling Innovation talks about how to build a great business. And writing a book is... There needs to be a purpose for this. For me, the reason for writing books is about giving a bit back based on what I know to founders. And book writing is hard. Writing a good book is even harder.

(00:06:19):
And just like Monetizing Innovation, Scaling Innovation is not marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start implementing. And we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
I love people like you that do the work for, I don't know, decades at this point, learn from real life experiences over and over and over, and then just share all this stuff with people. This is the most... the highest ROI way to learn, is letting you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's why I love these books.

(00:07:00):
If you had to boil down the thesis of this book into just a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's heads, what would that be?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:07:08):
So if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is you need to be able to master two engines: market share and wallet share.

(00:07:26):
It sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex. Because if you unpack that, for gaining market share and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention, as in get customers, make an initial money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers.

(00:07:46):
Many companies, actually, what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying, "I'll grow at all costs and postpone monetization." You see some who would say, "I'm going to monetize earlier on," but they might miss out on acquisition opportunities. Or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring.

(00:08:17):
So the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all given points in time, but it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about the trade-offs and saying, "How can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting towards profitable growth?" That's the core thesis of the book.

(00:08:47):
We actually showcase nine strategies that actually allow companies to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular strategy circumvents a single-engine problem and helps you focus on market share and wallet share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean, think about this ways. If you're flying a aircraft, you don't want to flight on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Okay. So I imagine many founders or people thinking about starting a company are not feeling like they're in one bucket or another. Intuitively, you're not like, "Oh, Of course. We're going to just focus on growth forever, and that's all that matters."

(00:09:36):
You had these kind of traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just the common traps you find founders fall into that people may recognize like, "Shit, that's what I'm doing probably"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:09:47):
So let's unpack the traps that are correlated to the archetypes. If you're a disruptor archetype, you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land, but you might not expand. As in your eagerness for acquiring, you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away, but you don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into.

(00:10:12):
The second trap that you actually fall into is you start... A market share that won, is different from a market share that is actually held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, keep them happy, et cetera. So you might fall into that trap.

(00:10:34):
If you're a moneymaker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might nickel and dime your customers to death. Because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a very differentiated pricing model, different levels, hidden fees, things to charge for many different things and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer.

(00:10:53):
The second trap that a moneymaker actually falls into is that you fall into the price premium paradox where you think that pricing high actually indicates value, but your price is so high that you actually start hurting your acquisition, so it just becomes irrelevant for most people.

(00:11:13):
If you're in the community builder, you actually fall into two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the foundation that you actually miss the frontier, which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget to attract different types of customers and you're not acquiring.

(00:11:30):
And the second trap that you fall into if you're a community builder is you train your customers to expect more for less. Because you're so eager to satisfy your loyal base, you start giving them more and more, and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.

(00:11:46):
So these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that you're avoiding these traps. In other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a moneymaker, and a community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to actually go about your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
Okay. So this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization, and innovation. Can you share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:12:21):
Sure. So I will unpack a couple of strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your early days it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and it's not creating too much friction in the sales conversation. I mean, the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you, right? If they were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain, you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple as that.

(00:13:02):
And having a simple pricing strategy also means that your pricing needs to be able to tell a value story, as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table.

(00:13:15):
A great example here is Superhuman. When they started, they were actually competing with free email products and they were coming up with a premium email experience. And how do you actually price that? And I thought the team at Superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job. They came up with a $30 price point per month, which was pretty simple. But the way they kind of told the story was that you pay a dollar a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week, and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right?

(00:13:50):
And pricing contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example, like the Subway $5 footlong is a different way to say a story with pricing that, oh, for $5, you get a lot of value actually back. So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story and how do you actually get that. So in the book, we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your pricing is beautifully simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):
As we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things, like you should do as many of these strategies as you can, or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:14:34):
So there are nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase, like just when you get started, and strategies that apply to you in your scale-up phase. So there are four strategies that you need to do in your startup and five in the scale-up, so it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the startup and all five actually apply in the scale-up phase, but it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things from day one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
So this first one was the startup phase?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:15:01):
Yeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the scale-up phase, I think one of the most important strategies is to master negotiations and really get better at acing negotiations, especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of conversations.

(00:15:25):
So to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. Mastering gives and gets, being good at value selling, and third, having the right negotiation strategies. So let's unpack that each at a time.

(00:15:39):
So giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, typically you're giving. I mean, you're giving concessions. People are asking. If you don't get anything back, you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you need to keep giving. But if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something to you to give, so you're asking something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective.

(00:16:10):
And in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this means is if you're giving a concession, ask for a value audit in exchange where every six months a team internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced. And this is great because if they actually engage in that, that gives you tremendous pricing power for renegotiations because it is their business case, they're championed it internally, and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a pretty harmless get, but it could be very powerful for future negotiations. So being good at-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:00):
That's really smart.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:17:01):
... gives and gets is... Thank you. Being good at gives and gets is really critical.

(00:17:07):
The second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value selling, you need to do three things. First, you need to be able to create the needs. Second, you need to be able to create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So creating needs is very important because many founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them.

(00:17:38):
So for instance, if you're a marketing automation AI product and you save, let's say, three weeks of work that actually needs to be done to actually get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers, the way you create the need is ask about existing processes and say, "Okay, so just so I understand, all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your marketing managers to take action. What if that was available to you instantaneously?" Oh, you have now just created a need, right? So being in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them.

(00:18:17):
The second thing is creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations. They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pause and create affirmation loops, things like, for instance, "Okay, so far, you've seen all of this. How does this actually play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard do you actually like?"

(00:18:44):
So when you ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product, you're creating affirmation loops, which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally. Because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced, then you also have a better commercial discussion.

(00:19:03):
And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And I see a lot of founders work on a POC. And after the POC's over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions.

(00:19:22):
The right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like, "Hey, how long does this process take today? How many engineers are there?" So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model. And if you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model. So a POC needs to be framed as the purpose of a POC is to build a business case, and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being a tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model.

(00:20:06):
And when you're building an ROI model, there are many buckets to focus on, but there are three that are very critical. The first one is, what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that your customer is tracking? So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the immediate, tangible, clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table.

(00:20:33):
The second bucket is cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? What are the tangible cost savings?

(00:20:41):
And the third one, which is often overlooked, is opportunity cost. For instance, if you save 10 hours of time for a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can actually use in your value selling to defend the right price.

(00:21:02):
So we talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies would you actually use. And there are a couple of strategies that we have found to be really productive.

(00:21:20):
The first one is to show up with options. Many founders rush with one product and one price and say, "Okay, this is a hundred K product, and that's what we are trying to sell." Inevitably, what will happen is the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price, and you're only talking about price.

(00:21:39):
But if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a good, better, best, if you're a hundred K product, a 200K and a 300K option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value. Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'll say, "Hey, I like the hundred K price point, but I actually like the functionality in your 200K product." Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like? Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to value as opposed to just talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price.

(00:22:18):
And showcasing options doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. I was talking to this founder who said, "Hey, I think the budget is about 100K. That's what I believe from the key stakeholder, but my product really brings crazy value. I could even charge, let's say, a 500K for this product, but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500K price because I kind of know a hundred K is the budget. What should I do?" So for those kind of situations, actually show up with options in your pricing model.

(00:22:58):
So we coached him to go in with a hundred K, plus 10% on any incremental value that you bring, or it's a 500K fixed. So now this is actually a great situation in negotiation. Because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the hundred K. It's a small fee to actually get started. But the conversation will gravitate towards, "What is that 10%? How do you measure value?" That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about, "How you add value? Where's the value generation? What portion would you take?"

(00:23:28):
And you see one of two situations. Either the customer say, "That's great. You're putting skin in the game. Let's go with a hundred K and 10%," or, 80% of the situations, you might actually want to avoid the outcome-based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500K at that point. It is the premium that you're actually paying for the certainty. So no one is focusing on the 5K because of the hundred K option on the table, and you just put a 500K and got the courage to do that. And in this specific situation, that 500K got negotiated to 400K, and they just 4X the deal compared to where they would be. So having options on the table when you negotiate is critical.

(00:24:05):
And there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book, like anchoring is important. If you start high, you'll also end up higher. And also tapering concessions. How do you give concessions? I mean, the worst negotiators will start by giving a small concession and then give a bit more when someone asks like... You might give a 5% discount, and the procurement guy says, "That's not enough." "Okay, I'll give you 10% more." "Okay, that's not enough." "I'll give you 15." What are you indicating to the other person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts.

(00:24:35):
The best negotiators who taper the concessions. So they would say, "I can give you 15%." "Okay, I need more." "I'll give you five." "I need more." "I'll give you two." So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation's actually ending. So how do you taper concessions also become important.

(00:24:51):
So when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and gets, you get better at value selling, and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're at the scale-up phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):
This is such great advice. I love that this is just one small chapter of your book. This could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have a whole thing on negotiation in a book about scaling innovation and growing your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making? Is that why you put so much effort into this part?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:25:31):
Exactly. I mean, in a B2B situation, you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models. But at least even today, it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value, how do you contextualize your price, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.

(00:25:49):
So to us, negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just negotiation tactics, like keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. This is actual negotiation strategies that are rooted on value selling, gives and gets, and focusing on extracting full value from every deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:14):
So useful. This idea of throwing out a third higher priced option, say 500K, it's so interesting. Because usually the advice I hear is like, "Just throw out twice the number you used to... " Just put it out there just in case, which is really scary to ask for like, "What about $50,000?" And this is like a much less scary way of doing that. "Okay, but we also have this 500K option. Here's what you get." And then they may be like, "Oh, that's exactly what we want." And you're like, "Oh, wow. It worked."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:40):
Exactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
That is so cool.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:44):
Put a good price point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:45):
Wow, this is awesome. This is just like a golden nugget within golden nuggets of advice. Okay. So you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:59):
Sure. We talk about how to land and expand, as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you are landing, but also expanding. We talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy, how to stop churn before it happens, how to do price increases effectively. Because at some point in your scale-up journey, you need to increase price, but how do you do that meaningful fashion?

(00:27:24):
So we have various strategies that apply both for the startup and the scale-up phase. But in combination, all of those things help you articulate and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
Awesome. Okay. Let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very different from other previous traditional pricing strategies. And it feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days, so I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:27:51):
Yeah, AI pricing is very different from the previous vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days, like day one in their seed stage pre-seed kind of thing, which was not probably the focus for the previous SaaS companies. Why is that? So because of two reasons.

(00:28:11):
One, for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from day one. But there's also a more critical reason, which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your customers to expect more for less.

(00:28:31):
So for instance, think about this. If you're building a agentic AI product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10X compared to software budgets. So if you use all the old playbooks, then you're under monetizing, again, from day one and training your customers to expect more for less. So how do you come up with foundational models that actually allow you to capture the value that you bring to the table?

(00:28:55):
And why has this become critical? Because with AI, finally, founders can really solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages... For instance, if you take Slack, you can say that the productivity went up, efficiency happened, but you cannot measure it, monitor it, attribute it to Slack. Okay, that's probably why they were in a seed-based pricing model.

(00:29:17):
But in today's situations, you see companies that say, "In a Fortune 100 company, I was able to improve throughput by 10%, reduce crap by 5%." And when you get into those kinds of situation where an AI is creating core value and it's attributable to the AI, you get a lot of pricing power.

(00:29:35):
So the two questions that we commonly hear from AI founders is, "How do I set the right pricing model?" as in, "How do I charge?" which becomes way more important than how much you charge. Because the underlining business model has changed. We have moved from software being a pay for access to now you're paying for work delivered. So the monetization model's become key. That is the first question that people actually ask us.

(00:30:05):
The second one is, "How do I navigate POCs, commercial discussions early?" Because the buyer on the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion." So those two topics become very critical, and we have showcased a lot of this in the book.

(00:31:34):
Let's talk about this POC piece because I think this is something a lot of people deal with. And then I want to talk about this two-by-two that you have in the book. And I'll actually pull it up. So let's talk about POCs first.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:31:43):
So POCs, when we talk about POCs, many founders think about a POC as a proof of technical functionality, and is their product actually working in their customer environments. And they set up the expectation that we are saying, "Hey, we are going to put the product, and we're going to see if it actually works." And they would probably say, "Should I charge for a POC versus not?" And we'll unpack that in a bit, should you or should you not.

(00:32:10):
And that's actually a completely wrong way of framing it. The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case.

(00:32:30):
So if you frame it this way is you can say, "Look, it is a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI model and building a business case along with their users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we can get to commercial discussions." So that way you've actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on co-creating a business case with the customer. And based on the business case, you can actually come up with a proper commercial agreement. And if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. So thinking about the POCs in that kind of manner.

(00:33:03):
And the question that I often get asked is, "Should I charge for a POC?" And the answer is yes, but smartly. Let's talk about why it's important to charge. The reason you need to charge for a POC is you start isolating people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who are just curious about AI. They just want to see if it works or not. They will say, "Yes, I'll engage with the POC." They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a lot of resources, never buy. You've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So having a price tag to your POC actually indicates that there is seriousness on both sides, so you should charge.

(00:33:48):
But how do you actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. What this means is that you need to make sure that your POC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because let's say if you just say it's a 10K POC for a 30-day pilot. If you don't talk about the fact that it is not the same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that, okay, it's 120K per year kind of deal if the POC works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion.

(00:34:28):
But your buyer on the other side might still push you saying, "That's all great, but I need a price or a budget, otherwise I won't move forward with it." So there are two ways to actually deflect those kind of questions. The first way is contextualize the price on the value. So you can say something like, if you're pushed for price, "Hey, for customers such as yours, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations. And our pricing is... One is to 10X when it comes to ROI."

(00:34:58):
So you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you actually didn't say it. You just said, "It's a 10 million, and I'm taking one in 10 in exchange for it." So you've given the buyer an indication, but you've framed it in such a manner that actually is justifiable, right? A one in 10X ROI. So that's one way to do it.

(00:35:16):
They might still say, "Yeah, that's good, but I need a budget." So then rather than just give them a budget saying, "It could be a 200K option," don't do that. That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like, "Look, the final pricing would be anywhere from 500K to a million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you, we can pick a point in that range that justifies the value that we bring to the table." So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way to actually go about POCs.

(00:35:46):
So how you navigate your early wins, who you choose is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the destiny for the rest of your future. And picking those early wins is very, very critical. And having buyers who are serious, lead qualifying, having the right POC process, and thinking about POCs as, frankly, not just trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value, but it's a great chance to have a commercial test-and-learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can bring to the table in terms of your value and what portion can you actually take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:26):
So the core takeaway here is, for AI companies, you no longer can just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is what you start with is what you're going to end up with, and it's very easy to under monetize because people aren't realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force savings versus just SaaS software that's making people a little bit more efficient.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:36:50):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization, and they need to master it from day one. And when we talk to early-stage founders, it is a topic that keeps many people up at night, but that's also why we wrote Scaling Innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about pricing correctly from day one. And it's become very critical for AI companies to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:16):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, I won't name names, do you think they've under monetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:37:24):
Some of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of, let's say, fast revenue growth, but is that enduring revenue? Are people actually going to stay? And is there going to be churn? And so there are a lot of aspects to marketing profitable growth. It's not just growing fast, but also growing profitably and having an enduring business. So some of them, yes, without naming names. But yeah, I think that's why it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:54):
Well, those are different. I think what you're saying here is the retention may not work for some of these companies. But on the other hand, they're really cheap. 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be 10 times more productive potentially, is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:38:11):
Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, I think there are companies that have actually done that. And they try to undo it with having more sophisticated, let's say, products that are actually higher priced or much higher priced, et cetera. That's one way to undo that situation.

(00:38:32):
So it's really a trade-off between getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book, market share and wallet share, and how do you dominate both. So if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just accelerate your market share, you're in trouble.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
Okay. This is a great segue to this two-by-two, which goes much deeper into this. So it's easy to be like, "Here's what you shouldn't do." Here's your advice on what to actually do. So I'm going to pull up on my screen this two-by-two that you have in your book. So if you're watching YouTube, you'll be able to see it.

(00:39:13):
So talk about this. This is essentially how to figure out the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:39:20):
So when you talk about AI companies and monetization models, we get asked this question. "Should I be usage-based? Should I be outcome? Should I be a copilot mode? Or how do I actually think about my pricing model?" So we came up with this framework, which is a relatively simple, straightforward framework, but very powerful.

(00:39:39):
So there are two axes here. One is attribution, and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power, and we'll come back to that in a bit, right?

(00:39:51):
So let's take the first bottom-left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a seed-based or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not being able to attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a copilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode, so a seed-based pricing would actually make sense.

(00:40:18):
But if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think about is, how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing power? So if you think about the bottom-right quadrant, those are companies that have actually done that. They can prove more attribution to what they actually bring to the table, but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode, as in there is still humans in the loop.

(00:40:43):
If you take Cursor, for instance, it definitely improves productivity, can actually bring down the time to actually do code, the attribution is clear, but it's still in a copilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid pricing model is the best option where you still have a seed-based model for the copilot kind of use case, but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are a certain number of AI credits or tokens that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more, then you're actually paying more on consumption. So it's a hybrid model that actually works there.

(00:41:18):
If you look at the top-left quadrant, those are products that are very autonomous but are not strong on attribution. So these tend to be mostly backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to run businesses, can be autonomous, but they're not directly impacting the KPIs that businesses are tracking, and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So in that situation, you need to be on a pay-for-what-you-consume and a usage-based model. A seed-based model would not make sense because it's autonomous. There's no human in the loop. But that's why you're also in a usage-based model, saying the more you use it, the more you're actually charged. And usage becomes a proxy for the value that you bring to the table.

(00:42:07):
The quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden quadrant, which is the top-right one. That's the outcome-based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered, but you're charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome-based model situation.

(00:42:35):
So a classic example here is Intercom for Fin. What they actually do is they charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to resolve the ticket completely independently without a human in the loop, then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed, they don't charge for it. So they're more on an outcome-based model. Or companies like Charge Flow would charge up to 25% on a charge bag that they're able to actually recover, because these are core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable, highly autonomous so you can start moving towards an outcome-based pricing model.

(00:43:14):
If you look at the state of where AI is today, as of the day of recording this podcast, now, the most popular model is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected, because the previous SaaS playbook was usually on the seat-based model, but they've all now moved on to at least a hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage, et cetera, about 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model as of today. But those companies, some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they actually bring to the table.

(00:43:54):
In the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.

(00:44:22):
In a lot of benchmarks and studies that actually show, and this is also my belief, that in the next three years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant because that's a magic quadrant. If you can truly price based on outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):
Wow. Okay. I'm just going to pause again. This is amazing. Madhavan, thank you so much for it. I love, again, that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff, come here, tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible.

(00:45:01):
Let me ask you this. By the way, for folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome-based pricing, Sierra, Fin, and Chargeflow. We've got the founder of Sierra and Fin coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all this with those guys.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:16):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
So is the way to use this two-by-two figuring out your model? Is it like, "Okay, I'm like Cursor. I'm going to go in this quadrant," or is it, "How do I get to outcome-based no matter what? That's where I need to be"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:32):
Yeah, so that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out what is your right archetype based on where you are today. I think that is most important. If you try to rush into an outcome-based pricing model but cannot prove attribution, you will fail. So it is really coming up with what is the right archetype based on what I'm doing today, but also use this two-by-two to say, "How do I paint a vision to actually get to outcome based? And can I get close to that? Or can I be purely an outcome-based model? How do I evolve into that?"

(00:46:05):
What that would mean is, how do I build functionality in the products to actually show attribution, how do I build more agentic workforces to take the human out of the loop and be more autonomous, and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient yourself towards more outcome-based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution, that means, first of all, understanding what are the KPIs of your customers. How do they track their business performance? Can you impact it? Can you productize things in your product that showcase that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner? Can you build dashboards to show value attribution? Can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to you? So how do you create these kind of attribution mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on building more agentic workforces that can actually be on an autonomous mold?

(00:47:04):
So pick the right archetype and plan to get to as close as you can to the outcome-based pricing model. That's how I would use the two-by-two. And you actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category... Like back in the day with GitHub, everyone, they started with a seed-based model. They've now moved to the hybrid-based pricing model with Cursors and everyone else, but the natural move would be more towards a outcome-based pricing model where a AI agent can probably code everything at the same time, debug it, and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person. And that actually becomes more closer to a outcome-based model because it's attributable and autonomous. So that is picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is the key way to interpret this two-by-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
This explains why everyone's pulling agents. That's where the money's at, what you're telling us here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:00):
Yeah. It's going to be the age of The Matrix. Too many agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Agent Smiths everywhere. They didn't turn out too great. So what I'm hearing is if I were Canva... So Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What you would do if you were helping Canva is what can you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:31):
Exactly. And a good case for that is the Fin product from Intercom. Because traditionally, all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. How many customer service agents are actually using the product? It used to be seed based, but they built out Fin, which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets. And then that actually enables them to move to the outcome-based pricing model quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
Amazing. So say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these POCs where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcome-based pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize it? What would you add to that?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:17):
Yes. I mean, at least be able to contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcome-based pricing model, be clear on the outcome that you're actually creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if your customers agree with the business case, then you can actually take a portion of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:43):
Fin, actually, they're a new sponsor of the podcast, and I learned... I didn't know this. It costs 99 cents for every support ticket they solve [inaudible 00:49:51].

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:51):
Through AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Through AI.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:53):
Exactly. If it needs a human intervention, then they don't charge for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):
Yeah. And it's just like, what? That's such a simple story. Your agent costs 20 bucks. This thing costs 99 cents

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:03):
Yeah. That is two chapters in one beautifully simple pricing and an outcome-based pricing model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:09):
And interestingly, they were the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter ones, like, "What products do you pay the most for?" and it was always Intercom. And everyone hated their pricing, and they found a solution.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:21):
I think they found a great solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):
Okay. So is there anything else along these lines that you think companies, especially AI companies, should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you'd want to share before we move on to other stuff?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:34):
I think we've covered most of the topics. Like we said, it's being thoughtful about POCs, choosing the right pricing archetype or the pricing models. Those things become very critical in the early stages. But when you start scaling and, let's say, you become a multi-product company, then you need to start focusing on, "What kind of packaging strategy should I have? Is it a platform plus add-ons? Should I have versions of the products like good, better, best? Should I tackle different use cases because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a healthcare use case? Should I productize to different use cases? Is that my packaging strategy? Or should I keep it completely modularized for people to pick and choose?"

(00:51:17):
So these kind of questions become more critical, and that's why the chapter on blowing up your packaging from your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scale-up phase become very critical. So I think that's the next thing that founders would be hit with, as in when they build multiple products, they need to think about the whole packaging, cross-selling, up-selling motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
This touches on something I was about to ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. How often is it a success to change the way you price? I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often... What does it take to successfully shift the way you price down the road if people are listening to this and are like, "Shit, we already have this pricing strategy"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:52:00):
Back in the day, we used to say that you should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, how much you're charging at least once in two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half because of the scale with which and the speed with which companies are built and competing.

(00:52:16):
So I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve it in day one, fill it, and forget it. You have to be thoughtful from day one, but also be ready to pivot, iterate, and you're going to learn along your journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test-and-learn opportunity in your early days.

(00:52:38):
And there are things that you would change more often, and there are things that you probably don't want to change too often. Things like pricing model, unless you really changed your attribution autonomy, there is no need to shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse things.

(00:52:54):
But there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been six months a year? Yeah, you should. Because in a year there's probably prices go up three to 5% for everything that you consume. But how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price increases smartly become very important in the scale-up phase.

(00:53:16):
I think Warren Buffett summarized this really well. He said the true definition of a company is a pricing power. And if you have a prayer session for doing a 10% price increase, you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn, but you're also able to pass on the increase as a value exchange, those things become critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
Awesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three referred axioms from the book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:53:55):
You talked about Sierra being in your park founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but here's a shout-out for Clay. So Clay actually read the entire book and gave me feedback, Scaling Innovation, the similar copy that he actually had. I called it Scaling Innovation Axioms throughout the book. And the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day, if you can just take all the axioms, put it in a printout next to your desk is the summary of the book. And it's like PT statements that you'll just remember what to do.

(00:54:26):
So he came up with this idea that, "Hey, rather than calling them just generic scaling innovation axioms, you need to brand each and every axiom." And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So I went about coming up with a unique... He even contributed to some of the names. We came up with some unique names for each axiom.

(00:54:45):
And here's the other fun fact. Probably I'm geeking out too much. But when I counted the number of axioms, there were 42 axioms. And I didn't try to make this up. And if you're a Hitchhiker's fan, then you know that's the answer to everything.

(00:54:58):
But jokes apart, let me unpack a few axioms. One of my first favorite axioms, what I call is the 20-80 axiom. Especially in tech companies, 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that the 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they take this 20%, build it, put it out in the market almost for free, and then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not been thoughtful about that, you've given the farm away unintentionally.

(00:55:37):
So truly understanding what drives willingness to pay in your product is critical. And I think people call it the MVP. I think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product, it should be the most valuable product. And be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early products I think is key. That's the 20-80 axiom.

(00:55:58):
Probably my second one is the price paralysis axioms. So what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's not external and logical. This goes back to the same prayer session to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business. So it's mostly internal and emotional, and how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.

(00:56:29):
Probably my third favorite one is stopping churn before it happens, so stopping churn axiom. So to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? Most companies will try to stop churn when someone actually says, "I want to go." It is too late, and you're being reactive. At the most, you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another six months, and they will leave. They've already made that determination.

(00:56:59):
The way to stop churn is to start acquiring customers who won't leave. And that is the most important thing. So if you look back at your data and say, "Who are the types of customers who actually tend to stay longer? What are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of those?" then you stop churn before it happens. And that's the key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
That's interesting. I'm surprised you didn't say what was my favorite, which is... I think it's like, "If you land, make sure to expand."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That one really stuck with me.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:29):
That's a good one, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
Maybe talk about that one. Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:32):
Sure. I mean, so if you land, you need to also make sure you're expanding, in the sense that if you give the farm away in your entry-level product, you don't have much to actually monetize later. So being thoughtful about what is the fence between your land product. Is it a free experience? What is the getting? And the getting is typically based on are you getting based on features? Are you also getting on usage? And how do you be thoughtful about that? So you leave stuff for the expansion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
Okay. So zooming out even further, to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away that they think they understand but they probably don't?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:58:14):
Yeah, I think this comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share and wallet share if they're growing. And even if you ask them, they'll say like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about wallet share," but have they really thought about it equally and paid equal attention? Have they postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single-engine strategy consciously or subconsciously? I think that's the key takeaway I have.

(00:58:40):
So the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company, you might need to be more market share dominating. In certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort, but it's equal attention and really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect. And that is the main takeaway that I have for people. And if you are not in that mindset already, there's a book for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
I'll point them to it. So just so folks know what to do when they're like, "Okay, I need to focus on wallet share more," is the main focus figure out a pricing model that aligns well with pricing power, what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in wallet-share thinking?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:59:28):
So it's actually all of those. Market share, wallet share, acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do. If you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share... Let's say, for instance, you need to have the right land-and-expand strategy. The land helps you with acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share.

(00:59:54):
If you have a pricing model, then you need to have a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive, but it should also help you recover value, which is like your monetization. And if people understand your pricing model, they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort of goes hand in hand. So I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful. Because if you follow those strategies, you are not going to fall into the single-engine strap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
All right. That is a very reasonable answer. Madhavan, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:00:41):
Read the two books in sequence, Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. Because it's one thing to build a great product, it's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a not-so-great product, and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's thinking about pricing early, especially for AI companies, being thoughtful about it, price before product, and then thinking about how to actually scale, developing a profitable growth mindset. All of these things become critical. And I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
I feel like your books are in the staple of founder reading. There's all these things you just don't know what you're doing. And there's a few of these books that are like, "Okay, here's all this advice that'll answer so many questions and save you so much heartache." And so I'm really excited you're adding something to that bookshelf. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:16):
Okay. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):
Let's go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:41):
The first one that comes to mind is Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It's a classic and one of my favorite books. I recommend a lot of people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also seeing from a more strategic business model angle.

(01:01:57):
I like this book, Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I think that's also a classic because, again, there's always a human element to things. And understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're in B2C or in B2B. Because if you're in a B2B situation, it's humans having a human conversation. So it's as much behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I love that book, and there's a lot of nuggets in there, so I recommend a lot.

(01:02:20):
And probably the third one that I recommend is a book called Contagious by Jonah Berger. I love that. He was in the PhD program at Stanford in marketing, and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral. And he's actually seen the best viral messages and boiled it down to a framework. And if you follow that, then you can make those messages viral. And I've tried to use some of those in my own outreaches and things of that nature, so I think it's a fantastic read.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
Wow.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:52):
Have you read it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Got to check this out. I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. We're going to go viral because we got the playbook.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:57):
Contagious. That's the name of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Contagious. Okay. We'll link to that. Is there a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:04):
I guess a movie. Sure, let's pick a movie. Definitely enjoyed Mission Impossible, the final one, eighth in the sequence. I think I find that a whole... I love those, the entire genre, one through eight. But what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would've probably gone and seen it, when I wanted to. So I thought that's an interesting example of a durable brand where your monetization power actually increase over a period of time. So I think I enjoyed the movie. It was great. Yeah.

(01:03:43):
Hey, by the way, I just realized MI stands for Monetizing Innovation and also Mission Impossible. Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:52):
And you're the Tom Cruise character.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:53):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):
I love how you're the only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through a monetization, willingness-to-pay lens.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:00):
Exactly. I think there's too many of these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and monetization. I think it's become my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh, man. We need a version of this movie, like a Mission Possible of Madhavan.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:14):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:14):
I'd pay anything for that. All right. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:22):
I would probably talk about two products. The first one is Delphi, the Digital Mind representation. There's a Lennybot that you actually, I think, put out. I find that product fascinating, and I also love the founders, Dara and Sam there. I truly believe that that is going to be the future for thought leadership and how thoughts are consumed by consumers.

(01:04:46):
And I've used your Lennybot. I really enjoy it, like if I can co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I really love the product category. There's a lot of different use cases, longevity, extension, use cases, things of that nature. I'm excited about the product. I think it's been great. I plan to, taking inspiration from you, plan to create a Delphi of myself-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay. I was going to ask.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:15):
... at some point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:16):
I think it should be [inaudible 01:05:17]-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):
So that one would... Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:18):
... the book maybe. I'll try to. That's the promise. Try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about the book or things of that nature and talk pricing, you can talk to my AI, too, right? I mean, I find the product fascinating.

(01:05:31):
The second one I would probably say that's been super useful in terms of just productivity is Granola. We love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and during all the meetings and organize it and being able to query things, et cetera. I think it's been a great product that we recently started trying and we've been really liking it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Cool. That's been the most mentioned product recently. How cool is that? Love Granola. Get a year free of Granola if you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com. Click bundle, one year free for not just you, your whole team. What an offer they offered. It's crazy.

(01:06:05):
On Delphi, what's interesting about LennyBot is it's not just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons also fed into it. What an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point, completely free. Lennybot.com. No, I get nothing from it. It's just out there.

(01:06:24):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:06:32):
Create value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow. That's my life motto.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
That resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is it used to be very expensive to work with at Simon-Kucher, I think it was called. Very expensive. A lot of big company stuff. Now a lot of more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups. So just talk about that. Talk about what you're doing these days.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:07:00):
Sure. I mean, at Simon-Kucher, I got to work with over 250 companies. And my co-GP now, Josh Bloom, he also had an opportunity to work with our 250 companies. So combined, we worked with our 500 companies, more than 50-plus unicorns. It was a great ride.

(01:07:16):
And often, we were actually working with them in much later stages when series D or pre-IPO, post-IPO, private equity companies, et cetera. But the two of us actually now started a venture firm with an explicit goal of working with early-stage AI founders. And it goes back to the topic that we started with. AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But for those kind of companies, fee-for-service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. And that's also why we pivoted to venture.

(01:07:51):
So our business model is pretty standard right now. You get access in the cap table. We roll up our sleeves and work with the founders in all things monetization. So we are invested in their success and we will partake in the value creation. There's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to concentrate our efforts in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies, and that's where we will be spending our time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
What a deal. Madhavan, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:08:25):
Ways to find out, I think just google for Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon, I think, if you want to purchase the books. Actually, Scaling Innovation is now available in pre-order. I think we'll have the pod released before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order.

(01:08:48):
And maybe I will take an inspiration from your master bundle, which I really think is the world's best bundle, and come up with my own bundle for getting users to pre-order. So if you love Monetizing Innovation, I can tell you you would really love Scaling Innovation. So go buy it for your teams. Buy it for yourself.

(01:09:06):
And here's the offer. So for anyone who's able to buy more than five copies, send us a screenshot of your purchase pre-order, right? Send us a screenshot of your purchase to promo@49palmsvc.com. So that's promo, as in promotion, @49 P-A-L-M-S-V-C .com.

(01:09:30):
And here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to bundles as a raffle, and the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, a 30-minute ask-me-anything session, an exclusive invite for a Scaling Innovation book launch, and also a Scaling Innovation t-shirt. So that's my coming up with a bundle. I didn't get Granola and others to put in for me just yet, but I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks to buy.

(01:10:01):
And, yeah. I mean if you like the book, please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful. Because if more people review it, the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community for Monetizing Innovation. I think there's been, over the last eight years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, posting on LinkedIn, and making things like price before product or product market price fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So I'm very passionate that people actually did that and very thankful for them. So there's also probably an equal measure. If you're excited about Scaling Innovation, I would love for you to talk about the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
Amazing. And I think the reason people do that is because you give away so much for free. You just shared so much wisdom for free that is going to help so many people, so it all comes back to you.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:05):
I just tried to plan my give and get right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
There we go. Oh my God. A good callback. Madhavan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:13):
Thank you so much, Lenny. Was a pleasure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):
Same. Bye, everyone.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):
I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce. One of the most legendary launch events in startup history. Just looking back at that, any lessons from what you did right to get people to pay attention?

Marc Benioff (00:09):
I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17):
Your stock is at an all-time high. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow.

Marc Benioff (00:24):
I actually never look at the stock. I find the stock to be very distracting. The stock isn't the goal. That's not why we're doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30):
AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime. When was the moment for you where you started to realize this?

Marc Benioff (00:38):
I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44):
As a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (00:50):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01):
Today, my guest is Marc Benioff. He's co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, which is the second largest B2B SaaS company in the world worth around $350 billion at the time of this recording, making $35 billion a year in revenue, and 25 years later, is still growing like crazy and dominating the market. In our conversation, we talk about leadership, AI, domain names, beginner's mind, marketing, product, sales, the hardest moment in Marc's journey of building Salesforce. Also, what exactly is an agent and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

(03:57):
Marc, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Marc Benioff (04:00):
Excited to finally get connected with you and excited to do this podcast with you too.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:04):
I'm even more excited, and I actually want to start with something that I think most people don't know about you, but to me, it's almost like a microcosm of how far ahead you look and almost how... basically, how visionary you are, and that's that you've owned a number of epic domain names. For example, bill.com, you.com-

Marc Benioff (04:26):
You.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:26):
... code.com, appstore.com. First of all, are there others I don't know about?

Marc Benioff (04:28):
There's a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Marc Benioff (04:32):
That all came from... I'll tell you. It's a good story actually because what happened was I was working at Oracle for 10 years from 1986, and 1996 rolled around like it was a snap of the fingers. All of a sudden, I realized, "Whoa, what has just happened to the last decade?" The decade just flew by. It was crazy. It was a big moment for me in my career, and I had a... It was a huge acceleration. I went from being a kid right out of college to working for Larry Ellison. But after 10 years, I was pretty trashed, and so I said to Larry, "Hey, I need to go and take some time off."

(05:13):
So I went to Hawaii and rented a little house on the beach. I had done some angel investing, and it was a cool moment where some of my companies started to go public, including Siebel Systems and others, and Saba Software, and people I had met at Oracle like Tom Siebel and Bobby Yazdani. Then, I was just fascinated at that point with the internet. I had been working on it at Oracle for a couple years, so I started buying a bunch of domain names of companies that I thought companies. They weren't companies yet. Now, they are companies. But ideas that I thought the names would be great companies one day and reflected where I thought things were going. Yeah. It's a long time ago now. It's a really long, long time ago. I think almost 30 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:00):
So one of the domain names you owned was appstore.com, which I know you gifted to Steve Jobs, I read in your book. Is there a story there that you could share because that's an epic domain just to gift?

Marc Benioff (06:09):
It's a great story, but it's really a story about my relationship with Steve Jobs. When I was in college in 1984, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Apple. I wrote the first native assembly language on the Macintosh. It's a crazy thing to be able to say, but it's true that I was writing these example programs for this Macintosh 68000 Development System on these Apple headquarter buildings in Bandley, Bandley Road in Cupertino and started to have a relationship with Steve Jobs in that... Not that I was actually talking to him. I was like this snot-nosed 19-year-old kid, but he's running around the building. We have this refrigerator over here with all these fruit juices. There's a masseuse over here doing shots and massages. There's a motorcycle in the lobby. There's a pirate flag on the roof, and there's Steve Jobs running around, yelling at everybody, and it was freaking cool.

(07:10):
Okay. So you can just imagine like you're like, "Whoa, this is like I'm in a movie." There's a lot of other cool parts of a movie too that were going on, and it started my relationship with him, and then I actually got to know him then as I eventually got to Oracle. Then, eventually, I started Salesforce, and I had this moment at Salesforce. It was, I think, 2000, 2001. I cannot remember exactly what it was, and we were at the opening of one of his movies for Pixar, and we're having dinner. There's a lot of details around the dinner. It'll be a hugely long story if I go forever.

(07:56):
He says to me, "Well, Marc, now, listen to me. You're doing so great. You've got your company, Salesforce. If you need any help, you make sure you call me, okay?" I'm like, "Yes, sir. I will do that." He took out his... He had just introduced the iPod, and he's like, "I got a thousand songs in my pocket here. Look at this, and that, and all that." It's this cool device. I'm like, "That's such a cool screen. Steve." He goes, "Oh, thanks so much." I go, "Steve, you could do movies on there too, not just... or photos. You didn't have to do songs." "No, Marc. I will never do a device like that. Absolutely not."

(08:34):
That's a little insight into his personality that he would never ever exactly say, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to do the movie device that have the photo, the phone, the this." So, anyway. Things were moving along at Salesforce, and so I was like, "I'm stuck, and I need to get through my block, writer's block, entrepreneur's block. I'm going to reach out to him." He's like, "Come down here right away."

(09:03):
So, literally, I got in my car, brought a few of my team with me, and we go down, and he's like, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're blocked. There's three things you need to do right now." I'm like, "Okay. What are they?" He go, "Your company, it better get 10 times larger than it is now in 24 months or it's over." "Oh, okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir." "Number two, you better sign a huge customer for this Salesforce automation product like Avon. They're a great salesforce." The CEO of Avon was on his board at the time, so that was on his mind. "And one last thing I'm going to tell you you must do." I'm like, "Yes, sir. What is it?" "You better go build an application economy." "An application economy?" "Yes." "What does that mean?" "I don't know, but you're going to go figure it out."

(09:55):
It was like meeting with your guru and getting a Zencon or something where you're... Now, you have a puzzle I have to solve. I literally went away, and I had all the notes from the meeting. I went through it over and over again. Then, finally, I'm like, "I think he wants me to build an app store." At that moment, I went to the domain registry, and I bought appstore.com. Then, I started working on it at Salesforce so that we would have the ability with our platform to build apps, and then sell them, and that you could do all these things.

(10:34):
So I did all that and launched AppExchange in 2005 or 2006. We didn't call it App Store because when we tested the App Store name in focus groups, customers are like, "This is not an app store. This is an app exchange. We're all going to exchange apps and capabilities with each other." Anyway, it rolled out, iPhone rolled out, and then he basically said to me one day, "Hey, come down and see me." This is maybe a year after iPhone. I'm like, "I'll be right down."

(11:08):
I get down there, and I have some team members with me. They'd heard this story before, et cetera, and then we're sitting there like this in the Apple Auditorium. It's not like in a hotel or anything. I remember it very clearly like it was yesterday. He said, "I brought you all down here today." It's very good theatrical performance. I could never do what he does. It's incredible. He's got the thing, and then he says, "And I'm here to reveal to you the App Store." All of our people go, "Huh." They're doing break breath, and they're all like... go white because they're like, "Oh, Marc has been talking about App Store for years. How could Steve even..."

(11:51):
Then, at the end of it... It's all over. Everyone leaves the auditorium. They're all going out to play with the App Store and all these things. I walked down. He's sitting down there by himself working on something. He's in the corner of the stage. I go, "Hey, Steve. Can I talk to you for a second?" He goes, "Of course." Very generous with me. Very kind with me. I go, "Steve, I'm going to give you a gift." "Wow, but Marc, what are you are going to give me?" "Steve, I'm going to give you something you don't have, but maybe you'll need, which is the appstore.com URL, appstore.com, and the trademark for App Store because after that meeting we had six years ago, I ended up trademarking these things and buying this URL." He's like, "Oh, it's very nice, but you know this App Store thing isn't going to be very big. Whatever, but thank you very much." That was the story of App Store. It's amazing. It was a very amazing relationship that I had with him. Very grateful to have that relationship and dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.

Lenny Rachitsky (12:59):
There's one thread that I love about everything you shared. Here is how generosity was at the center of so much of this, him helping you, you helping him, just wanting to help each other.

Marc Benioff (13:08):
He is a very generous person, and I'll tell you that he never turned down anything that I asked him to do. I have so many stories, but one story was I was thinking about buying this house, and I wasn't sure should I buy this house, Should I not buy this house, whatever, and so he went... He said, "I'll go look at it for you." So he went, he is looking at this house, and then he calls me, and he goes, "Well, I don't know if you should do this or that, but this might be good. Maybe it is good. Maybe it is a good idea."

(13:41):
Then, I'm emailing with him after that, and he's very sick, and it's all very sad. Then, he sends me an email, and the last email he sent to me was he said... I said, "Wow. Well, this has worked out better than I thought." He goes, "Marc, everything has worked out so much better than we could have ever imagined." It was just a beautiful thought and incredibly sad all at the same moment, and that was my last correspondence with him.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:14):
I feel like we could do Steve Jobs stories all day.

Marc Benioff (14:16):
Yeah. Oh, no, I have hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:19):
Yes, you can.

Marc Benioff (14:20):
I have a lot of Steve Jobs stories, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (14:21):
Oh, man.

Marc Benioff (14:22):
Yeah. Anyway, those are a couple of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:24):
By the way, I also love that he had B2B SaaS advice here like, "You need a big customer. You need to hire ACVs, build the marketplace."

Marc Benioff (14:30):
Oh, he hated those. He hated SaaS, and he hated that I was doing enterprise software.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:31):
Yeah, he did.

Marc Benioff (14:35):
He's trying to talk me out of being an enterprise software executive. He's like, "Now, Marc, what are you going to do? You're going to go home and tell your kids that you're working on enterprise software? Who do you sell to, CIOs? Have you had met them? How can you be doing this? I can't imagine a more horrible career." I'm like, "I love it, Steve." "No, Marc, you cannot love this. This is not great." It was really a funny thing. He really disliked that, but yet, he was incredibly supportive of me. He would call me all the time. It was really amazing, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:06):
Yeah. It feels like a place he was wrong in the end here, which is cool, cool to know. I want to go in a different direction.

Marc Benioff (15:12):
He was rarely wrong, by the way, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:14):
He was rarely wrong with B2B SaaS. $350 billion of value. Who would've known it existed? Speaking of that, so I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce and when you launched Salesforce. It's crazy to think back to that when basically, you were trying to convince people the future of software was not desktop software, it was going to be in the cloud, it was SaaS. You had all these end of software logos. You had mascots walking around with this no software thing. You hired fake protesters at... I think it was Siebel's conference. It was very hard.

Marc Benioff (15:44):
I think you read one of my books, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:46):
I know the history of a lot of these things.

Marc Benioff (15:48):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:49):
It's one of the most legendary launch events in startup history, so I've heard of it many times at this point.

Marc Benioff (15:54):
It was a crazy moment. I mean, Siebel, who was really the enterprise software company doing CRM, was doing a user conference. I was looking for an opportunity to launch our product, so we hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco, and San Francisco is very woke, so people expect a good protest. So we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, "The end of software is near," and all kinds of other... "No software," and all these things. We had a lot of funny things on signs. We were running a protest outside of Siebel that they were in the software business, but we were like, "Oh, no, we've got to get out of software. We've got to create the end of software." So we have picketers outside of the streets.

(16:50):
Anyway, he comes out himself out of the building and really gets super upset. Right then, we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters. So now he thinks that it's a media thing. He calls the police. He got very upset. He's a great guy. By the way, I love Tom Siebel. I think he's also one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. He's just fuming, and he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't exactly know it's us, and we're just having the best time. That night, we had our huge launch event at one of the top theaters in San Francisco. We hired a great band, and it was really... We just had so much fun. It was just a really great time. That was all happened. I remember very well. It was February 22nd of 2001 or 2000, 2000, February 22nd, 2000.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:06):
I love this. I haven't heard that interview, the reporter part of that story before.

Marc Benioff (18:10):
It was crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:12):
I love it, and it sounds frivolous potentially, but I think the genius of this that I want to touch on is-

Marc Benioff (18:18):
"Frivolous" is a good word. It probably was frivolous.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:21):
So what I imagine is you're trying to get people to even know Salesforce exists, to differentiate, to get the name out, and I feel like that's something a lot of founders struggle with. They don't really know how to get their name out, how to get people to pay attention. Just looking back at that success, I guess, just any lessons from what you did right to get the word "Salesforce" out to get people to pay attention at all to what you were doing?

Marc Benioff (18:42):
Well, it's a noisy world, Lenny, and you can see that. You can get on Twitter. It's like... I mean, there's a lot of noise, and how do you break through? We have that challenge today. We're introducing a huge new product called Agentforce. I've only been working on it for a couple months now. I introduced it at our Dreamforce Conference, and that was one way to break through, which was I took our conference and said, "It's just going to be about Agentforce." I'm trying to think about, "What are all the things I need to do to get my company 100% on Agentforce, my customers, everyone?" because I know I have a window of opportunity here.

(19:25):
We're first, we're ahead. We have hundreds of customers on this now. We're on it, which is amazing. We've moved our whole help infrastructure to Agentforce. We're seeing incredible results. We've cut our human escalation from our support infrastructure down by 50%. We're resolving 83% of all of our inquiries robotically. It's incredible. So, now, how do I get that message out? How do I do it globally? How do I find my KNMS moment where I can come up with something that's viral and exciting?

(20:04):
I'm trying lots of different things. I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, "We'll cut ads for you." They have not been together in an ad ever, and they haven't done anything together since True Detective. They're friends of mine. Again, very generous people to agree to do this. We've shot three ads so far. I put them out on Twitter to get feedback from folks. Is this a good idea?

(20:35):
I am running this help.salesforce.com to show what we can do with it. Is that a good idea? I'm training all my salespeople in how to sell it. Is that a good idea? I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against. Is that a good idea? Should I be marketing and positioning against them?

(20:58):
I'm trying lots of things, and what I'm trying to do, Lenny, is what I recommend to all entrepreneurs. The message is really in the medium here, which is that I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy. I don't know actually which one of those things is going to be the most important thing in launching this product, so I'm trying a lot of things with that old expression. I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. Then, once I find that thing, I will then grow that as my strategy, and that is what I'm trying to do.

(21:33):
I'm even expanding my distribution organization. I'm trying to hire an additional one to 2,000 account executives just to focus on Agentforce. So I'm trying to do everything I can to get that light switch to go on where I can show customers this is an incredible opportunity to lower your cost, to make things better, and to show that for the first time, we can have digital labor, that Salesforce isn't just managing your data, but we're a digital labor provider. So this is that moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (22:03):
There's so much there that I love, this idea of trying a bunch of things, looking for the tactic that becomes your strategy. It feels like also there's this focus of just go all in and focus on this one thing, and then try a bunch of different ways for this one thing that you're focused on to win. There's also an element of... I just had Seth Godin on the podcast, and one of his big lessons is be remarkable. Create something people remark about. So this celeb-oriented ad that you're working on, I think, is a really good example of that.

Marc Benioff (22:31):
Well, that is a key thought though that he's saying, which is you got to find it, but finding that is the hard part, so you got to be like... One of my friends is Chris Rock, the comedian. So what he'll do is he just doesn't go out and do a Netflix special with all of his jokes. He's out there testing his jokes in clubs and doing all kinds of crazy things. I won't go through all the crazy stuff he does to test his jokes, but by the time it gets to the big Netflix special, he knows what works and what doesn't work. So that is something that we all have to do as entrepreneurs. We need to be testing lots of things. We need a lot of experimentation, and we can't be too arrogant.

(23:15):
I think another thing that's extremely important is... I have a pretty deep meditation practice for three, four decades which is we have to be cultivating our beginner's mind. We have to use our mindfulness in a way to clear everything out and then get back to, "What is my beginner's mind?" In the beginner's mind, I have every possibility, but in the expert's mind, I have few, and in some cases, maybe none. So I've been doing this a long time. I've been writing software since I'm 15. I'm now 60. That's 45 years. I don't want to have an expert's mind. I want to have a beginner's mind, and how do I have that beginner's mind? Because those ideas will come at me if I can go, "What could work?" rather than saying, "Oh, I know what is going to work," or, "This is the one thing that is going to definitely work," or, "We have to do this."

(24:10):
As soon as you start using words like that, you know that you're going to completely implode and fail. You have to say, "Here, we have to do all these things." Like in my company right now, we just did this all-hands call. I was like, "There's six things I really want to get done," but one thing is I didn't get everybody focused on Agentforce and really watch the energy. Number two is I need to find more fuel in the company to fuel this idea because this is clearly a breakthrough product, so how do I get everyone focused on it? Number three, where I think it's really important, we need more distribution capability. We don't sell through franchises. We're not selling through dealers, resellers. We sell direct, so I know I need more account executives.

(24:56):
Number four is I need to be telling lots of customer stories. So, number one, customer zero, me, and number two is I need to tell you all the stories. Like, you can see the story of Disney. I'm doing a huge amount of AI work for them and Agentforce work. Let me tell you the story about Disney. I need to tell you that story, and then we have this whole ecosystem of people around the company called Trailblazers, millions of them, who know our platform. They all have to become agentblazers.

(25:23):
The last thing is I just shipped the product into all 135,000 Salesforce customers. So it's their nascent, and they need to flick it on. I need to motivate them to turn it on. These are the six things I'm thinking about all the time. So it's not just one thing. I'm trying to figure out what it is, and I need a beginner's mind to assess how do I move forward, how do I evolve, how do I inspire, how do I motivate, how do I energize.

(26:57):
I love this idea of beginner's mind. I imagine it's very difficult to operationalize, especially for a company at 25 years old at this point. Obviously, you meditate. You put a lot of effort and focus into building this. It's hard to do that within a company. Is there anything you do with meetings, with leadership, with the way you operate that spreads this way of thinking within the org?

Marc Benioff (27:18):
Well, Salesforce is now the second largest software company in the world, but also the second largest software company in Japan, and that's a country where I put a lot of time and energy into. I love going there. I love going to Kyoto. When I go to Kyoto, I like to go to some of these amazing Zen temples. By the way, that's one of the things that Steve Jobs love to do, and he used to go to these great sushi restaurants. There's a great one in Kyoto named Sushiiwa. If you go in there, you'll see he's signed something for them. It says, "All good things. Steve Jobs." I said, "What did he do over here?" He would go to this great sushi restaurant, and then he would go to Ryōan-ji, the Rock Garden Temple. Incredible metaphysical temple.

(28:04):
I've gone there. I've gone there for decades. I've brought a lot of friends of mine there. Yeah. You got to clear your mind and let it come in. You got to receive it. You need to listen. I remember I even brought Neil Young there, the musician. He's one of my favorite people in the world, and obviously, I love his music. His soundtrack is the soundtrack of my entire life. We were sitting there, and he was so deep in meditation, and then he started walking around. The temple was closing, and then he was in the zone, and I didn't want to bother him, but I'm like, "You know, I think we got to go."

(28:38):
Anyway, it turned out he had written a whole album while we were there in his head, and he was basically transcribing it all. This incredible creative process. Look, we're all writing an album in our head. What album are you writing? What music are you writing? How are you getting into that zone yourself? You want to be a great entrepreneur. You want to be a great CEO. You got to clear your mind, and you got to be ready to write that music.

(29:06):
That music could be your business plan, your product plan, your product launch plan like we're talking about for my Agentforce product. That's what we're all trying to do, and I use a place like Kyoto as a place to do that also because geography is important. Where you are matters. I know you're in Marin, so Marin County. Maybe you can go out to the top of Mount Tam. Maybe you go to Spirit Rock with Jack Kornfield and go clear your mind there, but you got to find the place to do that and create the location. It may not be in the office. It may be somewhere else.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:41):
By the way, you have the most amazing friends list. All these folks you mentioned, I've met.

Marc Benioff (29:41):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:49):
I don't know how long this goes. [inaudible 00:29:49].

Marc Benioff (29:48):
They are cool. I am lucky that I've met a lot of cool people. Yeah. I don't know how I got so lucky to meet some of these people.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:53):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about... Every month or so, I hear about a startup, I do a bunch of angel investing, that's trying to basically disrupt Salesforce, come after Salesforce. They bash your... don't kill me for saying this, your user experience. They're like, "Oh, so complicated. It's been around three to five years."

Marc Benioff (30:11):
We are too complicated. I agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:12):
Okay. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow. We're recording this today, and your stock is at an all-time high basically even now.

Marc Benioff (30:25):
Wow, I didn't even know that.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:27):
Roughly.

Marc Benioff (30:29):
I actually never look at the stock.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (30:31):
I find the stock to be very distracting, and I encourage my employees also don't look at the stock because the stock is just a reflection. Money isn't the goal, right? The stock isn't the goal. It's coming at the end of the journey. It's like that's not why we're doing this. The journey is the reward. That's also something Steve Jobs would say all the time. Another bow to Steve Jobs here. I think that this is really important, and I look at myself as a startup.

(31:05):
I am a startup CEO. I'm a startup entrepreneur. I'm still at the beginning of Salesforce. No matter what I'm doing at Salesforce, whether I'm the CEO, I'm sometimes the chair of the board. Like, last week, we had a board meeting. Sometimes I'm a product manager. This is a startup, and we're a 25-year-old, 75,000-person, $38 billion, $300 something billion market cap startup, but we're a startup nonetheless. We have some great products, but we are just starting. As an example, Lenny, we are just starting the digital labor industry, and we have a product called Agentforce, and we are just starting. We are just at the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:47):
I want to bounce around a little bit, but let's talk about Agentforce. I know this is, as you've said, the thing you're most focused on right now. It's a big bet you all are taking. When people hear this word "agent," I think a lot of people are embarrassed to even ask like, "What does that even look like? What is an agent beyond what LLMs are today?" Is there an example you could give of something you've seen that maybe blew your mind of what an agent can do?

Marc Benioff (32:09):
Yeah. I saw it in the movies. I saw it in Minority Report, which was a movie that was co-written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz. Tom Cruise runs into the Gap store, and all of a sudden, it says, "Hey. Hey, Tom. Have you thought about this new shirt? Look at these jeans. You bought this last time. Now, you could try this. You could try that. What about this? What about that?" It knew his history. It understood him. It knew what was going on. This is 20 years ago. This whole store changes digitally to reflect his interest, his ideas, and it's starting to talk to him and work with him.

(32:51):
That is an agent. It isn't just the agent that we saw in the Matrix, Mr. Smith, or whatever it is. It's someone that's working with you, someone. That's an interesting, for you, slip. It's something that is working with you. It could be your piece of software in your phone. It could be a robot that's going to be in your home. It could be your car that knows you, understands your preferences, has an institutional memory of you, and now is helping to advise you.

(33:22):
I'll give you an example that I'm going to... I go into UCSF all the time. I'm actually just getting through an Achilles rupture right now, so I've had a lot of interactions, and the hospital... or you're getting your healthcare, getting your labs done, getting your physical done, getting your scans done, whatever it is. There's always these pre-operative and post-operative or pre-procedure and post-procedure things, and you're getting these phone calls. Every time I get a phone call, I'm like, "Ugh, that probably just cost them a hundred bucks, and we probably could do that a lot cheaper and a lot easier with an agent."

(33:58):
Then, when I talk to my doctors and nurses at UCSF, they're all burnt out post-pandemic because they're scheduling pajama time to go through all their digital messages at night. It's like a lot of this could be done a lot easier with agents and AI, and we're going to make their lives a lot better, a lot easier, simpler. Some of those things that they're doing, they don't need to talk to me about what my cholesterol number is because I got my labs, and the cholesterol number is this number or that number. A lot of this can be done with technology, and then save the parts that are important for them like when I come to see them or I want to have a real, deeper, more empathetic conversation face-to-face with a deeply experienced doctor. That's a whole another opportunity for me.

(34:45):
That is an agent or the agent is like... Here's an example. I had a CT scan, and you have to drink this contrast, and then all of a sudden, the... drink it, but they give it to you through an IV, and then they're taking better pictures. But then, you have to drink water to flush the contrast out of your body. Do you think anyone called me and said, "Hey, did you drink the water?" No, nobody calls me to drink the water. You have to remember. You're on your own in healthcare in the US. So the agent is going to call you and say, "Hey, did you drink the water? Did you take your meds? Do you need to have a repeat lab? Do you need to go see your doctor again?" So the agent is going to be there by your side. So that's an healthcare example. There's a lot of examples that we can probably have.

Lenny Rachitsky (35:25):
There's just a story in The New York Times which isn't about agents specifically. It was about comparing ChatGPT to a doctor where they tested a doctor's ability to diagnose versus a ChatGPT directly or a doctor plus ChatGPT. By far, the best was just ChatGPT, removing the doctor from the equation.

Marc Benioff (35:43):
Yeah. They wrote up a clinical study where they actually did look at, in a semi-peer-reviewed way, that ChatGPT, in many cases, was giving more accurate diagnoses than a doctor because the doctor had a more bias coming in working with the patient. So that's super interesting and I think something that we should probably all look at that study and think about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (36:09):
Speaking of The New York Times, there's actually this quote I found. You did this op-ed talking about AI. So the quote is, "Throughout my career in Silicon Valley, I've witnessed numerous waves of innovation, but none compared to the profound impact of AI. AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime." When was the moment for you where you started to realize this where it's like, "Oh shit, this is not just another cool toy?"

Marc Benioff (36:33):
Well, I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI, and it's happened over a series of decades. But for those of us who grew up with these movies like WarGames and Minority Report or Her or... across the board or read some of these books. One of my favorite books on AI is Ghost Fleet. You think about, "Where are we going with AI? Where are we going with AI?" With Salesforce, I think about our journey, and I've been waiting for this to happen and trying to bring us along, especially in the last decade with the development of our Einstein platform, and now the development of our Agentforce platform.

(37:18):
This week, at Salesforce, we'll probably do about 2 trillion AI transactions. With our total now, Einstein and Agentforce platforms, we're definitely the largest provider of enterprise AI transactions in the world as far as I could tell, and I keep thinking, "Wow, this is going to get more and more intense." One step was we had to automate all these customer touch points. So like wearing my Disney fanboy shirt here, we run the Disney Store and the Disney Guides, and there's Disney Real Estate, and there's the DisneyQuest call center, and there's... Every aspect of Disney. When you're a customer, you're interfacing with Salesforce.

(38:00):
So that's what we've loved doing, automating all these customer touch points: sales, service, marketing, analytics, Slack, integrating it all with MuleSoft. That's what we do, and then aggregating it all into a big database where we call it data cloud, and then federating that data cloud to other data sources. So that's the two steps we've been doing, automate the customer touch points, aggregate the data, and then step three is the agentic platform on top of that.

(38:29):
When you think about what's happening now that you can go to help.salesforce.com and have your issues resolved with that on the agentic layer, that's amazing. Then, the fourth layer that will come will be the robotic drone layer where those robots and drones will then feed off of the platform and all of these capabilities. That vision of the future is something that we've all had in the industry for years. It's not my magic vision. This is a vision that's been around. It's been the fundamentals of computer science that we would move from having... We'd go from data to automation, and that is what we're all driving, and we're driving that industry. We're going lower cost, easier to use, and more automated constantly. That's powerful. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:21):
You mentioned Einstein briefly. I'll also mention my dog is named Einstein, and I got Einstein swag once with the socks, and I love them, so. Also, that's also an example of you bought einstein.com very early.

Marc Benioff (39:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:34):
That was another domain name that you owned.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Well, I just thought Einstein would be a great name to talk about artificial intelligence, and it really has been. There. You can see him behind me right on my shelf, on my bookshelf. I keep him back there. You see Einstein? I think they were [inaudible 00:39:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (39:36):
My view is blocked.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Oh, I'll go grab him.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:52):
Totally. Okay. Let's check it out.

Marc Benioff (39:54):
There he is. Ugh.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:55):
Show and tell Segment in the podcast.

Marc Benioff (39:55):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:59):
Oh, cute.

Marc Benioff (40:00):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:00):
That's a big old Einstein.

Marc Benioff (40:02):
That's a key part of our vision for Salesforce, our Einstein platform was everything we're doing. We wouldn't get to Agentforce without getting to good old Einstein here.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:12):
Very cute. As you talk about all this, I imagine many people are thinking, "Oh shit, we're not going to have as many people working. What are we going to do with our jobs? AI as agents." I know anything you say could be taken way out of context and just like, "Marc Benioff says everyone is not working," but I guess just... I know you've said you're not going to be hiring as many engineers next year. I guess anything there to help people understand how the workforce will change in the future?

Marc Benioff (40:35):
Well, I can tell you about my own company and what I'm telling my own employees, which is that, yeah, we're going to have to rebalance some of our workforce because you can see it in the numbers I just gave you which is we need less support engineers because we have a robotic support layer with Agentforce. So that is very real, and we all need to adapt. At the same time, I'm hiring a lot more account executives and folks to grow the company. So I just encouraged everybody on the all-hands call to think about that.

(41:06):
Then, I just gave you the idea of healthcare. The interesting thing about healthcare though is that a lot of the jobs that I think that are going to get created just... we don't have people for, and I think there's a lot of things that we need help with in the world that we don't have people for. So I think a lot of these jobs will not necessarily get replaced, and I think that... I have a home in a small town, and in this small town... It's very much a blue-collar town. Folks are still working in the restaurants, driving trucks, working in the supermarket, and working on their homes, building, construction, gardening.

(41:56):
Look, it's going to be a long time before, I think, jobs in the small town where I have a home will ever get impacted. But in the large town where I have a home, San Francisco, well, then I just gave you an example where I think that jobs will get impacted. So it'll be a tale of two cities, literally, and I think you will see different impacts in different places.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:21):
So what I'm hearing there is support people trending down, account executive sales trending up?

Marc Benioff (42:27):
Right now, that is Salesforce in a nutshell.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:31):
That touches on something I wanted to touch on also which is that you're... A lot of founders today are very product-minded, very product-oriented founders, and they want to build product-first companies, grow product-led, all these things. Salesforce, I think, very publicly, is very sales-led, very marketing-led, not product-led. Obviously, product is a core part of it, and it all works together, and all these things. But I guess just any advice for founders that are very product-oriented and maybe are hesitant to lean into sales, into cust-

Marc Benioff (42:57):
Yeah. I would say we're not sales-led. Well, I think let's just use Agentforce as an example, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (43:01):
Mm.

Marc Benioff (43:01):
So we're running the year, we're running this year. This is our fiscal year 25. Okay? It ends in the end of January next year. Lenny, this is the year of data cloud. This was not supposed to be the year of Agentforce. So it's the year of data cloud. I just gave you the pitch. We've automated all the customer touch points. Now, we're adding the data cloud to all of our customer implementations. We have 135,000 customers. We've implemented data cloud into all of them. They all need to turn it on. Our teams need to show our customers how to build data cloud and how it's going to help our customers have a better data structure. I almost combined "beta" and "data" together. So they need a better data structure, data architectures, data cultures.

(43:51):
Then, we had our breakthrough, and I can tell you the story where all of a sudden, I'm like, "Wow, this agent technology is happening much faster than I thought it was going to, and we are going to market now." By the time we get to Dreamforce, we are going to take this incredible technology. We accelerated it radically because we bought this company called Airkit, which is one of our Ohana... It's a great story.

(44:18):
Great entrepreneur have this company, fantastic company called RelateIQ that we bought many years ago, about 10 years ago, stayed with us for many years, like six or seven years, wanted to leave, and we said, "Great." We gave them the investment to leave, invested in the company through Salesforce Ventures, built this amazing platform, and then we said, "Now, we want to buy it back." Then, he came back about a year ago, and then it just accelerated the agent vision, and then we delivered Agentforce production code at the end of October. So, all of a sudden, now, we are releasing this product.

(44:56):
I think it's very important, if you're an entrepreneur, to realize it's not just about the product. It's not just about sales. It's not just about marketing. It's not just about accounting. It's not just about your investors. It's not just about your employees. It's not just about your stakeholders. It's about everything, so you better be ready to be an orchestra leader. You can't just be playing the clarinet.

(45:20):
I think that's what you're getting to, which is that there's entrepreneurs who are like, "I'm just going to play the clarinet." For those, I don't think they're going to go as far as they could go. You want to be playing the whole symphony, and you want to get everyone running. That symphony is sales, service, marketing, product. Every part of your shareholders, your stakeholders, your customers. You have to be constantly playing the whole symphony, and you have to have a big mind to think about, "Whoa, I have a lot of stakeholders in my company, not just one stakeholder." It's not just about product and technology. If you're going to narrowcast yourself, you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everybody else as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (46:02):
Speaking of big mind and beginner's mind, we have a recurring segment on this podcast that I call Fail Corner. Where it comes from is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of, "Everything is going great. We're killing it. I've had all these successes," and people get discouraged because they hear just people only succeeding when they often fail. So I try to ask guests to share a story, and let me ask you this. Is there a story you could share when it was a big struggle for you when you're struggling when something went super wrong that you worked through and learned something from?

Marc Benioff (46:35):
Sure. Well, I'll just give this example. About two years ago, we went through this huge transformation in our company, and there were a lot of crazy things that were happening, but it was a little bit like we're all on this Airplane, and everything is going really well. Then, something seems to be going really wrong, and we look up front, and the two pilots seemed to be missing. Then, the one guy with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and then we're all like, "Whoa, what are we going to do?" We had to do some really crazy and somewhat destructive things at the moment to basically get the regeneration of the company.

(47:12):
One of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company, and I didn't want to do it. I mean, it's the last thing I want to do as an entrepreneur, which is to adjust our headcount, but we were coming out of the pandemic, and we had just hired too many people.

(47:33):
Now, it turned out that a lot of companies in Silicon Valley all did that same maneuver during the pandemic. Things were so robust in the pandemic that we were overhiring. By the time the pandemic was over, we had too many people. I mean, what did I know? It was my first pandemic. All of a sudden, my next pandemic, I'll know that there's an economic cycle associated with it and an inflation cycle too.

(47:58):
So I learned a lot in the pandemic, and now, we're here. Now, all of a sudden, we're architecting two years ago this layoff. Then, when we did the layoff, then I'm trying to overcommunicate. I'm having all employee meetings. It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me. It's like, "Oh, boy." If I had a thick skin, it got a lot thicker during that moment because it's never going to go well no matter what, and it didn't go well but we got through it to the point where you're giving me these accolades, wonderful, on this podcast about where we are today financially and from a structural standpoint or now from product innovation standpoint, but that's not where we were two years ago.

(48:51):
It was clear we had to go through a financial transformation, which included an adjustment of our head count, and we had to go through a technology, and a product, and an innovation transformation. Those two things were going to require us to do a number of things, and they were going to be painful. So we all had to go through some of that pain to get the gain that we have now, and that was not easy.

(49:17):
I was in shock that I was going through this two years ago because I had already been running the company for 23 years. Things were going pretty well. Yes, there were a lot of failures during that period. I just didn't expect another massive issue to hit me. But guess what? There're constantly massive issues coming at you, and there's more coming, and that's the nature.

(49:39):
My friend, Michael Bell, is probably the best entrepreneur I know. He says, "There is no linear success." So what that means is that stock chart that you just referred to, there's no up-and-to-the-right perfect chart where it's just one line. I don't care who you are. Apple doesn't have one. No one has one. Okay? There's going to be changes. It could be economic changes. It could be societal changes. It could be the pandemic. There's no up-and-to-the-right. If you think it's only going to be about up and to the right, you're in the wrong business or you have the wrong life. Right? Hey, the monastic life is maybe more for you where you're just out living in that more of that steady state. Right? But if you want more variation where it's not steady state, the entrepreneurial life is a rock-and-roll roller coaster, and you get ready because it's going to be pounding you all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (50:33):
One of these people that you described that jumped out of the airplane speaking on the roller coaster ride is your co-CEO, Bret Taylor. What's interesting to me is he's also all-in on agents, and what it makes me think about is there's this meme of what did Ilya see when he left and tried to kick out Sam Altman. I'm curious just like what did you guys see about agents being the future that you're both so committed to this? So interesting.

Marc Benioff (50:54):
Well, I just think that this idea that agents are one of the most important things that we're all going to work on, and I think everyone is going to go to agents. Look, I just heard about Google today has Agentspace. At first, I was like, "Well, I guess they like the Agentforce name." I love Sundar. He's one of my favorite people in the world. We heard Microsoft now has agents. I read Oracle has agents now. SAP has agents. Everybody's got agents, and good. That's what we want. We don't want to be the only one.

(51:30):
If you're the only one and no one else is working on it, you've got a problem, actually. So you don't want to be the only one. You want to be in a market. You don't want to be one company offering a solution and the only one. You want to be in a competitive market where people are competing with you, and you're selling against somebody else, and you're getting better, and you're moving forward. It's like the automobile industry. One of my favorite people is Akio Toyoda. Toyoda-san was now the Chairman of Toyota, was the CEO of Toyota. His grandfather started Toyota. He says, "Better, better, better. Never best." It's the Japanese motto of Kaizen.

(52:10):
So we talked about Japanese Shoshin, which means beginner's mind. Now, we're learning another Japanese word here, Kaizen. Kaizen is continuous improvement, and you need to be doing continuous improvement. With where we are right now with agents, every software industry is going to move to agents. We have to just like every software industry... Well, at least in CRM or automating customer touchpoints, data and managing data, and building that data infrastructure, agents. It's all related. We're all moving in the same direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (52:47):
I'm just thinking as a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (52:54):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. That is the mindset you want. You want that mindset. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing." In some ways, you have to be saying, "I can't wait for the next failure. I can't wait for the next success. I can't wait for the next innovation." Oh, well, that's innovation overall, right?

(53:18):
See, we're in an industry where technology is constantly getting lower cost, easier to use, and more automated. So if you're doing for two and a half decades, or four decades, or four and a half decades now that I've been doing it... When I started in this industry, I started on a computer called the TRS-80 Model I with 4K of RAM. I was doing a podcast recently, and they're like, "Well, who did you sell your first piece of software to?" I said, "Well, I sold it to CLOAD Magazine in Goleta, California and-

Lenny Rachitsky (53:54):
For $75.

Marc Benioff (53:54):
For $75, and they said, "Thank you for..." and then they said, "Oh, that's great, and did you send them the disk?" I'm like, "No, no. There was no disk. CLOAD standard for Cassette Load in BASIC. That was the command in BASIC, C-L-O-A-D, Cassette Load, CLOAD. That was the command. So that was the name of their magazine, and then you would get the cassette every month with five or six things that they had bought from people like me." I mean, they didn't know they were buying it from a 15-year-old kid in high school in Burlingame High School California. But I had written the How to Juggle thing, and they bought it for $75. They sent me the one-page agreement, and I signed it. Then, I told my parents, and they're like, "What? Huh? You're doing what? Oh, okay. That's nice, honey. Great job."

(54:45):
So they didn't understand. Nobody knew. It was crazy. It was like 1979 or 1978, so nobody knew I was selling software. I was in high school. It was just a moment in time, but I need to have that mindset all the way along which is, "What is the next great thing? What is the next great success? What is the next great failure?" You're growing. You're evolving. You're learning from that. That's what you want. You want to have that growth mindset. Right? You want to embrace that. Does it make sense what I said?

Lenny Rachitsky (55:21):
Absolutely.

Marc Benioff (55:22):
I jumped on that one little thought. "Oh, gee, yeah. I've got this now under control, but now I've got agents, so now, what am I going to..." It's like, "No, that's what you want." By the way, I want what's after that too, and what's after that, and what's after that. That's what's really exciting about the future. It's coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (55:43):
Why?

Marc Benioff (55:43):
I want to be... One of our customers said this, and people think I said it. It wasn't me. I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there. That's what I think is... By the way, that's what I think Elon Musk does so well. He is like... I don't know all the crazy things he's doing to see the future. He's clearly doing some unusual things, but then he's like, "Yeah, we're going to have robots in the future, and brain machine interfaces, and driving electric cars. All of these things are going to be happening in the future, and I'm going to have 10 companies that are going to do all of them." Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:23):
He's not only thinking about it, he's doing them each.

Marc Benioff (56:26):
Amazing,

Lenny Rachitsky (56:27):
Amazing.

Marc Benioff (56:27):
No one like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:29):
Yeah.

Marc Benioff (56:29):
Never seen anything like it. I don't understand how it is even possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:34):
Same. Marc, I know you have to run. This was incredible. I think this is a beautiful place to end it.

Marc Benioff (56:40):
Oh, Lenny, you're so much fun. I've been looking forward to being on your podcast and talk about entrepreneurship, and thanks for everything you're doing for the industry and for entrepreneurs everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:49):
Same, Marc Benioff.

Marc Benioff (56:50):
We're all so grateful to you. Goodbye now, and welcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:53):
I feel the same. Thank you. Bye. Bye, everyone.

# AI and product management | Marily Nika (Meta, Google)

## Transcript

Marily Nika (00:00):
There is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI." Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high-level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it.

Lenny (00:28):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Marily Nika. Marily teaches the most popular course on Maven on AI and product management. She's currently product lead at Meta focusing on Metaverse, avatars and identity. Prior to Meta, she was at Google for over eight years working on Google Glass, computer vision and machine learning around speech recognition. In our conversation, we touch on what PMs should be paying attention to when it comes to what's happening in AI. We talk about a bunch of resources that'll help you get started in the world of AI. How AI tools available today can already help you do your job better as a PM.

(01:12):
We also get relatively technical into what exactly is a model, how are models trained, all kinds of fun stuff like that. Enjoy this conversation with Marily Nika after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Lenny (01:53):
This episode is brought to you by EPPO. EPPO is a next-generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on EPPO to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth in stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPPO does all that and more, delivering results quickly and avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(02:41):
EPO lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPPO supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out EPPO at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(03:06):
Marilee, welcome to the podcast.

Marily Nika (03:08):
Thank you. Hello, thank you for having me.

Lenny (03:10):
It's very much my pleasure. We've interacted a little bit on Twitter. We've never actually talked before just right now. I've seen your course just all over the place, your course on AI and PM. And so I just thought it'd be really fun to have you on and help us all understand what the hell is happening in AI and especially AI and product. So thanks again for being here.

Marily Nika (03:33):
Yes, thank you. I'm really excited.

Lenny (03:36):
I would love your help as a former full-time PM/everyone listening that is a current PM, to help us understand what is going on with AI and product tech in general and tools in general. Move really fast, if you're trying to pay attention to what's happening, it's really hard to stay up to date on where things are going and it feels especially hard in AI.

(03:57):
It feels like there's just something coming out every day. And so I have a bunch of questions along these lines. The first is just like what media do you pay attention to stay on top of what's happening and what's new and what's interesting in the world of AI and machine learning?

Marily Nika (04:11):
As you know very well, subscribing to newsletters is something that's really impactful. And of course, I subscribe to your newsletter, but I am a big, big, big fan of the download by MIT Ecology Review or Atelier. And they're not necessarily AI-centric, but what I'm advocating for and what I'm telling people is that in the future everything will be AI by default. So even if you have something that's technology focused, you'll see a lot of AI starting to get sprinkled in there.

Lenny (04:40):
I want to follow up on what you just said there, but maybe we'll save it a little bit. Maybe going in a different direction first, what do you think is overhyped in the space of AI right now? What do you think is under hyped and undervalued?

Marily Nika (04:52):
I would like to discuss strategy between, which is both under hyped and over hyped at the same time. I was reading this article this morning where there are writers complaining and they're very, very fearful and they think, "Oh, writing online is going to die. Everything we've studying for is going to be replaced. They're going to take our jobs and so on." And I'm just like, "No, no, no. Charging PT and technology is enhancing our work. It's enhancing us. It does not steal from us." So that's what comes across right now. And there are other things that are under hype, but obviously ChatGPT is amazing. I'm using it day to day, but there are other things AI can do in an amazing manner.

(05:34):
I was reading a research article the other day that said that AI can now detect place. So lie detection, whether I is for security reasons or at work or anything like that is now possible. So I encourage people to go to these newsletters and go to these online blogs, 10 prints and so on, and just read what's happening. It's not all about chat reading, there's more, there's more about AI, but you should read a lot.

Lenny (05:58):
You mentioned that you use ChatGPT in your work life. Talk about that. What are you actually using it for?

Marily Nika (06:04):
Even when I'm at work and I am trying to come up with a nice mission statement, when we're PMs will come up with mission statements, it's just crucial part and it's where the core begins. You want to get people excited, you want to get people inspired. There is nothing I can write that's going to be as good as what ChatGPT looks like. So what I do is I literally go to ChatGPT and I say rewrite this mission statement from me and even the first try produces something which is fantastic, so that.

(06:34):
Number two, it helps me create user segments in a fantastic way. It will think of user segments that your mind wouldn't even go there, it just wouldn't go there. And it will provide the motivations, it will provide the pinpoints and you just come up with ideas as you read it. And then the last thing that it does is it provides ideas for you whether AI enhanced. So I just use a day-to-day, even [inaudible 00:07:00] day-to-day workflow, but I'm not making it do my job for me, I'm asking it after I have already had a mission in my head and what it is I want to do.

Lenny (07:10):
So is the way you're approaching it is you just put in, come up with a better mission statement then and then you give it your version of the mission statement?

Marily Nika (07:18):
Exactly.

Lenny (07:19):
Interesting. And you're saying that that comes up with a better mission statement than the one you had?

Marily Nika (07:25):
It's better because the mission statement is going to be read by all disciplines. It's not just going to be read by PMs that already have a lot of context and understand. It's going to be read by leadership, by junior people, by stakeholders, by other departments, by competitors. And you needed to be on Orient ending the words that are meant to be understood by everyone. Even a kid could understand and they would get inspired by you as well.

Lenny (07:49):
And then you also said he use it for personas. How do you actually frame that prompt with ChatGPT?

Marily Nika (07:55):
Let's say you're working for a specific product area and you know want to create some fitness band, so you would say something like, who would be interested in the fitness band that doesn't have a screen? And it will provide a bulleted list all of people like, hey, young professionals are that they're interested but don't have enough time. People that do not want to charge their wearables every day. Then the list goes on. It's just fantastic.

Lenny (08:24):
You were talking about how you think the future of AI is, it's the default and is what you mean there that it's basically baked into every product we use and it helps the user do better things, it helps the product work better. Is that what you mean or is it something else?

Marily Nika (08:39):
I believe that ballpark managers will be AI product managers in the future. And this is because we see all products needing to have a personalized experience, a recommender system that is actually good. I mean you cannot watch to Netflix, you cannot even watch a movie without needing that. After you watch White Lotus or Stranger Things, you will want something similar to watch. You're not going to want a romantic thing to be suggested or recommended to you.

(09:06):
Also, automation is another thing. We need to keep improving on society. We need to keep making technological advancements. You're not going to be able to do that if you don't have an AI centric view in every sector that you're working on.

Lenny (09:20):
When you say that every PM will be an AI PM is your thinking that you'll be using AI tools in your job as a PM or that you'll be building AI into everything you're building with? How do you think about that?

Marily Nika (09:35):
I think it's that you will need to get comfortable with having a partner that's a research scientist and you will need to understand that these people can produce a smart model. They'll be able to do some automation, some personalization, some recommendations on. In a lot of people, truly uncomfortable, a lot of people don't know how to approach the researchers. A lot of people don't like the uncertainty that research has. A lot of PMs are very, very used to, "Okay, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch." Whereas when you're working with research, it's more like we're going to try this and then in a year if it doesn't work out we're going to shut the written down and repeated completing [inaudible 00:10:17]. So I feel that if people get more used to uncertainty and research, things are going to be good in the end for them.

Lenny (10:28):
I thought you were comparing ChatGPT as a researcher you're working with, but you're actually saying people will have PhD researchers on their teams helping them build models into their product to make their product better. Is that what you're saying?

Marily Nika (10:43):
Correct. This is exactly what I'm-

Lenny (10:45):
Interesting.

Marily Nika (10:47):
And from a product perspective I can imagine like three bubbles in my head. So you want to find the intersection both something that's desirable by users, something that is going to be a viable business and something that is going to be feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective. And then when you have that, it's just going to be a capacity product for desktop launch that you can run with. So yeah, whenever I say researcher, research scientist that can produce an AI machine learning model.

Lenny (11:15):
Wow. Didn't think about how every cross-functional team might end up with a research scientist. Interesting, interesting. For PMs who are curious about learning how to do this stuff, what are a couple things that PMs today who have no experience with AI, what can they do to start learning how to build AI tooling into their products, understand what the hell's happening in the space of AI?

Marily Nika (11:40):
This is a good question and I guess the message I want to pass is you shouldn't be overwhelmed by these technologies if you don't have a technical background because you can learn these things and as a PM you'll never need to actually train or code. Also, even if you want to train, there are no code approaches for training models. But to answer the question, if you're working on any product, you can always sprinkle in a smarter feature. So you can make it more secure, you can personalize it, you can enhance it with fraud detection, you can make it more ethical. If it's healthcare, you can make it faster, you can make it more accurate. If it's shopping, you can create better accommodations. Basically anything where you can get data behind the behavior with users can be improved with AI.

(12:30):
So I guess it's all about changing the mindset of PMs. Taking a step back and just thinking about, okay, I have all this data that's just lying and sitting around what is it that I can do with it? I've been meeting PMs that said, "Oh, we're not collecting any data, we're [inaudible 00:12:46] dashboard." So even that is a huge first step towards AI. And then just start thinking about it, where you could deal, get a data science intern and just see what they are going to do. There's just so much people can do.

Lenny (13:00):
So say you want to start investing in some sort of model, some sort of AI within your team, you're saying maybe hire data scientists who can help you start to build something that you can start integrating. Is that your advice on the first step of once you start, you want to start getting serious about building some sort of AI component.

Marily Nika (13:19):
There is something called the shiny object trap and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI". Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it. And there's a definition I like giving. I usually say that the generalist PM helps their team and their company build and ship the right product. But the AI PM helps their team or company solve the right problem. So if you want to get into AI PM figure out what the problem is that you will get a data scientist to create a model for solving, but there needs to be a problem, there needs to be audience, there needs to be a user and a pin going for it.

Lenny (14:11):
What are signs that AI may not be a good approach to solving a problem? You said that, and this happened on a lot of my teams, oh we're going to build a really cool model, it's going to do something really smart in this case and it often ended up being a very low ROI investment and took six months to a year before you even knew what the hell what was happening. Do you have any thoughts on signs that maybe this isn't a place you should be putting a lot of time into AI versus this is definitely an opportunity. Yes, we should do this, invest a lot of time into this.

Marily Nika (14:42):
Don't do it for your MVP. It makes zero sense. Do not waste time of data scientists that can train models with using powerful machines that are going take weeks to train. This is because if you have an MVP and you just want to get buy-in for an idea or feature that may use AI in the future, take it, create a little figma prototype and just show it some users, just fake what the AI is going to be doing. So a lot of young early stage entrepreneurs reach out to me and they say, "Oh, should train this model to do this and that because we want to prove that there is a market." "No, do not use AI. You should use AI where you think you already have some data or data from an adjacent product that you feel you can leverage for your own product to create something that's meaningful, recommendation automation, what we talking about. But not for an MVP. Please people, this is my advice.

Lenny (15:46):
How much data do you think you need for AI ML to have a chance to contribute? You have a heuristic of if you have anything less than this, it's not going to work at all.

Marily Nika (15:59):
This is a good question and it honestly depends on what I'm what I'm trying to do. If you're trying to classify, if the photo is a category dog, obviously even if you have, I don't know like 15, 20 labeled photos, what's going to work. But if you want to create voice recognizers or complicated NLP applications, you're going to need thousands of [inaudible 00:16:19] of data. And this what's making this not be easy? AI systems are not easy to develop. There is a life cycle of a machine learning project and after scoping you need to figure out, "Oh god, how much data do we need? Where do I find this data as well, how much data?" Sometimes I've seen people synthesizing their own fake data just so that they can have something to train with and test their models. But the exact amount is hard to be defined, especially from a [inaudible 00:16:50]. I'm sure data scientists have a different opinion.

Lenny (16:53):
Yeah, my guess is most startups are going to have nowhere near enough data to build their own model and make it something really interesting. So do you have a thought on when it makes sense to try to build your own model, try to train your own GPT type thing versus use something that's already out there like say GPT or aJourney or all those guys.

Marily Nika (17:17):
If you are a big tech company and you're offering a service that is going to do speech or permission or then it's going to have their own tragedy, you want to use more data and more diverse data to train and retain and train because if you don't then your quality is going to be the same as every other companies. There are agencies that are selling data, packages of data, that are ready so you can get them and train your models. But the question is if everyone takes that exact dataset, then the quality that every single company is producing is going to be the exact same. So you do want to diversify, you do want to collect your own data. And I guess a good question from my prem perspective is when is the quality of your product good enough to lunch?

(18:08):
And that is a really interesting point because it's totally your responsibility as a PM to decide, "Okay, the recognition of whether this folder is a category dog is good enough for the users, it's like 70% accurate, 80% accurate, where is the bar, where do we launch?" And that's why I'm like the AI PM role is so cool because you have problems like that to solve that no one else was tackled before. So it's all on you.

Lenny (18:34):
We've thrown out these words model and we talk about training models. Do you have a good succinct explanation for what a model is for folks that aren't that technical and then just the general idea of training a model. What is a simple way to think of, here is what a model is.

Marily Nika (18:52):
So I have a three-year-old girl and I'm teaching hear about life and everything. So I was recently teaching her about the animals and you explain things to her once or twice, what the mammals is or rhino and so on. But you will end up training your kids brain by repeating the same information again. So you will say, "Hey, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like." And once you've done this enough times, then your kid will see an animal on the street and they'll be able to recognize and say, "Oh yeah, that's like rhino what we're talking about." This is exactly what a model is. The model is like a kid's brain. It has the ability to take an input, which means it has the ability to take an image and say, "Oh I recognize what this is. That looks like a rhino. But I'm 70% sure about this." So you will output the probability as well of the certainty.

Lenny (19:51):
And you said image, but it could be text for say in ChatGPT. In the future I imagine video there's also voice like whisper. That's an awesome explanation. Basically it's like trying to recreate the human brain is a nice way of thinking about it. And then training a model, can you talk about what that means?

Marily Nika (20:08):
The problems of training the model for example is providing a lot of images that are legal and say, "Hey, here's what card looks like, here's what it all looks like," and we're talking about thousands and thousands of data sets for this. And once you do this, there's a process where the model is just processing this information and it's learning, it's finding patterns through it and the patterns are not in the form of, oh if this is gray then this means this. No, it just learns in the smart brain how to identify specific things that we don't even understand. And then it's able to output the probability of whether photo is going to contain the cutter and top.

Lenny (20:49):
Just conceptually what is the output of the training? Is it code that is auto-generated with these decision trees and weights and things like that? Is it a database of weight? Just conceptually what is the output of a training that becomes a model? What's the simplest way to think about that?

Marily Nika (21:05):
So it's what it speaks. Speech is a great example. For example, I'm talking to a device which is like a home system and I say, "Hey, what is the weather like today?" This is going to take my folies and audio and it's going to process it and the output is going to be a transcription. So it's literally going to be text that corresponds to what I sent to it.

Lenny (21:24):
Thinking about the stuff you've worked on at Google, at Meta, anywhere else you've worked on, side projects even, what are some of the cooler applications of AI machine learning that you've worked on, contributed to, or even seen that you can talk about? I imagine there's a lot of sensitive stuff too going on.

Marily Nika (21:40):
One thing I want to talk about is the team I used to work for, Google, which was then the RVR team and they were working on an air glass and actually they had a video on last year's Google IO. They were able to have the Google glass on someone that spoke one language and then this other person was sat in front of them that spoke a different language and the glass will take as an input that audio that came from that other person and it will transcribe it, it will translate it and show it on the screen for that person in their language. So we're talking about the ability for this devices to unlock the borders of communication and that is not science fiction. This is what amazing and mind-blowing, there's no science fiction anymore. These things are real, the technology is here, it's just a matter of connecting the pieces to the puzzle in order to see them coming to life. So I think that one was one of the most impactful things I've ever seen.

Lenny (22:46):
I remember that demo and it was pretty incredible. Okay, so thinking a little more broadly, do you think ChatGPT or just say GPT four or GPT five, GPT six, do you think at some point this will replace product managers? Something I see on Twitter a lot. People are like, "Oh my god, product managements done. This thing made my product requirements document for me." Or you talked about how it makes your mission statement better. Do you think there's a place where PMs aren't necessary anymore?

Marily Nika (23:13):
Oh, absolutely not. As I said, it makes everything better. If anything it's going to free out time for me to do other things that are less tedious. For example, I am running so many projects and they only their peer [inaudible 00:23:27] and the peer [inaudible 00:23:28] have all these areas that are common across all of them. If I had a system that can actually write the continuous stuff for me so that I can focus on more strategic side of things, that would be incredible. It will make us smarter. If [inaudible 00:23:42], you will unlock new areas of product management that we haven't realized that, but are there.

Lenny (23:48):
Are there areas, do you think with your kind of vision of all PMs will be AI PMs, are there areas that you think PMs should invest more skill-wise or areas they should less focus on invest because say some machine learning model is going to do that for them.

Marily Nika (24:04):
I'd like to see people being less overwhelmed, less intimidated, less afraid to start learning how to code, how to train a little model on their own. This is because even if ChatGPT or this no code applications may be able to do this for us, it gives you a different approach, a different mindset, a different if you want confidence to know how things work. And here's a silly example, I was learning how to play the piano when I was young and when my teacher came in I was like, "Oh, I want to learn how to play this cool song." There were some songs that I really liked. And she said, "No, you need to start with a classical music," and I just hated it all the time. And I said, "Why do I have to do this?" Because she said, "If you learn the fundamentals and how you know where things started and the beginning of music, it's going to help you along the way to create music on your own if you want to." And she was right. I just loved it.

(25:00):
So it's the same with coding. I encourage people to just take an online course, understand more, get your hands dirty, pair up with someone else that's in the same boat as you because this is going to give you the skillset to understand how that tool that's going to help you in your day-to-day was even created in the first place instead of blindfoldedly distrusted to do your job.

Lenny (25:23):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, bias and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management including a continuous employee-centric approach. So employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

(26:21):
For someone that actually wants to do that and learn to code, which I love that advice, do you have any resources, places that you point people to for learning to code, getting started down that path?

Marily Nika (26:31):
It depends on what type of learner you are. There are some people that learn offline, so just go to Coursera, there are so many courses. There is an amazing one actually introduction to AI by Stanford that they're going to encourage people to take a look at. But I know that a lot of people don't like, don't have the time, don't have the discipline to actually take time off or after work, after they put their kids to sleep to just do it. So if you enjoy learning with others, if you enjoying being part of a team, if you enjoy going through a journey together, then I recommend these resources. So there is something called Career Foundry, which is a fantastic on coding school, General Assembly and then Coding Dojo.

(27:13):
I was actually give a talk, Ages of God Coding Dojo [inaudible 00:27:17] by Python, and all it takes is just a few weeks of your time and passion and just for you to roll up your sleeves and just realize that this is not intimidating and realize the benefits you can get by learning.

Lenny (27:31):
Awesome, thanks for sharing those. We'll include links in the show notes. Going back to a PM trying to become better in AI. If you think about a PM that's early in their career and wants to become a very strong AI PM. I know you have a whole course about this, which we can talk about now or later, whatever is easier, what should that PM be doing? We talked a bit about learn to code, maybe start playing with tools. What else do you suggest PMs that want to become really strong AI PMs do now and invest in?

Marily Nika (28:02):
So I do have a course that's coming up on February 6th on [inaudible 00:28:06], which is for current and aspiring product managers that want to build AI products. But I also have offline recordings. I have the same course on an offline basis on my website. I'd be happy to talk to you here, you already chat to me about this. What I feel people should understand is what it takes to manage an AI product. Of course people are very familiar with the stages of product development in general, but AI product development is different. As I mentioned before, sometimes you're actually managing the problem and not the product and you're trying to secure out if there is a problem that makes sense to be answered by a smart solution.

(28:45):
So it's a very interesting and more complicated process than regular product management. So number one, figure out how it differs from general product management. Number two, if you're already at the company that is actually having AR researchers and AI research scientists, I encourage people to just maybe talk to them and shadow them and spend an hour of their week just talking to them and experiencing what they're doing. This is going to open your mind, this is going to give you so much context as to what it is and the endless potential that you can identify there.

Lenny (29:22):
Awesome. And is there anything else you want to share from your course that you think might be interesting to folks?

Marily Nika (29:30):
So we talked about why it's awesome to be an AI PM, but I do want to call out that there are a few challenges that people need to be aware of. Number one, and I kind of mentioned it before, is the uncertainty. You may have been working on all of these incredible research and ideas in hypothesis, but then when you actually train the model, the results you may be getting may not be optimal, may not be answering the questions or the hypothesis that you actually had in mind. So that's number one. You need to be able to encourage the teams throughout this process because you're like the captain of the ship, you need to be the one that's cheerleading the team, making sure everyone keeps going.

(30:10):
Number two, you are going to have to [inaudible 00:30:15]. You are going to have to change the action in managing this from a leadership perspective can be tricky and it can be challenging.

(30:22):
Number three, we talked about data, but getting good data is hard. You may need to be creative, figure out ways for data collection that you never thought you'll do. You may get on the street and ask for people to actually contribute data for what it is you're doing. You need to be able to and willing to do everything. And the last thing is from a career trajectory, usually product managers get ahead the more they launch. But if you're in a research or if you're not going to launch as often, so you need to make sure to clarify with the hiring managers early on, "Hey, what does progress mean? How am I going to get a sense in a research work which is different than what I've been doing so far." So it's challenging but I always encourage people to flex different muscles and this is the zero to one muscle. The other thing is this crucial when it comes to product management.

Lenny (31:15):
This actually is a great segue to a question I definitely wanted to ask, which is around getting buy-in for investment at a company for ML. So there's sometimes all this energy for a zero to one, let's just try something, sometimes not, so maybe there's a two part question here. Do you have any advice on just getting buy-in for we want to try something with ML. It's going to take us six months to figure out if it's worth the effort, but we think there's something here. And then sometimes there's a lot of energy initially and then you get some win, like your search ranking's smarter and it's great.

(31:48):
But then maintaining that, having all these really expensive people working and just tweaking this model and continuing to make it smarter and a little more efficient, often it's hard to continue to get buy-in for that sort of team. Do you have any advice on initial buy-in, let's try something here, and then down the road just keeping a team going, trying to make this thing smarter and smarter.

Marily Nika (32:09):
People should know that there is an excellent source of inspiration and something that could kind of de-risk things, which is adjacent products. Maybe the company has already launched the product that has been successful, those AI firsts. And whenever I try to convince leadership about something that I want to do that's a big bet, I always use examples and I'm like, "Hey, this seemed crazy at the time, here's how they work. What I'm proposing is very similar to this crazy thing. And then I propose a little contingency plan, like hey, if that doesn't work out, here's the rollback plan, here's the maximum impact it will have done in a negative way, which is not going to be too much. And you kind of take it all on [inaudible 00:32:55].

(32:55):
And it's interesting because the more you work on this specific company, the more trust you get. And if the culture is such, then failing is going to be welcome. So a lot companies that welcome pain because you can just go ahead and do this sort of thing.

Lenny (33:09):
Do tell me if I'm wrong, but I feel like most investments in ML are not successes and often not great uses of time. I'm curious if that changes with more tooling and more public models that people can plug into without having to build their own. I wonder if it becomes like, "Oh okay look we're put in three weeks, we'll get something really useful."

Marily Nika (33:27):
Exactly. And also the other thing, and I wanted to add on the question you asked before about hey how do you keep updated about new niche tech? We shouldn't underestimate academia and research blogs and there's a website called Archive where you can see new papers come up, because this is where... ChatGPT and [inaudible 00:33:49] used to be there for a long time, there was a lot of information on this sort thing. But it's now recent where we see that research scientists and research orgs are not as siloed as they used to be. So the more companies invest on staffing, this layer between productionizing and research, academic research, the more PMs you're going to add there, then the more you're going to see this bridge creating goods, products, [inaudible 00:34:20]. So sometimes you have amazing ideas by research scientists but you need a PM to take it and actually figure out ways to also monetize it.

(34:28):
That's the other thing, if you're a PM you need to come up with ways to actually be able to monetize and ChatGPT is now free for everyone. But I don't know if you saw, there was a signup forum that was coming around saying, "Hey, would you pay for this? What would be the minimum you pay? What would the maximum you pay? What would you like to see if you paid?" So having PMs breached the tap is crucial for companies to be able to take the research and actually come up with meaningful use cases for users.

Lenny (34:56):
I think they actually started charging the other day. I think it's like $40, $42 a month to start using it. I think people have been talking about on Twitter, I don't know if that's live yet. And then you talked about research papers, when I think that, I always think of Tyler Cohen, he has this awesome blog marginal revolution and he is really good at sharing insights from research papers that he's reading. So that's another place for folks to check out. He's just this really smart dude. He's really excited about AI and GPT in general and so he shares a lot of really interesting insights about it all. Segueing a little bit to your course, I have a couple questions about it. One is can you just talk about the broad framework of your course? How long is it, what do you learn, what are the workshops broadly? And then I have a couple follow up questions.

Marily Nika (35:39):
My course is three week long. It's meant for people that are either aspiring or current PMs that want to understand how to sprinkle in AI solutions or they wanted a full-time AI course. Week one is more about introduction, what the product development lifecycle is for regular products and how it differs for AIPN specifically. And then we talk about idea creation. How on earth do you come up with ideas? And I love what Steve Job said where he used to say, "Well, users don't know what they want until you show it to them." And that's exactly the mindset I want to invite two people and say, "Hey, people don't know how on earth you use AI." People will never have imagined ChatGPT can be what it is.

(36:26):
And then we take that and we dive deep and we talk about how on the earth do you productionize something like this? What are the different partners you're working with? What is a research scientist and how on the earth do you collaborate and how do you partner with them? How do you convince them what you have in mind for their precious research to be converted into a product? How on earth do you convince them to trust you and how do you influence them? And then at the end we're talking about how you actually will be able to pave your pathway PM all the way from interviewing for this role, from what resumes look like, and doing some mock interviews because the more you practice the better it is.

Lenny (37:03):
How many workshops are there through the course?

Marily Nika (37:05):
Nine workshops.

Lenny (37:06):
Nine workshops. Of the nine workshops, which of them are you finding is the most exciting, game-changing for someone, most interesting?

Marily Nika (37:15):
So throughout the duration of all these workshops, people have homework and they actually take home an exercise where they need to create and develop their own AI product end to end, and they can pair up with each other. By the way, there was this two students pair up and actually where I would raise funding, which is mind blowing to me, which is really great.

Lenny (37:15):
That's awesome.

Marily Nika (37:35):
But to continue, the most exciting part is when everyone at the great end are actually presenting their work and they're actually asking questions and getting feedback and they're just really excited and proud for what they created.

Lenny (37:48):
That's a good reminder of a lot of the learning that you do is just doing it, not just reading about it and following Twitter. Can you share any examples of stuff people built after the course?

Marily Nika (37:57):
Someone was able to actually, and I kid you not, create a little model that was able to take us an input x-rays that they found online and was able to tell us what was wrong if something was wrong with that patient. And it's just crazy to think that you can do that within three weeks. Obviously it was just by photos we were able to crawl online for x-rays. But the concept is there that you can build something like that, you can create it. And to take it a bit further, they wanted to create a lower recommender system and say, "Hey, we think this is what's wrong with you, here are the steps you should follow." Obviously we're not trying to play doctors or to pretend that or medical in any way, but being able to see that actually functioning is just, it's very impactful.

Lenny (38:48):
That's amazing. Do they already know how to code, do this team that built this thing?

Marily Nika (38:51):
They did not, but part of the course is to teach people the basics that you are going to need, prove it PM lens. And there are some no click tools as I mentioned that are going to allow you to drive and drop and train these models and input photos in it and be able to do it.

Lenny (39:07):
Can you mention those tools again because that is really interesting and it's just like a peek at your course, but if someone wanted to start building something like this, what are some of these tools they could check out?

Marily Nika (39:16):
One of the tools I would like to recommend to people is actually Auto ML. This is offered by World of Cloud and essentially it allows you to train high quality custom machine learning models, which minimal effort, you don't need to be able to code anything like that. You need to have a lot of photos and images that you have already corrected but it's not going to do the collection for you. And a great application I had to seen, there is actually a YouTube video about this. There was this company that actually had a lot of winter banks and what they did is in order to maintain these, they will actually have people manually have huge ladders and go take a look and see if everything was okay. So eventually they just [inaudible 00:39:59] drones and they had these drones fly on all of these machines and take photos of everything. And then they downloaded all these photos and they uploaded on Auto ML and they were able to see which ones needed maintenance and which did not.

(40:12):
And I think they reduced time from three weeks of work to a few hours of knowing which needed maintenance and just be able to send people there. So it's this type of thing that you can do on your own by applying this sort of tools.

Lenny (40:25):
Saying that tool is called Auto ML?

Marily Nika (40:28):
Yes, Auto ML.

Lenny (40:28):
Amazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Coming back to your course and maybe just a couple more questions. Can you just talk about what it takes to build a course like the course you built, how much time did it take you? How much work did it take? Anything that you want to share.

Marily Nika (40:43):
It treated creating like course like a product. This is what I did is, I came up with some hypothesis as to who the audience was and as to what they were looking to get out of it. And I started reaching out to people and I started saying, "Hey, first of all, would you like to learn from me? Second of all, what would you like to learn? What are the specific questions that you would need answered?" Because these are people that are working, people [inaudible 00:41:09] that have families. In order to take a break from all that you need to provide something to them that is meaningful. And there were quite a few activations. In the beginning I was focusing the course more for software engineers that wanted to become AI product managers. But then I realized, no, there are a lot of PMs that want to become AI product managers.

(41:31):
So I did a little online shift there. So what it takes is make sure you find the right audience, make sure to figure out what that audience wants, make sure to have the right duration. One week I find it too short. Two weeks, it'll still be rushed. Three weeks is excellent because you give the opportunity to everyone to present and to keep to know each other on an offline discord community, which is another important part. And then the last thing, you need to have a personal relationship with everyone. So I've messaged everyone, I've seen everyone's application. I met with some people as well just to make sure to answer any questions and concerns because I wanted to make sure that people were comfortable just trusting a stranger like me and paying them to provide knowledge for their course. So it took quite a few iterations, but I was able to get there and now I'm very, very happy about it and I recorded it offline as well for people.

Lenny (42:27):
Has anything had to change in this course? Maybe it's just as the last question, things are moving so fast. Is there anything you've had to rethink, redo since you first built it?

Marily Nika (42:35):
I actually added bonus sections and one bonus section was [inaudible 00:42:38] and how it was trained. This is because I started this new cohort in December and on day one the question I got is, what is this? How did it start? What is going on? How did they train it? So I added the dedicated section for it and I point people to it.

Lenny (42:52):
Amazing. Anything else that you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Marily Nika (42:58):
It was someone that recommended, I actually did a course and in the beginning I laughed and I said, "Wait, people would want to learn from me. Really?" And of course they did. And I'm teaching so many people. So what I want to tell people is don't underestimate this. Try creating your own courses as well. People may want to learn what you take for granted. For them it may be game changing, it can be life changing. So building courses is an amazing thing and we're living in the full [inaudible 00:43:30]. So the course is content, so go try this.

Lenny (43:33):
I find that teaching and at least crystallizing thoughts is one of the best ways to learn it yourself. I imagine you learned a lot about AI much more than even came into it with just putting it together into a course.

Marily Nika (43:44):
Absolutely. And I got some uncomfortable questions that I had no idea how to tackle. People on day one were like, how do I assess the tradeoffs between these two different months? And I had to figure out how to answer these things and how to incorporate them in my course. So learning from the students, learning from the course, learning from explaining is just so viable. So skills that we can get.

Lenny (44:07):
Well with that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, share. We'll see how it all goes. Sound good?

Marily Nika (44:18):
Sounds good.

Lenny (44:19):
Two or three books that you recommend most to other people.

Marily Nika (44:22):
Inspired. It's all about how to create tech products people love.

Lenny (44:28):
Marty Kagan, right?

Marily Nika (44:29):
Yes, that's the one. Great.

Lenny (44:34):
Cool. Anything else? Or that's the one that comes to mind.

Marily Nika (44:35):
You Look Like a Thing and I Love You and I have it right here. It's a great thing, super, super cool. It's about how AI works and why it's making the world a weirder place. It's actually a very fun book. And there's one more, which is a book, a workbook I originally launched with Alana Karen and it's a workbook for women in tech trying to navigate working in tech. It's called Adventures of Women in Tech Workbook. So that's another thing that they want to shamelessly plug in.

Lenny (45:02):
Ah, that's a great choice to plug. Where can folks find that? Is that on Amazon?

Marily Nika (45:06):
Yeah, Amazon.

Lenny (45:07):
Amazing. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to?

Marily Nika (45:11):
I like Boz's podcast. I don't know if you're aware of it. Boz is the CEO of Facebook. He has a great podcast.

Lenny (45:19):
I have not heard it. I do know of Boz. I'll check that out. I didn't know he had a podcast. He had some great writing over the years. Maybe that's why he doesn't write it anymore. He has his podcast. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've loved?

Marily Nika (45:30):
Oh my God, The White Lotus. People were talking about this thing. I ended up just trying it out and me and my husband, we just binge watched the whole thing. Is just so different, so mind blowing, get you excited about going to Hawaii again. It's just really good.

Lenny (45:45):
Have you seen the second season?

Marily Nika (45:46):
I've seen it and it's so much better than the first, which is rare.

Lenny (45:50):
I agree. Awesome. Love that show. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask, and bonus point if it's AI related.

Marily Nika (45:57):
I love to ask people, how would you explain a database to a three year old? And I know it's kind of an AI, not everyone say ai, but I love asking it because people are thinking the [inaudible 00:46:11], like what did you just ask me? But it's so important to be able to explain things in a simple ring and have the storytelling to convince a kid and really explain technical terms to non-technical people.

Lenny (46:23):
Favorite AI based tool that you think people should check out.

Marily Nika (46:27):
Talk about ChatGPT, now I have this on ChatGPT, this is what comes to mind. Well, the Lensa app was pretty cool too, right? We all plugged in our [inaudible 00:46:36] and we're able to see what they would look like as fantastic heroes. I have to say, I tried being the mail version because it was so much cooler than the KingL version, so that's when I recommend to people, try the mail version.

Lenny (46:48):
That's fun. And they actually have pets now. That's what got me the download and pay for it. You can take pictures of your pets and they look so fun. That's like a killer feature right there. Good job Lensa. And the app is Lensa, right?

Marily Nika (47:01):
Yeah. [inaudible 00:47:02]

Lenny (47:02):
Amazing. Marily, thank you so much for spending time with me, sharing your wisdom. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Marily Nika (47:12):
Thank you so much. People can find me on Instagram. I also have a product channel on YouTube that you can check out. I just started it. I'm getting used to the whole process. I'm also kicking off a newsletter, just any social reach out and you'll see all my links.

Lenny (47:28):
How do they find the YouTube channel? How do they find the newsletter?

Marily Nika (47:31):
Typing Marily Nika.

Lenny (47:32):
Marily, thank you again for being here.

# Product management theater | Marty Cagan (Silicon Valley Product Group)

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams.

Visit sprig.com/lenny to learn more and get 10% off. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's getE-P-P-O.com/lenny. Marty Cagan, welcome back to the podcast.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Who would you say this is most suited for? Is it leaders at companies? Is it ICPMs, everybody? Who do you think would get the most out of this?

Marty Cagan (01:00:36):
We wrote it intentionally, again, unlike the other books. The other books are written for people like us and your audience and my audience. They're product people. These are written for non-product people too. And so the idea is a CEO, a CFO, a head of sale. Anybody who cares about their company changing how they build and wants to help is written for them. So that was one of the hardest parts really, including those kinds of reviewers and making sure all this stuff made sense to them.

Lenny (01:01:08):
So basically if you're listening to this and you're like, I'm working on these teams Marty's describing, I don't think this is optimal. We can do a lot better. We can get a lot more on out feature team, hand this book to your CEO essentially?

Marty Cagan (01:01:22):
And I'd suggest they read it themselves so they know. Because I know I'm going to be talking more about this going forward because I know I need to. Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company. They're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. But really they have a family, they're not going to quit. So I think that's not true. I think there is so much they can do and hopefully they can see that in the book. It's like they can see what they individually can do to push their company in this direction, and at a minimum it'll help their career.

Lenny (01:02:05):
I always love just the message of empowerment and giving people motivation to you can actually make change. You're not stuck in this way of working, and I know you do that a lot. The official title of the book, so it's TRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model. What do you mean when you... There it is. I don't have my copy yet 'cause that hasn't come out in the US yet, otherwise, I'd have it here on my side as well. There it is. It's a beautiful green color by the way. It goes nicely with the other colors. Amazing. Beautiful design, whoever did that. Okay, so the part of the title is Moving to the Product Operating Model. What does that mean?

Marty Cagan (01:02:40):
That was the biggest pain for the book was... 'Cause honestly, I had dodged that question for 20 years. If you look at any of my writing before starting on this book, I just said, "Look, do you want to work like the best or do you want to work like the rest?" That's how we referred to it, the best versus the rest because there is no word, there is no name that talks about the common principles with all the best companies. So we would just say, do you want to work like the best or not? But when I started to write the book, I'm like, okay, I can't just say work like the best. We have to have some name for this, but I don't know if you've come across this Lenny, but you don't want to coin a new term if you can avoid it.

(01:03:27):
It is really painful to try to develop a new term. Some of the companies we worked with use the term product operating model and don't get me wrong, that's not the only term. Some people use the term product led company or product driven company, but those two we just don't like because it gives all the wrong message and the rest of the company thinks it's a power grab. So we wanted to avoid those words. We like product operating model for a couple reasons. One is it's a model, it's a conceptual model. It's not a process. It's not really a thing, it's more of a set of principles and also it's non-threatening to a lot of people. It's just saying, "Look, this is how these companies operate. You can look at it and decide if you think it's good for you too." So we adopted that term, we call it product model for short. And all it really is it boils down to a set of 20 principles and those 20 principles are what we find.

(01:04:36):
Remember we started with this. I was explaining, when I listen to your guests, I'm listening for what's special about each of their companies, but what I'm looking for is the commonality. 'Cause most of the time when I see a successful company, they are living these principles. Principles like you have to experiment. You have to embrace experimentation. If you don't do that, most of this is not possible. Or you have to make sure that everything you release is instrumented so that we can prove the outcome. Stuff like that, that there's a million different methodologies and frameworks and tools and processes, but matters is those principles. And so that's what we mean by that product operating model. There's at a high level we talk about it, is how you decide what you're going to work on? How you decide which problems to solve?

(01:05:33):
That's what most companies do in annual planning, but it's basically the product strategy. That's what your Meta friend was describing that the leaders do. That's their job. The second is how do they solve problems? Do they have the skills to do product discovery like we're talking about? How to actually come up with good solutions that work for the customer and work for the business. That's the second big dimension of the product model. And the third big dimension is how do they actually build, test and deploy product to their customers? Do they do it in a way that is reliable, that is demonstrable where you can show that this generates the outcomes that you need? Those are the three big areas. And then there's a number of competencies. There's four new competencies that most companies don't have, but what makes it tricky is they have people with those titles, but they don't have people with those jobs. The one we've been talking about is product manager.

Lenny (01:06:40):
What would be most interesting to share? You said there's 20 attributes of a power product team.

Marty Cagan (01:06:46):
20 principles.

Lenny (01:06:48):
20 principles. I'm so curious what these are, but I know we don't have time to go through them all. Can you either share a few of those? You shared experimentation as one, or these four what you just mentioned. I'm just curious what these [inaudible 01:06:58]

Marty Cagan (01:06:58):
Well, I could share as much as you want, but the four competencies are product manager. Again, we're talking a serious product manager here, not a product owner, not a feature team product manager. Product manager, real product designer, service design, interaction design, visual design, user research, real product designer, a real tech lead, and then a real product leader, a manager of product design engineering that knows how to coach their people and knows how to do a real product strategy, which is what we were talking about. So those are the four new competencies. For most companies, those are new, meaning they might have people with those names, but they don't have those roles institutionalized.

Lenny (01:07:43):
It's interesting, you're building on the classic triad with this leader above. It's like the stool with something on the stool or something or filling up the stool.

Marty Cagan (01:07:51):
And that is the triad. That's where it came from. The word triad came from those three. We didn't invent that.

Lenny (01:07:58):
Right. But I think the product leader is a really interesting addition there. You can't just have this team off to the side without a product leader overseeing that work.

Marty Cagan (01:08:04):
That's so true because one of the things I really learned with INSPIRED was that it wasn't enough to have the teams do their job. They needed leadership to do their job. So it is both. And that's why I was saying we don't frame it as top-down, bottom-up for that. We frame it as each group doing their job. And when that happens, it's actually a beautiful thing.

Lenny (01:08:28):
We're going to link to a post that you wrote, Product Leadership Theater, which talks about how people do this actually badly and what it looks like when it's just pretend versus actually doing it right.

Marty Cagan (01:08:37):
Good.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Okay. And then what are some of these principles, just to touch on a couple and a few-

Marty Cagan (01:08:42):
Just stop me, but there's a set of principles around the more cultural things, like innovation is more important than predictability. That's a principle. That learning is more important than failure. The principles are more important than process. Some examples of that. In terms of teams, empowered with problems to solve. That's one of your foundational principles. We talked about that, this idea of real ownership, real sense of ownership so that it's theirs. Well, of course in discovery you'd recognize all the principles, but it's about addressing product risks. It's about embracing quick experimentation. It's about testing ideas responsibly. These are principles. And then I did mention a couple of the delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything. These are delivery principles. So none of these should surprise you 'cause they are what's consistent in the good companies that we know, but these are the things that we think matter.

Lenny (01:09:58):
That's awesome. And I imagine people listening to this, if they're in that 10% or 20% of companies that you describe as doing this well are just like, of course. And then the rest are just like, no, there's no way we're going to be able to do that.

Marty Cagan (01:10:09):
You have to realize in most of the rest of the world, they release monthly or mostly quarterly. Think about that. Quarterly releases. Think about it. You cannot take care of your customers. You cannot learn at the pace you need to. By the way, quality is going to be terrible in that model.

Lenny (01:10:30):
I don't want to go on this tangent necessarily, but I know in some cases, like a quarterly release, like Shopify as an example, they have seasonal releases like the winter launch and the summer launch.

Marty Cagan (01:10:40):
And salesforce.com has a big... But don't confuse the actual releasing by the teams with the marketing releases. So it's very normal and I think wise to batch. Because look, most product teams are releasing on the order of 20 times per day. You're going to do a marketing release 20 times a day? That would be useless. So it makes sense to have messaging on a periodic basis, but good companies, by the time they message it, it's live. It's been coming out. We may have released some things dark as you know, but we've got it in production solid. We've proven each thing probably with an AB test.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Airbnb is actually in that same model. Most of the stuff they announced every couple times a year is already out or an experiment to most people. One thing I wanted to clarify, so you call this the product operating model. There's also this role product ops, which you touched on a little bit. Any thoughts on product ops? We've had a few guests here talk about it.

Marty Cagan (01:11:43):
It's tricky. First of all, some people have asked me, is product ops the same as product operating model? No. That was just a very unfortunate name conflict, but product ops is more analogous to DevOps and design ops, that's all. Now, can you use product ops in the product operating model? Absolutely, if you're using one of the definitions that are part of the model. So for example, the heart of product ops in the good companies I know is user research and data analysts. And the only difference is they're now brought together under one product ops leader. That's all. That that is the same. How long has that been with us, Lenny? More than 20 years. Companies have had user research teams and have had data analyst teams to help you make decisions qualitatively and help you make teams quantitatively. So that's not new at all, but it is good. And I think there is some amount of value about bringing that in.

(01:12:52):
Some companies, of course, they interpret and define product ops very differently. A lot of them unfortunately think of it, they focus on the whole phrase of process in governance. That's a huge red flag and I try to tell people, if that's what you see, run. Don't walk away from that. The other thing that's going on in a lot of companies, it is amazing to me how creative companies can be to try to find a way to justify giving product managers assistance because the product manager says too much work, which is really ironic to me 'cause they're usually feature teams that are saying this and I'm like, "It's not even enough for your job." But anyway, they're like, "Too much work." And so they're like, "Well, we need help." And so for a while, they would all have these little associate product managers. And then a lot of companies they have, oh, we also have product owners.

(01:13:51):
Product manager and product owner makes no sense. Huge anti-pattern. Today a lot of companies use the same excuse, but its product manager has product ops people to do the dirty work. No. And honestly, I would not want to be one of those people because I think they're very vulnerable right now.

Lenny (01:14:12):
I've changed my mind on product ops. One reason is because I also was like, "I don't need another person in the loop on everything I'm doing. I just want to have..." I don't know why I would do that even though I have endless work and I have working crazy hours. But I think one of the great things about product ops people that I talk to is there's not many of them. You need one often to do a ton and to help a lot of different teams, so it's not like a team that just grows like crazy.

Marty Cagan (01:14:37):
That's what I like. Same with user research, by the way, and you had a very good guest on that I think tried to make that point as well, a small high leverage group. So it works for data analysts and it works for user research where they are helping the teams do the work they need to do, but that's where it really depends what they're doing. I will tell you I've seen too many companies where the product leaders are not doing their job, so what they do is they hire product ops to try to do their job. They're the ones now responsible for educating the product managers. That's just not good.

Lenny (01:15:13):
I have just a few more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Actually, maybe just one more question. We'll see where this goes. So I've mentioned this earlier that a lot of startup founders are just like, "I do not need product managers. I'm not going to hire them ever. Or maybe I'll wait until I have hundreds of engineers." But then I find many of them change their mind, bring in a PM and they're like, "Oh wow, this is amazing. Why didn't I do this earlier? This person, it's exactly what I needed." And these are guests I've had on the podcast that were like, "We don't need PMs." And then they get one and they're like, "Okay, I see. This is great." Do you have any advice for founders that are in this boat of just like, I don't want product managers, they're going to screw us up, they're going to slow us down? Any advice for this?

Marty Cagan (01:15:53):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm one of the people that tries to discourage them from hiring product managers too soon because a lot of them make the mistake of hiring them too soon. Now, realize what we're talking about here, again, the whole discussion we've had, this is other layer to, I'm talking about a real product manager. If they're using them as project manager, which a lot of times they are, well, I would tell them they're overpaying, but okay, you can get some help for project management. That's not a good use of the CEO's time. But if they're a real product manager and they're worried about value and viability, that is the founder's job. So the founder should be doing that and needs to be doing that, and it usually causes conflict if they bring in a real product manager too soon. It's too many cooks in the kitchen.

(01:16:45):
You need to reach a certain scale before it helps you to have other people responsible for value and viability. That all assumes that they understand real product management, otherwise it's going to lead to very different symptoms.

Lenny (01:17:01):
So I think one piece of advice here is after product-market fit is a better time to hire a product manager. Otherwise, they're just between you and the product and it slows everything down, right?

Marty Cagan (01:17:10):
Yeah. Remember, usually as soon as you get product-market fit, you're working on it for other products and other markets, and so it's an ongoing thing, but while it's small, it usually is most useful just to look at the number of engineers. At a certain number of engineers, usually 20 to 25, it's a lot better if the co-founder is the product person for that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. I was going to ask you if you have a heuristic for engineers and so thank you for preempting that. That's essentially all I had to chat about, Marty. Do you have anything else that you think would be interesting to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Marty Cagan (01:17:51):
Honestly, Lenny, we talked about so many big topics. I'm worried that may have overwhelmed people, I hope not. Because you asked all the hardest topics.

Lenny (01:18:03):
Well, good job me. Good job you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Marty Cagan (01:18:09):
Sure.

Lenny (01:18:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Marty Cagan (01:18:15):
I love the new book from Tony Fadell called Build. It's a wonderful book and he's describing the product model, but for hardware devices and his perspective was fabulous. He had a front row seat to some of the most iconic products in the world, the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest devices. Love it. So I loved his book and I've been recommending it to all kinds of people. Another one I really liked is, do you know Tim Urban, the guy behind Wait But Why?

Lenny (01:18:45):
Absolutely.

Marty Cagan (01:18:46):
I just love the way this guy thinks. And he wrote a book called What's Our Problem? that I found really provocative. Challenged me in a hundred different ways, so love that.

Lenny (01:18:56):
I've been reading about his book writing process as he was writing it over the many years and it was just quite a journey he went on to make that book happen. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Marty Cagan (01:19:09):
Lenny, you couldn't ask that to a worst person 'cause I watch almost nothing, so not a good one for that.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Great. I think that's often for the best. Do you have a favorite interview question that you either use yourself or find useful when interviewing folks, product managers especially?

Marty Cagan (01:19:26):
Well, given how much interviewing I do, I stopped giving out my real favorite questions because they became online. But I do have a go-to question that I pretty much start with everybody and I want to know if they can even define the job of a product manager.

Lenny (01:19:41):
What do you find in the answer and what do you look for? Is it just how close they are to your version of a product manager?

Marty Cagan (01:19:49):
I can tell where they learned from their answer, that's all. They don't have to give my answer. They just shouldn't give the old feature team answer, that's all.

Lenny (01:20:00):
Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love, whether it's software or something physical, something around the house?

Marty Cagan (01:20:06):
I recently got a Rivian, which is amazing that they did an absolutely beautiful job. They're the Airbnb of car companies because the founder's a designer and imagine if a designer designed the next generation car. It's a phenomenally good job.

Lenny (01:20:27):
Wow. I was imagining you could rent people's cars and that sounds pretty cool, but you mean it in a different way. Interestingly, both you and [inaudible 01:20:38] from Meta both had cars as your favorite recent product discovery. He had a Mercedes-Benz. And I made the joke that I hope to give away these products someday and the budget is blowing up with all these cars in the mix.

Marty Cagan (01:20:52):
Well, my favorite thing to do is ride motorcycles and there is a new generation of product that who knows, might save my life one day, but these are literally wireless airbag vests that you wear and it uses AI technology and sensors to decide if it should deploy. Luckily, mine has never had to go off, but I know for a lot of people it saved their lives. That's an example of technology where without the technology, it's a very vulnerable... Even with it, it's vulnerable.

Lenny (01:21:28):
Wait, do you ride motorcycles?

Marty Cagan (01:21:29):
I do.

Lenny (01:21:30):
I had no idea. What bike do you ride?

Marty Cagan (01:21:33):
I have two and they're both BMWs.

Lenny (01:21:36):
Wow. We need to see a picture of this somewhere. That's amazing. I had no idea. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family and find useful either in work or in life?

Marty Cagan (01:21:49):
I don't really have a life motto, but I do have one I share a lot with people because as you might imagine, I think writing really helps me think and I encourage other people to develop their thinking skills and there's a great quote from Leslie Lamport, the guy who... You're not old enough to know this, but he invented one of the first word processors called LaTeX, which I used to use back in the day. But if you're thinking without writing, you just think you're thinking.

Lenny (01:22:21):
There's a version of this that I love and it's the same idea that I don't know what I think until I've written it down. I think Joan Didion said that.

Marty Cagan (01:22:29):
Same idea.

Lenny (01:22:30):
And I so agree. That's why I started writing. I just want to figure this out that I have in my head. Crystallizing something that makes sense. Last question. You've been doing this work for many, many years now. How many years have you been at this?

Marty Cagan (01:22:43):
43.

Lenny (01:22:45):
43 years. What else would you have been doing right now if not having gone down this track?

Marty Cagan (01:22:53):
Oh, well, honestly, I would've been really happy just staying in engineering. I've always loved design too. I think I would've been really happy as a designer. I think no matter what though, I would have been still building something, whether if it was houses or cars or whatever. I like building things.

Lenny (01:23:13):
I love that. You're essentially a one man triad team in this dream. Marty, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. We covered so much stuff. I think we're going to help a lot of people transform. Two final questions, where can folks find your book? When is it available? Where can they reach out if they want to follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:23:34):
The book should be available worldwide in electronic Kindle audio and hardback on March 12th. We'll see, but that's what the publishers promise. And you can find about all of the things I talk about and all our stuff is for free on the website, svpg.com, Silicon Valley Product Group. And if you don't know at least one of the partners, you should try to meet one. We all love meeting the community and I think you'll enjoy it. So hopefully that's useful.

Lenny (01:24:12):
We've had two partners so far. We'll work our way through the rest over time. And I want to make sure you answer the last question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:24:20):
To be honest, a lot of the inspiration for what we write comes from questions from people, and so we love it when people read something and if it works, great, and they tell us, we love that too. But if they have follow-up questions, one of the nice things about the online archive is we'll just go update the article to address the question. So we love that.

Lenny (01:24:40):
You do the same thing.

Marty Cagan (01:24:41):
So feel free.

Lenny (01:24:42):
All right. Amazing. Marty, thank you so much for making time to do this and for being here.

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams. They're the only platform with product level AI, meaning it analyzes data across all of your studies to centralize the most important product opportunities, trends, and correlations in one real time feed. Visit sprig.com/lenny to learn more and get 10% off. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's getE-P-P-O.com/lenny. Marty Cagan, welcome back to the podcast.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Who would you say this is most suited for? Is it leaders at companies? Is it ICPMs, everybody? Who do you think would get the most out of this?

Marty Cagan (01:00:36):
We wrote it intentionally, again, unlike the other books. The other books are written for people like us and your audience and my audience. They're product people. These are written for non-product people too. And so the idea is a CEO, a CFO, a head of sale. Anybody who cares about their company changing how they build and wants to help is written for them. So that was one of the hardest parts really, including those kinds of reviewers and making sure all this stuff made sense to them.

Lenny (01:01:08):
So basically if you're listening to this and you're like, I'm working on these teams Marty's describing, I don't think this is optimal. We can do a lot better. We can get a lot more on out feature team, hand this book to your CEO essentially?

Marty Cagan (01:01:22):
And I'd suggest they read it themselves so they know. Because I know I'm going to be talking more about this going forward because I know I need to. Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company. They're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. But really they have a family, they're not going to quit. So I think that's not true. I think there is so much they can do and hopefully they can see that in the book. It's like they can see what they individually can do to push their company in this direction, and at a minimum it'll help their career.

Lenny (01:02:05):
I always love just the message of empowerment and giving people motivation to you can actually make change. You're not stuck in this way of working, and I know you do that a lot. The official title of the book, so it's TRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model. What do you mean when you... There it is. I don't have my copy yet 'cause that hasn't come out in the US yet, otherwise, I'd have it here on my side as well. There it is. It's a beautiful green color by the way. It goes nicely with the other colors. Amazing. Beautiful design, whoever did that. Okay, so the part of the title is Moving to the Product Operating Model. What does that mean?

Marty Cagan (01:02:40):
That was the biggest pain for the book was... 'Cause honestly, I had dodged that question for 20 years. If you look at any of my writing before starting on this book, I just said, "Look, do you want to work like the best or do you want to work like the rest?" That's how we referred to it, the best versus the rest because there is no word, there is no name that talks about the common principles with all the best companies. So we would just say, do you want to work like the best or not? But when I started to write the book, I'm like, okay, I can't just say work like the best. We have to have some name for this, but I don't know if you've come across this Lenny, but you don't want to coin a new term if you can avoid it.

(01:03:27):
It is really painful to try to develop a new term. Some of the companies we worked with use the term product operating model and don't get me wrong, that's not the only term. Some people use the term product led company or product driven company, but those two we just don't like because it gives all the wrong message and the rest of the company thinks it's a power grab. So we wanted to avoid those words. We like product operating model for a couple reasons. One is it's a model, it's a conceptual model. It's not a process. It's not really a thing, it's more of a set of principles and also it's non-threatening to a lot of people. It's just saying, "Look, this is how these companies operate. You can look at it and decide if you think it's good for you too." So we adopted that term, we call it product model for short. And all it really is it boils down to a set of 20 principles and those 20 principles are what we find.

(01:04:36):
Remember we started with this. I was explaining, when I listen to your guests, I'm listening for what's special about each of their companies, but what I'm looking for is the commonality. 'Cause most of the time when I see a successful company, they are living these principles. Principles like you have to experiment. You have to embrace experimentation. If you don't do that, most of this is not possible. Or you have to make sure that everything you release is instrumented so that we can prove the outcome. Stuff like that, that there's a million different methodologies and frameworks and tools and processes, but matters is those principles. And so that's what we mean by that product operating model. There's at a high level we talk about it, is how you decide what you're going to work on? How you decide which problems to solve?

(01:05:33):
That's what most companies do in annual planning, but it's basically the product strategy. That's what your Meta friend was describing that the leaders do. That's their job. The second is how do they solve problems? Do they have the skills to do product discovery like we're talking about? How to actually come up with good solutions that work for the customer and work for the business. That's the second big dimension of the product model. And the third big dimension is how do they actually build, test and deploy product to their customers? Do they do it in a way that is reliable, that is demonstrable where you can show that this generates the outcomes that you need? Those are the three big areas. And then there's a number of competencies. There's four new competencies that most companies don't have, but what makes it tricky is they have people with those titles, but they don't have people with those jobs. The one we've been talking about is product manager.

Lenny (01:06:40):
What would be most interesting to share? You said there's 20 attributes of a power product team.

Marty Cagan (01:06:46):
20 principles.

Lenny (01:06:48):
20 principles. I'm so curious what these are, but I know we don't have time to go through them all. Can you either share a few of those? You shared experimentation as one, or these four what you just mentioned. I'm just curious what these [inaudible 01:06:58]

Marty Cagan (01:06:58):
Well, I could share as much as you want, but the four competencies are product manager. Again, we're talking a serious product manager here, not a product owner, not a feature team product manager. Product manager, real product designer, service design, interaction design, visual design, user research, real product designer, a real tech lead, and then a real product leader, a manager of product design engineering that knows how to coach their people and knows how to do a real product strategy, which is what we were talking about. So those are the four new competencies. For most companies, those are new, meaning they might have people with those names, but they don't have those roles institutionalized.

Lenny (01:07:43):
It's interesting, you're building on the classic triad with this leader above. It's like the stool with something on the stool or something or filling up the stool.

Marty Cagan (01:07:51):
And that is the triad. That's where it came from. The word triad came from those three. We didn't invent that.

Lenny (01:07:58):
Right. But I think the product leader is a really interesting addition there. You can't just have this team off to the side without a product leader overseeing that work.

Marty Cagan (01:08:04):
That's so true because one of the things I really learned with INSPIRED was that it wasn't enough to have the teams do their job. They needed leadership to do their job. So it is both. And that's why I was saying we don't frame it as top-down, bottom-up for that. We frame it as each group doing their job. And when that happens, it's actually a beautiful thing.

Lenny (01:08:28):
We're going to link to a post that you wrote, Product Leadership Theater, which talks about how people do this actually badly and what it looks like when it's just pretend versus actually doing it right.

Marty Cagan (01:08:37):
Good.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Okay. And then what are some of these principles, just to touch on a couple and a few-

Marty Cagan (01:08:42):
Just stop me, but there's a set of principles around the more cultural things, like innovation is more important than predictability. That's a principle. That learning is more important than failure. The principles are more important than process. Some examples of that. In terms of teams, empowered with problems to solve. That's one of your foundational principles. We talked about that, this idea of real ownership, real sense of ownership so that it's theirs. Well, of course in discovery you'd recognize all the principles, but it's about addressing product risks. It's about embracing quick experimentation. It's about testing ideas responsibly. These are principles. And then I did mention a couple of the delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything. These are delivery principles. So none of these should surprise you 'cause they are what's consistent in the good companies that we know, but these are the things that we think matter.

Lenny (01:09:58):
That's awesome. And I imagine people listening to this, if they're in that 10% or 20% of companies that you describe as doing this well are just like, of course. And then the rest are just like, no, there's no way we're going to be able to do that.

Marty Cagan (01:10:09):
You have to realize in most of the rest of the world, they release monthly or mostly quarterly. Think about that. Quarterly releases. Think about it. You cannot take care of your customers. You cannot learn at the pace you need to. By the way, quality is going to be terrible in that model.

Lenny (01:10:30):
I don't want to go on this tangent necessarily, but I know in some cases, like a quarterly release, like Shopify as an example, they have seasonal releases like the winter launch and the summer launch.

Marty Cagan (01:10:40):
And salesforce.com has a big... But don't confuse the actual releasing by the teams with the marketing releases. So it's very normal and I think wise to batch. Because look, most product teams are releasing on the order of 20 times per day. You're going to do a marketing release 20 times a day? That would be useless. So it makes sense to have messaging on a periodic basis, but good companies, by the time they message it, it's live. It's been coming out. We may have released some things dark as you know, but we've got it in production solid. We've proven each thing probably with an AB test.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Airbnb is actually in that same model. Most of the stuff they announced every couple times a year is already out or an experiment to most people. One thing I wanted to clarify, so you call this the product operating model. There's also this role product ops, which you touched on a little bit. Any thoughts on product ops? We've had a few guests here talk about it.

Marty Cagan (01:11:43):
It's tricky. First of all, some people have asked me, is product ops the same as product operating model? No. That was just a very unfortunate name conflict, but product ops is more analogous to DevOps and design ops, that's all. Now, can you use product ops in the product operating model? Absolutely, if you're using one of the definitions that are part of the model. So for example, the heart of product ops in the good companies I know is user research and data analysts. And the only difference is they're now brought together under one product ops leader. That's all. That that is the same. How long has that been with us, Lenny? More than 20 years. Companies have had user research teams and have had data analyst teams to help you make decisions qualitatively and help you make teams quantitatively. So that's not new at all, but it is good. And I think there is some amount of value about bringing that in.

(01:12:52):
Some companies, of course, they interpret and define product ops very differently. A lot of them unfortunately think of it, they focus on the whole phrase of process in governance. That's a huge red flag and I try to tell people, if that's what you see, run. Don't walk away from that. The other thing that's going on in a lot of companies, it is amazing to me how creative companies can be to try to find a way to justify giving product managers assistance because the product manager says too much work, which is really ironic to me 'cause they're usually feature teams that are saying this and I'm like, "It's not even enough for your job." But anyway, they're like, "Too much work." And so they're like, "Well, we need help." And so for a while, they would all have these little associate product managers. And then a lot of companies they have, oh, we also have product owners.

(01:13:51):
Product manager and product owner makes no sense. Huge anti-pattern. Today a lot of companies use the same excuse, but its product manager has product ops people to do the dirty work. No. And honestly, I would not want to be one of those people because I think they're very vulnerable right now.

Lenny (01:14:12):
I've changed my mind on product ops. One reason is because I also was like, "I don't need another person in the loop on everything I'm doing. I just want to have..." I don't know why I would do that even though I have endless work and I have working crazy hours. But I think one of the great things about product ops people that I talk to is there's not many of them. You need one often to do a ton and to help a lot of different teams, so it's not like a team that just grows like crazy.

Marty Cagan (01:14:37):
That's what I like. Same with user research, by the way, and you had a very good guest on that I think tried to make that point as well, a small high leverage group. So it works for data analysts and it works for user research where they are helping the teams do the work they need to do, but that's where it really depends what they're doing. I will tell you I've seen too many companies where the product leaders are not doing their job, so what they do is they hire product ops to try to do their job. They're the ones now responsible for educating the product managers. That's just not good.

Lenny (01:15:13):
I have just a few more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Actually, maybe just one more question. We'll see where this goes. So I've mentioned this earlier that a lot of startup founders are just like, "I do not need product managers. I'm not going to hire them ever. Or maybe I'll wait until I have hundreds of engineers." But then I find many of them change their mind, bring in a PM and they're like, "Oh wow, this is amazing. Why didn't I do this earlier? This person, it's exactly what I needed." And these are guests I've had on the podcast that were like, "We don't need PMs." And then they get one and they're like, "Okay, I see. This is great." Do you have any advice for founders that are in this boat of just like, I don't want product managers, they're going to screw us up, they're going to slow us down? Any advice for this?

Marty Cagan (01:15:53):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm one of the people that tries to discourage them from hiring product managers too soon because a lot of them make the mistake of hiring them too soon. Now, realize what we're talking about here, again, the whole discussion we've had, this is other layer to, I'm talking about a real product manager. If they're using them as project manager, which a lot of times they are, well, I would tell them they're overpaying, but okay, you can get some help for project management. That's not a good use of the CEO's time. But if they're a real product manager and they're worried about value and viability, that is the founder's job. So the founder should be doing that and needs to be doing that, and it usually causes conflict if they bring in a real product manager too soon. It's too many cooks in the kitchen.

(01:16:45):
You need to reach a certain scale before it helps you to have other people responsible for value and viability. That all assumes that they understand real product management, otherwise it's going to lead to very different symptoms.

Lenny (01:17:01):
So I think one piece of advice here is after product-market fit is a better time to hire a product manager. Otherwise, they're just between you and the product and it slows everything down, right?

Marty Cagan (01:17:10):
Yeah. Remember, usually as soon as you get product-market fit, you're working on it for other products and other markets, and so it's an ongoing thing, but while it's small, it usually is most useful just to look at the number of engineers. At a certain number of engineers, usually 20 to 25, it's a lot better if the co-founder is the product person for that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. I was going to ask you if you have a heuristic for engineers and so thank you for preempting that. That's essentially all I had to chat about, Marty. Do you have anything else that you think would be interesting to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Marty Cagan (01:17:51):
Honestly, Lenny, we talked about so many big topics. I'm worried that may have overwhelmed people, I hope not. Because you asked all the hardest topics.

Lenny (01:18:03):
Well, good job me. Good job you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Marty Cagan (01:18:09):
Sure.

Lenny (01:18:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Marty Cagan (01:18:15):
I love the new book from Tony Fadell called Build. It's a wonderful book and he's describing the product model, but for hardware devices and his perspective was fabulous. He had a front row seat to some of the most iconic products in the world, the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest devices. Love it. So I loved his book and I've been recommending it to all kinds of people. Another one I really liked is, do you know Tim Urban, the guy behind Wait But Why?

Lenny (01:18:45):
Absolutely.

Marty Cagan (01:18:46):
I just love the way this guy thinks. And he wrote a book called What's Our Problem? that I found really provocative. Challenged me in a hundred different ways, so love that.

Lenny (01:18:56):
I've been reading about his book writing process as he was writing it over the many years and it was just quite a journey he went on to make that book happen. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Marty Cagan (01:19:09):
Lenny, you couldn't ask that to a worst person 'cause I watch almost nothing, so not a good one for that.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Great. I think that's often for the best. Do you have a favorite interview question that you either use yourself or find useful when interviewing folks, product managers especially?

Marty Cagan (01:19:26):
Well, given how much interviewing I do, I stopped giving out my real favorite questions because they became online. But I do have a go-to question that I pretty much start with everybody and I want to know if they can even define the job of a product manager.

Lenny (01:19:41):
What do you find in the answer and what do you look for? Is it just how close they are to your version of a product manager?

Marty Cagan (01:19:49):
I can tell where they learned from their answer, that's all. They don't have to give my answer. They just shouldn't give the old feature team answer, that's all.

Lenny (01:20:00):
Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love, whether it's software or something physical, something around the house?

Marty Cagan (01:20:06):
I recently got a Rivian, which is amazing that they did an absolutely beautiful job. They're the Airbnb of car companies because the founder's a designer and imagine if a designer designed the next generation car. It's a phenomenally good job.

Lenny (01:20:27):
Wow. I was imagining you could rent people's cars and that sounds pretty cool, but you mean it in a different way. Interestingly, both you and [inaudible 01:20:38] from Meta both had cars as your favorite recent product discovery. He had a Mercedes-Benz. And I made the joke that I hope to give away these products someday and the budget is blowing up with all these cars in the mix.

Marty Cagan (01:20:52):
Well, my favorite thing to do is ride motorcycles and there is a new generation of product that who knows, might save my life one day, but these are literally wireless airbag vests that you wear and it uses AI technology and sensors to decide if it should deploy. Luckily, mine has never had to go off, but I know for a lot of people it saved their lives. That's an example of technology where without the technology, it's a very vulnerable... Even with it, it's vulnerable.

Lenny (01:21:28):
Wait, do you ride motorcycles?

Marty Cagan (01:21:29):
I do.

Lenny (01:21:30):
I had no idea. What bike do you ride?

Marty Cagan (01:21:33):
I have two and they're both BMWs.

Lenny (01:21:36):
Wow. We need to see a picture of this somewhere. That's amazing. I had no idea. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family and find useful either in work or in life?

Marty Cagan (01:21:49):
I don't really have a life motto, but I do have one I share a lot with people because as you might imagine, I think writing really helps me think and I encourage other people to develop their thinking skills and there's a great quote from Leslie Lamport, the guy who... You're not old enough to know this, but he invented one of the first word processors called LaTeX, which I used to use back in the day. But if you're thinking without writing, you just think you're thinking.

Lenny (01:22:21):
There's a version of this that I love and it's the same idea that I don't know what I think until I've written it down. I think Joan Didion said that.

Marty Cagan (01:22:29):
Same idea.

Lenny (01:22:30):
And I so agree. That's why I started writing. I just want to figure this out that I have in my head. Crystallizing something that makes sense. Last question. You've been doing this work for many, many years now. How many years have you been at this?

Marty Cagan (01:22:43):
43.

Lenny (01:22:45):
43 years. What else would you have been doing right now if not having gone down this track?

Marty Cagan (01:22:53):
Oh, well, honestly, I would've been really happy just staying in engineering. I've always loved design too. I think I would've been really happy as a designer. I think no matter what though, I would have been still building something, whether if it was houses or cars or whatever. I like building things.

Lenny (01:23:13):
I love that. You're essentially a one man triad team in this dream. Marty, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. We covered so much stuff. I think we're going to help a lot of people transform. Two final questions, where can folks find your book? When is it available? Where can they reach out if they want to follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:23:34):
The book should be available worldwide in electronic Kindle audio and hardback on March 12th. We'll see, but that's what the publishers promise. And you can find about all of the things I talk about and all our stuff is for free on the website, svpg.com, Silicon Valley Product Group. And if you don't know at least one of the partners, you should try to meet one. We all love meeting the community and I think you'll enjoy it. So hopefully that's useful.

Lenny (01:24:12):
We've had two partners so far. We'll work our way through the rest over time. And I want to make sure you answer the last question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:24:20):
To be honest, a lot of the inspiration for what we write comes from questions from people, and so we love it when people read something and if it works, great, and they tell us, we love that too. But if they have follow-up questions, one of the nice things about the online archive is we'll just go update the article to address the question. So we love that.

Lenny (01:24:40):
You do the same thing.

Marty Cagan (01:24:41):
So feel free.

Lenny (01:24:42):
All right. Amazing. Marty, thank you so much for making time to do this and for being here.

Marty Cagan (01:24:47):

# How to speak more confidently and persuasively | Matt Abrahams (professor, speaker, author)

## Transcript

Matt Abrahams (00:00:00):
Visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking, but getting up to the stage, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time, and there's good research to say that this desensitizes people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
Most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk.

Matt Abrahams (00:00:20):
You actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:00:34):
Strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just answer the question. Just give the feedback. Just be engaged in the small talk. By doing that, you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Matt Abrahams. Matt is a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business where he teaches a very popular class on communication and public speaking. He's also the host of the incredibly popular podcast, Think Fast, Talk Smart; and the author of the very popular book, Think Faster and Talk Smarter. Matt also coaches people one-on-one on public speaking and communication skills. And in our conversation we focus on the two areas that people most need help with. One, reducing their anxiety before and during any form of public speaking, and getting better at speaking on the spot, including giving better toasts, giving feedback, doing Q&A, and even apologizing.

(00:01:36):
Like we talk about in the actual conversation, speaking well is a superpower in your career for interviewing, for being great in meetings, for pitching your manager on ideas, to leading teams. And the skill becomes even more important as you grow in your career. The good news is that you can get better at it with a bit of help. I've worked on this a lot over the course of my career and I still get really nervous before big talks and even before every podcast episode, but many of these techniques I actually put into practice and I share that in our conversation. If you pick just a couple things from this episode to put into practice, you'll become a better communicator, you'll be less nervous, and you'll get better at dealing with on-the-spot moments.

(00:04:50):
Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:04:54):
Lenny, I am excited for our conversation and thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
Thank you for being here. I'm even more excited for the conversation. So what I want to do with our time today is there's two areas I want to focus. One is talking about techniques to help people manage anxiety when public speaking. And two is helping people get better at speaking on the spot, which you wrote a whole book about. And if you think about it, I think that's like most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk. It's usually like you said, Q&A or a or toast someone wants to give you or ask for feedback or things like that. So I'm excited to dig into those things. How do that sound broadly?

Matt Abrahams (00:05:33):
Absolutely, I look forward to that and those are topics I'm very excited to talk about, have done a lot of research in and look forward to sharing more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):
I suspected as much. Okay, so let's talk about anxiety. You have a bunch of really novel techniques in your book and your podcast for calming your body down, calming your mind down when you're planning to give a talk, when you're actually about to give a talk, when you're giving a talk. And a lot of these I haven't actually seen anywhere else and I've used a few of them and they are really great. So what I was thinking we'd do is let me go through the ones that I found most useful and interesting and just share your advice on those and then see if there's any I missed and then maybe add those at the end. How's that?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:15):
That sounds great. That sounds great. I love that you've applied some of these techniques and found value from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:19):
I'll talk about this, I'll talk about this. Okay, first of all, just to catch on this, you're not a fan of the picture people in your audience naked approach, correct?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:27):
The Brady Bunch advice is not good advice. I don't know about you and I don't know anybody who could imagine seeing a bunch of people in their underwear and feel more comfortable with that. And I think if you do, there are other issues you need to be dealing with than beyond speaking anxiety.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:42):
Yeah, it feels like highly inappropriate now, just that idea, trying to picture everyone-

Matt Abrahams (00:06:46):
No, but underlying that if you'll give me a moment, there is some value. This notion of visualization as a tool of desensitization actually can be very helpful, but you're not visualizing the audience half naked. What you're doing is you're visualizing yourself in that space. You're visualizing the audience responding to you and what you're saying. So just like a pilot might do a flight simulator, having a visualization can actually really help you feel more comfortable and confident. It literally puts you in the room even though you're not there. And there's some tools and I'm fascinated by these tools that are virtual reality tools that can also serve to desensitize you. So this notion of seeing your audience in advance of actually speaking can actually impact your level of comfort. It's let's keep everybody clothed and let's keep them all focused on your topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
Well, let's actually talk about this one while we're on it because I think this is a really powerful technique. An idea just to kind of summarize, you picture ahead of time, what it's going to look like and feel like. You talking, looking at the audience. You talk about that and just how to go about using that technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:07:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And this is some of the oldest research on public speaking anxiety. It was research done in the '80s from the University of Oregon. So visualization, what it does is it allows you to see the event in a way that you have much more control over it so you can think about it. So a good visualization involves some deep breathing to calm yourself. Either you close your eyes or you just look at a picture. Maybe you can get a picture of the environment you're speaking in. I often recommend speakers see the room even if they're not physically present, but get a picture online or some way envision yourself in the room, envision yourself in the room with the people you'll be speaking to. Often we know the individuals or some of them. We can also go online and figure out who they are.

(00:08:39):
So visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking but getting up to the stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. And by taking yourself through that you in essence are a dress rehearsal even though you're not physically in the room. And there's good research to say that this desensitizes people. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time where they'll do visualization to help them and it really does work. And like I said, there are virtual tools now that can help you do this where you can actually program it to have a certain size audience. You can even program some of these to have a responsive audience or a distracted audience. All of this in service of just preparing you for what you're really going to see.

(00:09:25):
And the bottom line is this, what you're doing for yourself is making sure it's not new and novel. It's something been there, done that, even though if it was virtual or visualized in your mind, to help you feel better about the circumstance. It gives you a sense of agency.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):
I've done this myself actually. I gave a TEDx talk once and it was probably the scariest talk I've ever given and I spent a lot of time doing this and it doesn't actually have to take that much time. It could be like a five-minute thing where you sit down, calm yourself, and then just picture the stuff. And ideally you do it a couple times, I imagine.

Matt Abrahams (00:09:57):
That's right. Good for you. And congratulations on giving a TEDx talk. That is a high-stakes talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
Thank you. That was before TEDx became super uncool. It was still pretty early. It's out there in the internet in case people want to find it.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:09):
Don't say they're uncool. I'm doing one in two weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:11):
They're so cool. That is, they are cool.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:13):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):
They're incredible. I'm impressed.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:17):
I've done a number of them and I've coached many people and I think that there's a lot of value that they can provide people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
There is. There is. I think they've just become slightly less cool because now there's a lot of them, but they're still incredibly cool, I'm very proud.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:29):
Okay, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):
So on the visualization piece, I think we have a lot of techniques, but just on this one, part of it is continue to calm yourself as you're doing it. I think that's really important because you want to help your body not connect to the stress that you're feeling like you're going to experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:46):
That's correct. Any distance you can give yourself from the anxiety that you're feeling is helpful and there are lots of techniques that help give you a little bit of distance and visualization is one of those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:57):
One of my favorite techniques that it might be in this bucket, it might be on the spot advice bucket, but I think it works great here is what you call dare to be dull. Can you talk about that because I love that?

Matt Abrahams (00:11:09):
Yeah. I really leaned into this with the spontaneous speaking work that I've been doing as of late, but it applies to anybody speaking. This is a notion that comes from the world of improvisation and when people hear improv, they often think of standup comedy, having to be funny. And that's not what improv is all about. Improv is all about being present, being collaborative, being open, and it's a wonderful tool just to help you get present oriented. Think of it as like meditation in action, but also it teaches lots of valuable skills for communication.

(00:11:42):
When we communicate, especially spontaneously, we want to do it really well. We want to answer the question with the best answer, we want to give the right feedback, we want to be the most interesting in small talk and that puts a lot of pressure on ourselves. And you can think of it this way, it's really taxing our cognitive bandwidth.

(00:12:04):
Your brain in many ways is like a CPU, a computer. It's not a perfect analogy, but it works. And if I am constantly judging and evaluating everything I am saying against some standard of perfection, whatever that is, it means I have a limited amount of bandwidth to focus on what I'm actually saying and connecting to my audience. If you have a laptop or a phone that has lots of windows and apps open, each one of those is performing less well because of the other ones being open. So I often say strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just get the task done, just answer the question, just give the feedback, just be engaged in the small talk. And by doing that you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed. So dare to be dull is all about giving yourself permission to just be present and do what's needed. And when you do that you find that you actually do quite a good job at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
The last point I think is really important, you talk about this in your book. Is when you start with, "Okay, I'm just going to say something, it'll be fine." Without that pressure, you end up saying something better and more interesting and more insightful because you're less nervous about it.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:16):
That's exactly right. We are often our biggest impediments to good communication because of the anxiety we bring to the party.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
That's awesome. And I think this can apply to prepared talks too. When you're preparing a deck, don't put this pressure on yourself, "This has to be the best talk ever." Just like, "I'm going to do my best. Let me just start with something that's good enough." People learn something and then from that, their editing ends up leading to something great in my experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:39):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:40):
Awesome. Okay, let's go to the next technique, and this is another one I've practiced and another guest on the podcast actually suggested this and these two remind me of using this one, which is to tell yourself when you're going to be giving a talk. "I'm excited. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'm so excited to give this talk." And reframe it from, "I'm nervous," to like, "No, I'm excited. This is going to be amazing." Can you talk about that technique?

Matt Abrahams (00:14:04):
Absolutely. So this is one of many cognitive reframing techniques. It is often attributed to my friend and colleague, Alison Wood Brooks, she's at Harvard Business School who did some research into this. And what she found is...

(00:14:18):
Well, first take a step back. When you get physically aroused by anxiety, you're under that fight or flight threat response. It turns out that same response happens to your body when you're excited. The human body has pretty much just one arousal response. Our heart beats faster, we breathe more shallow, we get a little shaky, but the big difference is how we label that. So if I say, "Hey Lenny, guess what? Your colleague couldn't show up today and you need to go teach the class or you need to go give that presentation." You might feel your heart rate go up, get a little shaky, sweat on your brow and you're seeing that as negative. But if I said, "Hey Lenny, guess what? You just won the lottery." Same physiological response would happen, but you would see that likely as more positive.

(00:15:06):
So how we label the arousal matters and what Alison's research and others have followed up with suggests is that when we feel those symptoms of anxiety, rather than seeing it as negative, say, "This is exciting. I get to share my point of view. I get to demonstrate my value." And in so doing by seeing it as more positive, it causes us by definition to relax. And her research fascinatingly found that people actually were perceived as communicating better. And again that's because that pressure was taken off of them. So I challenge everybody to think about what are the exciting elements of the communication opportunities you have and really lean into those. And when you feel those anxiety symptoms, remind yourself these are signs of excitement. This is me being excited about sharing this information and it can really help.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
This is another one I've done and it super works. It sounds so trivial and so like, "Why would this do anything?" But I find you just say that just like, "I'm going to have so much fun. This is going to be exciting." It does make an impact. So another one to try, even though it sounds really trivial.

(00:16:12):
Kind of along these lines, there's another technique you recommend which is a mantra, having a mantra that you repeat to yourself. I don't know if it's kind of the same general idea, but you have a couple mantras that you recommend to people like "I have value to add" and things like that. What advice do you have there?

Matt Abrahams (00:16:27):
Yes, thank you. And that's mine. The one that you shared is, "I have value to add." So if we were to really listen to the voice in our heads when it comes to communication, we say a lot of negative things to ourselves. We say things like, "I'm not prepared. I'm not going to be as good as this person. I'm an imposter." We carry around with us a lot of this chatter that actually sets us up to not do well or to be more nervous. So if we can actually change that talk track, it can help us.

(00:17:01):
I'm not saying you have to go to an extreme and say, "I'm going to be the best communicator ever." Rather you can simply say as I do and as you alluded to. What I'll say right before I speak is, "I have value to bring."

(00:17:12):
Often when we are in communicative situations, especially at work, people want to hear from us. We've been invited to speak, we're on the agenda for the meeting. There is value people can take from our communication and we just have to remind ourselves of that. So having some little mantra that you can say that's not over the top but just makes sense. It could be as simple as you've got this, or I'm prepared, or I know my stuff. And I actually encourage people to write it on a post-it note if you're old school, sometimes people put it into their phones as a reminder. So like a minute or two minutes before they're set to give the presentation or participate in the meeting, it flashes up. We just have to turn off or turn down the noise of that internal negative self-talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
What are some other mantras that you found helpful or that people use?

Matt Abrahams (00:18:03):
They're very personal to different people. I was just coaching a senior leader the other day who his mantra was, "Last time this went well." He's a leader, he does a lot of the same presentations and just by saying last time this went well, reminds him that it's likely to go well this time. We are very susceptible to catastrophizing when we're very nervous about things, especially when we're exposed in front of people. Not in the Brady Bunch exposure we talked about earlier, but when we're out there speaking or communicating and simply reminding ourselves that often they go very well is helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):
Yeah. There's another one that I think you shared which is, "It's not about me, it's about my content."

Matt Abrahams (00:18:41):
Yes, exactly. That's another one. That's a great one. It can be very helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
The one you shared about, "I've got this," reminds me, my wife took a course with the Artist's Way writer, Julia Cameron I think is her name. And she has this piece of advice where you name your critic, your inner critic that's always telling you to stop doing stuff. You name him or her. So I name mine Jim. And then when he or she is giving you things you don't want to hear, you're just like, "Jim, I got this. Jim, I don't need this advice."

Matt Abrahams (00:19:11):
There is a lot of evidence on personifying the things that challenge us and then having conversations with it. It's a way of rationalizing some of the things that we do that are quite negative. So something there for sure to be thinking about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:30):
There we go. Bonus advice. That was-

Matt Abrahams (00:19:32):
Bonus advice, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
I didn't expect that.

Matt Abrahams (00:19:34):
And the cool thing that what you're highlighting is there is a lot of advice out there on how to manage anxiety. Many of us feel like we're the only people who feel this nervous because we see our colleagues, our friends or Ted talks as you were talking about, and we see these people communicating just so effortlessly. Often a lot of work went into that and we don't see that work. And sometimes just knowing that others experience it makes us feel better.

(00:19:58):
If you'll allow me, I'll tell this very quick story. I was in the San Francisco Airport, this was several years ago after my Speaking Up Without Freaking Out book came out, and my name was called over the PA system at the airport counter. The seat that I was supposed to sit in was broken and they wanted to talk to me about it. So when I came away from that, somebody came up to me and said, "Hey, you're the guy that wrote that book on speaking anxiety." I said, "Yes." And I said, "What do you know about it?" He goes, "Oh, I bought the book." I said, "Oh, was it helpful?" He says, "Incredibly helpful, but I didn't read it." I'm like, "This is weird. So you're telling me the book was helpful and you didn't read it?" And so I said, "Tell me more." And he said, "Just knowing that a book like that existed made me feel better because I don't know you and I know you certainly didn't write the book for me. So it implies that lots of people have this issue."

(00:20:44):
And just by normalizing the anxiety, which by the way is the normal condition. Those of us who study this believe it is innate to being human to feel nervous communicating in front of others. So sometimes just reminding yourself that you're not alone and that others have it can actually help reduce the pressure that we feel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
This is such an important point that I am kicking myself for not starting with this also because I think this is something people don't realize. They see all their execs at their company speaking incredibly well, so confidently, so articulately and just like, "Oh my God, how will I ever be someone like that?" Is there anything more you can share of just like you have tons of students that go through your class, you see these issues, they're more transparent, you think about their challenges, I imagine. Is there anything more you could share there to help people feel better? Like this is most people, even when you see someone amazing at speaking, they are also probably nervous.

Matt Abrahams (00:21:36):
With regard to that, I think we just need to talk about it more. We need to share about it. I mean, I always will share that I still have anxiety in speaking in certain situations and it's something that's taken me a long time to work on. I also help people understand that it's not a light switch. It's not like you either have it or you don't. It's a process. And so the idea is over time, we will feel less nervous if we apply some of these principles you and I are talking about.

(00:22:01):
A great technique to help people that often isn't talked about is many of us feel much more comfortable in conversation than we do in presenting. And conversation is a back and forth. So you can actually set up a lot of your communication situations, a presentation, a meeting, et cetera, as conversations. And you don't even have to have a conversation with the audience. You can simply have it with yourself. For example, what would it be like if you were to start a presentation by saying, "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is..." And you state the question and then you answer it. I am actually having a conversation with myself in that moment where I am asking myself a question. I happen to know the answer, I give the answer. This again, just like the reframing as excitement versus anxiety, this is a reframe. I'm not presenting, I'm having a conversation. And in so doing it ratchets down that anxiety.

(00:22:53):
So we need to talk about it. We need to share our experiences with developing anxiety management plans. We realize it's not binary, it's not I have it or I don't. And we start seeing where we feel more comfortable and how can we bring that comfort level into the types of situations that make us nervous, like simply having a conversation with yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:13):
You have another technique I think that's different, maybe it's exactly the same, which is to ask a question of somebody else as you're talking, which is I think deflects attention from you. Can you talk about that?

Matt Abrahams (00:23:22):
Yeah. So we talked about the way we desensitize through visualization. The other thing we can do is distract.

(00:23:30):
I coached a very senior leader at Google who got very nervous when he was up in front of people, and what we did is we distract his audience. So he would start every single presentation saying these words, "Good morning, let's watch this video." And he'd show a 30-second video that was on topic about something they were going to talk about in the meeting. And when the video stopped, he would then facilitate a discussion of what that video was about and then he would ease into his content. So he went from being a presenter to being a facilitator or somebody who was having a conversation with the audience. That made him feel so much better.

(00:24:05):
And so all of us can do things that can distract our audience. Now when I say distract, I don't mean take them on a tangent that's not relevant to what you're saying, but maybe you ask them a question, maybe you tell them a story, maybe you show them a video or ask them to read something. So there are lots of things that you can do that will help get the attention off you for just a little bit so that you can then focus on what works for you or take that deep breath that'll help calm you down. All of these are very useful techniques.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:35):
Yeah, it's interesting once you start talking, it's okay usually. It's the beginning part that you need [inaudible 00:24:40].

Matt Abrahams (00:24:40):
Yeah, most people are most nervous one minute before speaking and the first minute of speaking. And if you can find ways to get yourself through that, then it becomes much easier for most people. There are some people who that's not true for, but for most people that's the way it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):
Awesome. Okay, next technique that actually another guest mentioned, and we spent a bunch of time on this, a guest named Johnny Miller, which is a breathing technique. And just to give a little context from what he taught us is that 80% of our neurons go from our body to our brain versus 20% is our brain telling our body what to feel. And so this research shows that what our body's feeling is what our brain's going to think. So if our body's acting nervous, we're going to think, oh, we're nervous. And if you change the state of your body, your mind feels different.

Matt Abrahams (00:25:23):
I love this stuff. This research, embodied cognition is what it's called, is fascinating to me. I'll share one of my most favorite studies in this. There was a researcher at Duke, I think it was Duke, who... The only experimental variation that he did is he had people hold something that was cold in their hand, like an iced coffee versus a warm coffee. And then he asked the participants to make ratings of people. And if you were holding something cold, you saw the person as a colder person, as more aloof and more distant, and if you were holding something warm, you saw them as more collaborative and embracing. I find this stuff fascinating. What our body feels, our minds think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
Awesome. So along those lines, there's a technique that you recommend that he recommended, but I think it's a great reminder of the double exhale where you breathe in and then you exhale twice as long. Can you talk about that and tell people about it?

Matt Abrahams (00:26:13):
Yeah. Breathing is very helpful in managing so many of our anxiety symptoms. It slows down the heart rate, makes our voice sound more normal because when we get nervous, we breathe shallow and that changes... Our voice is a wind instrument, it changes the way we sound, can reduce some of the shakiness. So deep belly breathing, the kind you do if you've ever done yoga or tai chi, qigong, really important to do and there are a whole bunch of variations on it. The one you're talking about is the double inhalation where you're taking an inhale in until you feel completely full and then you sneak in a little extra air and then you take a long exhale. People call it box breathing and other types of breathing.

(00:26:54):
The bottom line is this, what's critical to the relaxation response is the exhale. Lots of ways to inhale, lots of ways to exhale. You want your exhale to be longer than the inhale. The magic of the relaxation happens during the exhale. So I have a rule of thumb, I jokingly call it a rule of lung. You want your exhale to be twice as long as your inhale. So if you take a three count in, even if you sneak in a little extra air as we were talking about, take a six count out. And it is that way that you will feel... Not only will your body physiologically feel less stress, you'll be more focused in a present moment and not catastrophizing about all the things that might happen in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:36):
Great. Yeah, so it's like another example of this sounds so trivial and why would breathing differently do have any impact on my nervousness? But one, there's all this research that shows that it does, and two, if you try it, and this is another one I use, is it actually works very quickly and you do it a few times and like, wow, I feel really different.

Matt Abrahams (00:27:54):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:55):
It is interesting you put these together. From the way I've seen it, these are two different techniques, but I've never tried them together. One is... I think Huberman is big on this one. All his clips are always talking about this. One of you inhale fully and then you inhale a little bit more and there's some capillaries or something in your lungs that fill up that-

Matt Abrahams (00:28:12):
[inaudible 00:28:12]. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:13):
And then there's the 4, 4, 8 is the way this other guest shared is like breathe in four seconds, hold it four seconds, breathe out for eight seconds. But I'm going to try both. Wow. That's going to double up my calmness.

Matt Abrahams (00:28:27):
You'll be so mellow, nothing will bother you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:29):
So mellow. Okay. Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:28:39):
Well, so the first book had 50 techniques and not all 50 techniques work for everybody. One that I personally think is a lot of fun is getting present oriented because when I'm in the present, by definition I'm not worried about the future. And many of our anxiety comes from our fear of a potential negative future outcome like, "I'm not going to achieve my goal." So if I can do anything to be in the present moment, that helps me out a lot.

(00:29:02):
Something I do as part of my personal anxiety management plan is I say tongue twisters. Tongue twisters for me are a great way to get present oriented. You can't say it right if you don't say the tongue twister if you're not focused on the present moment. And it also warms up your voice. A lot of nervous speakers get so inside their head that they don't warm up their voice. And we all know if you've ever done any exercise or competed in any sports, you should warm up first. We have this mistaken notion that we can go from silence to brilliance without warming up. And I like saying tongue twisters out loud to get present oriented and to warm up my voice. So that's one that I often recommend. People think it's silly, but I have people who are like, that really works. It really helps me to get centered and to warm up. And so I like that one a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):
Well, let's share a couple of tongue twisters. What are some recommendations?

Matt Abrahams (00:29:50):
I will only share my tongue twister, I say Lenny, if you promise to say it after me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Absolutely. I'm so ready.

Matt Abrahams (00:29:55):
This is my favorite tongue twister. It takes five seconds to say, it's three phrases long. And if you say it wrong, you say a naughty word. So I'm going to be listening as for all your listeners. So are you prepared? So it goes as follows, I slit a sheet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):
I slit a sheet.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:11):
A sheet I slit

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):
A sheet I slit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:14):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:18):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:20):
Very good. You didn't say that naughty word. I'm sure you can imagine what it would've been.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
A lot of danger, a lot of [inaudible 00:30:26].

Matt Abrahams (00:30:26):
A lot of danger. But in that moment you weren't thinking about, what's the next question I'm going to ask Matt? Or how much longer do we have in the podcast? No, you were simply focused on what we were saying and trying to say it without saying a naughty word. So that's that [inaudible 00:30:39]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:38):
And not have to censor this podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:42):
I've only had to bleep one guest in all my years of doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:46):
Okay, cool. We're going to link to that. Is there any other ones you want to share before we move on to getting better at speaking on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (00:30:52):
Well, the last one I'll say is, and this one is another one that falls in the kind of funny category, but there's research that says that when you swear, curse, it actually helps you reduce anxiety. When you curse, you release a flood of neurochemicals that blunt out the neurochemicals associated with anxiety, cortisol being a big one. So you get a big dopamine hit, for example, serotonin when you swear. So I'm not saying get up on stage and drop an F-bomb, but my students love this. I mean, it's like, "Matt's giving me permission to swear." And no, that's not what I'm doing, but it's an interesting technique that seems to help some people is to curse not necessarily in front of people, but that can help. And it also has an analgesic effect. It actually reduces pain as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):
That's interesting. I could see during birth women screaming curse words.

Matt Abrahams (00:31:48):
Yeah. Well, I'm not going to say what I heard when my kids were born, but...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
But again, this could double up with the tongue twister where you just go for it and say-

Matt Abrahams (00:31:58):
Yeah, every tongue twister has to start with Nantucket and then we're good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):

(00:33:34):
Okay, let's shift to talking about talking on the spot.

Matt Abrahams (00:33:39):
I see you said shift very carefully. I appreciate that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):
Now we're going to be so, so careful, I don't want this podcast flagged and for adults only. Okay, shift to a new topic. You have a whole book about how to get better speaking on the spot. And I think why this is important is again, what I said at the beginning that I think most of our "public speaking" is not planned public speaking. There's people asking for feedback in a meeting, people wanting you to give a toast, Q&A as we talked about. So what I want to do is you have advice for broadly getting better at these things and then you have advice for very specifically how to get better at giving better toast, doing better Q&A, getting better at small talk and things like that. So I want to start with the broad advice and then get into each of these. That sound good?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:27):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):
How about you share your favorite techniques for broadly getting better at speaking on the spot, and then we'll see where that goes?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:37):
Sure. So the first thing in helping yourself feel better, speaking spontaneously, which is the vast majority of our communication, the plan presenting, the practiced pitch, the meeting with agenda pale in comparison to the times that we are spontaneously speaking. And the first thing that is important for everybody to know is we can all get better at it. That's the fundamental bottom line. Many of us feel like we're either born with the gift of gab or we're not. And so the first thing we have to realize is we can get better at it.

(00:35:08):
The second big point to make is you actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but it is through preparation that we get better at it. And if you think about it, if you think about an athlete, when an athlete is doing their sport, they are being spontaneous, they are responding to the conditions that present themselves to them. What helps them do well is all the preparation and practice that they've done. So there are lots of analogs to this, but when we think about it in of communication, it seems foreign, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice. Those are the two big underlying principles to helping people get better.

(00:35:48):
The next level has to do with we have to attack both mindset and approach and the actual messaging itself. The only way I have found to help people get better at this is to look at how we approach it, our mindset, and then how we actually craft the messages through structure and focus that help us be better. So that's the gradual process from the broadest level about how we have to go about making this better for ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Maybe let's dig into the structure.

Matt Abrahams (00:36:17):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:17):
What is your advice for how to think about structuring if you're on the spot, like, "Oh, shit, how do I share something smart [inaudible 00:36:22]?"

Matt Abrahams (00:36:22):
See, the bad word came out, so you're ready for my tongue twister. So structure is critical. In spontaneous speaking, most of us, because we feel the intense pressure, the anxiety we just talked about, we just spew out information, we list and itemize information. We take our audience on the journey of our own discovery of what we want to say as we're saying it, and our brains are not wired for lists of information. In fact, Lenny, how many items do you need to buy from the grocery store before you actually have to physically write it down? For me it's four. Anything over four, I'm going to forget something. Our brains aren't wired for lists, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
Yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:03):
And so-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
I text myself.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:05):
Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah, no, I'm old school. I actually put it on a piece of paper, but the point is that we're not wired that way. Our brains are actually wired for story, for connection, a logical connection of ideas. So it's about connecting those pieces together. So a structure is nothing more than a beginning, a middle, and an end. A package of information. The structure that almost everybody listening in is familiar with is one that comes from the world of advertising. Most advertisements are set up as problem, solution, benefit. There's some problem in the world, here's how we solve it with our product or service, and here's how you benefit from it. That's a structure. It's a logical beginning, middle, and end. These items have a connection. So by finding a structure that you can rely on when put on the spot, it halves your burden.

(00:37:54):
When you're put on the spot, you have to think about what to say and how to say it. The structure tells you how to say it, and then you just have to think about what to put into it. So it's like having a recipe. If I have a recipe and I have good ingredients, I can cook a good meal. So there are lots of structures.

(00:38:10):
The whole second part of the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is specific structures for specific situations, introducing yourself, making an apology, giving feedback. And I'm not saying every time you give an apology or give feedback that you have to follow these structures. It just gives you a place to go when you're in that moment where you're like, "Where do I go? How do I start?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):
Cool. So we're going to talk about those examples. One of the structures that I liked that I wrote down is called prep, which is make your point, give a reason for making that point, give an example. And then what's the last one point again?

Matt Abrahams (00:38:47):
Yeah, restate your point. Review it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:48):
Restate your point. That feels like something that say in product teams can come up a lot is just like, here's what I think, here's why. Here's an example and then let me just remind you again what the point I'm making.

Matt Abrahams (00:38:57):
That's right. Yes. I love prep and the structure I really like is a three-question structure: What? So what? Now what? And people on product teams I think could benefit so much from this. What is your product, your service, your offering, your update, your feedback? It's the what of why you're speaking. The so what is why is this important and relevant to the people you're talking to or to your company or to prospective clients? And then the now what is what comes next. So on a product team, if you're describing a feature, here's what the feature is, here's why it's important, and here's what we're doing about it. If you're giving an update in an update meeting, a standup that you're having, here's what I'm working on, here's why it's important, here's what I'm doing next.

(00:39:41):
By packaging the information up in what, so what, now what, it becomes much more digestible, much more memorable. Just like prep. Prep works really well for a point you're making. What, so what, now what works really well for a broader presentation, update, feedback session that you're giving. So having a whole series of these tools in your toolkit can really make a difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
So we've talked about three structures so far. What, so what, now what; prep, which is make the point, give a reason example, and then restate the point; and then problem, solution benefit. So people listening to this it's like, "Oh, amazing, all these structures are great." Do you have any advice on how to remember these? You're like, "Oh, Matt, what do you think of this design?" Like, "Oh, shit, which one should I go with?"

Matt Abrahams (00:40:28):
I try to give each structure a catchy name. What, so what, now what rolls off the tongue. There's a structure in the book for giving feedback called 4Is for Apologizing AAA. So part of it is just coming up with a mnemonic that works for you and you can name them whatever you want, but really the way to get familiar with them and to have them at the ready is to use them.

(00:40:48):
When I coach people on what, so what, now what, I encourage them at the end of a podcast they listen to or something they read, take a moment and say, "What was it about? Why is it important to me and what can I do with that information?" And if you do that, not only do you get better and more comfortable deploying that structure, but you also remember the material better because there's a whole bunch of research that says when we interrogate the material that we listen to or read, we digest it and remember it more. So in 30 seconds you're really helping yourself at least in two ways by getting the structure down and remembering more. So you have to put it into practice.

(00:41:24):
The other way to do it in which we do a lot in my classroom is we have people dissect communication. So you listen to somebody or you see it and you say, what structure did they use? So it's about awareness building and then actually getting the reps. The only way you get better at communication, spontaneous or planned, is the way you get better at anything. Repetition, reflection, and feedback. You got to practice, you got to think about what worked or what didn't, and then you have to get feedback from others. We are not always the best judges of our communication. And in so doing, repetition, reflection and feedback takes your communication to the next level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
That's a lot of work, Matt. That's a lot of work.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:02):
It is work. There is no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:04):
Got you.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:05):
But that's true with most things in life that are really important. There's no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
That's right. That's right. As people are thinking about this and listening to this, there's your course, obviously that you teach at Stanford and only Stanford students can take that. There's your book obviously. Is there anything else? If there's nothing, that's totally fine, that you point people to to actually practice these outside of the workplace? Are there courses that anyone can take that you recommend? Anything else you can point people to?

Matt Abrahams (00:42:31):
Absolutely. There are a lot of resources out there. One, I'm a huge proponent and a former member of Toastmasters. I think Toastmasters is a wonderful organization designed primarily to give you the reps. They do some teaching, but it's really to give you the reps. So I highly recommend Toastmasters.

(00:42:48):
Improvisation is another way to get comfortable with these skills. When people hear improv, they think, "Oh, I got to be funny and it's about performing," and it's not. Improv is really just about being more comfortable, being present, and really focusing on collaborating with others.

(00:43:04):
And then there are courses. You mentioned obviously that people have to be MBA students to take my MBA class, but Stanford and other institutions have continuing studies classes or extension classes that are open to the community. So I, every quarter teach a class that's open to anybody who registers all over the world. It's virtual. I have students this very quarter who take a class on a Monday night Pacific Time, 7:00 PM. I've got somebody in Egypt, I have somebody in China. So there are ways to take advantage of things happening at universities without being an enrolled student. So I would point people to all of those. And then clearly listening to podcasts, reading books, checking out blogs and videos can be really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:44):
I think to your point, it's like you can read about this and listen to podcasts all you want, but you're not going to actually get that much better. And with your course, I imagine there's practice you're doing as a part of the course.

Matt Abrahams (00:43:53):
Everything is applied. The only way to get better at communication is to do communication, to watch communication. And that's why in the books I write, I have this, try this. It's literally put the book down, go do this and then come back because that's how you learn communication. And so yes, any avenue to help you get the reps is going to be helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
I'll be honest, I did none of the try this. I'm just like, that's too much work. So I think that's why it's important to take something where you have to do it because it's too easy just like, yeah, yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:24):
Yeah. You're not the first person to say that they don't take the time to do that. There are others who say they really appreciate that. And for people such as yourself, at the very end of my book, I have a QR code that takes you to a bunch of videos. So if you don't want to do it yourself, you can actually watch people do it or watch me do it. And so that's at least better than not doing any of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):
Awesome. I'll also give a shout-out to Toastmasters. I did Toastmasters for a while and two things there. One is there's a special focus on the spot speaking that's a part of the sequence.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:56):
They call them table topics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):
Table topics, yeah. And that's like a 60-second, someone gets up and just has to talk on something. So it's a big part of that method. Also, I did it for a long time and all I did was I was the counter or the timer. You can do it without having to give any talks for as long as you want. And it's very cheap and they're everywhere. There's a local chapter wherever you are.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:17):
Absolutely. And many companies sponsor their own Toastmasters groups, so that's great. And they are very good at easing people into it. You're not forced to do anything. And the same is with improv. A good improv teacher never forces anybody to do anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):
Great. We went way off-topic, but let's get back to the agenda at hand, which is let's talk about specific situations and advice you have for getting better at these. So maybe we start with small talk and there's one that I love and I find so important and so subtle, which is have comparable levels of disclosure. And the question basically is how do we get better at small talk? And here's one technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:55):
Yeah, so let me get to that point in a second because that's a more refined point than some general principles. When it comes to small talk, many people dread small talk, they feel really awkward about it. I think small talk has a bad reputation, needs to be rebranded. I think a lot of big things happen in small talk. We learn about ourselves and others. We form and foster relationships. I challenge everybody listening to think about some of their friends, our closest friends. How did you meet them? Probably some component of small talk played a role, especially early in those relationships. So it does good things for us.

(00:46:32):
The best advice I have ever heard for small talk came from a guest on my podcast. Her name's Rachel Greenwald. She's an interesting person. She's an academic and a matchmaker, really fascinating. And her advice was this: Be interested, not interesting. Many of us go into small talk thinking we have to be super interesting. We have to spike the ball over the net every time. When in fact small talk is more like playing the game of Hacky Sack, where it's simply just set the other person up to be successful and get the ball back to you. So if we go in with that mindset, it makes it easier.

(00:47:06):
Now there's some rules that we can follow. One rule is the one that you shared that in small talk there should be a balance of disclosure or depth of disclosure over time. So if you're telling me about the first time your first pet died, and I'm telling you my favorite color is blue, there's a discrepancy in disclosure there. Clearly you've revealed a lot more than I have. And we have this notion of reciprocity that if you share something that is appropriate but is more disclosive, that I should at some point match that level or come close. And if we don't, then it feels very awkward and we feel like we're not jiving in that way.

(00:47:49):
I don't want everybody sitting with a little card that they're checking off, but having that general notion in mind can help. And the trick here is not to be too disclosive too quickly. So if we start small talk and we're talking about the I meeting that we're at, and you immediately jump into the fight you had with your significant other that might lead to divorce, that's a deep and big step that might feel a little inappropriate. But over time, if we continue to disclose, it might be perfectly natural for you to share that. So there's sort of expectations and we just have to be mindful of those.

(00:48:24):
Another thing we need to be mindful of that I think is really important is this distinction between shifting and supporting responses. In a conversation, I can be supportive. That is, you might say, "Hey Matt, I just got back from Costa Rica." I could say, "Oh great, did you spend time in San Jose? Did you get to any of the beaches?" Those are supporting responses. I'm asking you to keep telling me more. A shifting response would be like, "Oh, you went to Costa Rica. I went to Hawaii." And the goal in a good conversation is to have more supporting responses than shifting, but to have some shifting responses. Because if all I do is continually support you, it looks like I don't want to share. I'm not being disclosive at all. So there are these subtle things that we can be aware of to help the conversation go and to breed that intimacy and immediacy that we feel, but it takes a congruence, a balancing of doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
This is awesome. I feel like everyone needs this class to just like, how do I talk to people? What's the right way to talk?

Matt Abrahams (00:49:24):
Well, right. The point that you're bringing up there, Lenny, is we're never taught this stuff and yet we have to do it all the time. And that's why focusing on it I think really matters. And it can really, as you said, superpower, it can be a superpower because so many people don't do this or spend the time getting better at it. We all operate under this notion of... the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. And that's not good for small talk and other communication situations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):
I love this balance you just shared of... So the primary piece of advice for small talk is be interested, not interesting, ask person questions, get excited about what they're telling you. There's a classic book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, which is very much about this. Highly recommend it. It's like very old school now, but there's so much good advice there. There's no better sound to someone's ears than their name. So just saying their name, they're like, "Yeah, I love that." And then just smiling. There's all these very simple things that that book shares. It sounds like you recommend and you're fan of that book, and it's something you've read, right?

Matt Abrahams (00:50:27):
I know the book. Some of that stuff has been true for a long time. Some of the stuff. I'm not a big fan of ingratiation and manipulation. I like authenticity and some of the advice in books like that can sound like smile, nod your head. And all of that can sound a little manipulative and inauthentic, but I think some of those principles are important. And if you can in an authentic, true, appropriate way, leverage some of that, I think it would help you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:57):
Yeah, somebody once shared a story with their kid... Then they're 13. They read that book and it just effed them up for a while because they just started putting these into practice way too young.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:06):
Well, one thing... I mean, all of a sudden you're focusing on... You can get so wrapped up in doing these things that you're actually not connecting. It's like people who travel on a vacation and all they do is take pictures of where they are instead of experiencing where they are. And that's not where we want to be with this advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
But I love this other component of... Because a lot of people hear this advice, ask questions, be interested, be excited, this version of it, but you need to have somewhat equal levels of disclosure is really important. Because I fall into this sometimes where like, "I don't care about myself. I just want to ask you questions. And this is going great, I'm just going to keep asking." And if you're not sharing anything by yourself, it gets really strange. Even when they ask you, you're like, "No, no, let's keep talking about you." You think they want that, but they don't. They actually want to hear about you.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And you do such a lovely job as a podcast... I mean, so podcast host is a great job for you if you like asking questions, but I bet you have found, because I have found this for me as being a host of Think Fast, Talk Smart is that sharing a little bit about your own experience actually makes the conversations go better. And so I think that's a lesson for all of us, and you don't have to have your own podcast to learn that lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:16):
Yeah, I read this book on podcasting interviewing when I first started, and one of the big piece of advice is if you share more about yourself, you'll hear more stories that they can share. They're more vulnerable. Not that I think about that, but that's in my head sometimes.

Matt Abrahams (00:52:29):
Yeah. Well, you do a good job of it, even if it's just intuitive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):
Appreciate it.

(00:52:33):
Let's talk about another version of on-the-spot talking, which is giving feedback. Oftentimes people listening to this podcast, they're asked, what do you think of this design? What do you think of this roadmap? What do you think of the strategy? What are some tips for getting better at on-the-spot feedback?

Matt Abrahams (00:52:48):
First and foremost, we need to look at and define feedback. Feedback to me is an opportunity to problem solve. Certainly there are some behaviors that we absolutely have to shut down. It's inappropriate, it's inexcusable, we have to shut it down. But often feedback is really an opportunity to problem solve. And if you take it as an opportunity to problem solve, then what you're looking for is collaboration with the other person, which means that we have to invite them to join us as we do this. So it's not me bestowing upon you my opinion, it's me inviting you to together work on whatever this issue challenge is that we have. And I am a huge disciple of Kim Scott, Radical Candor. I really like her approach to it. Kim's a friend. She's actually a neighbor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
Well, she's been on the podcast, by the way.

Matt Abrahams (00:53:35):
Oh, great. So you know Kim and your listeners know Kim. Yeah, she's great. Where I think I can add a little value to what Kim talks about, and she does talk about structure, but I think having the structure to package up the information to make it easier to digest by your audience, the person or people you're talking to, but also to formulate your thoughts can help. And we've already talked about one mechanism, one structure for feedback. It's what, so what, now what?

(00:53:59):
So imagine, Lenny, you and I come out of a meeting and you say, "Hey, Matt, how'd that go?" I could say, "I thought the meeting went really well, Lenny, except when you talked about the implementation plan. You spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail." That's my what. "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." That's the so what. "Next time I suggest you slow down and you include these two or three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area." So that's the now what.

(00:54:32):
So that what, so what, now what helps me very quickly structure information and package it in a way that helps me as the giver of the feedback, think through what are the things I need to say? I need to think through what's bothering me, what the consequences are of that behavior, and then what I think you should do.

(00:54:51):
There's a more robust structure I talk about in the book called The 4 Is, and each I stands for something starting with the letter I. But four eyes also like glasses. It helps you see more clearly. So in the 4 I structure, the first I is information. You're just setting the playing field so the person knows what you're giving the feedback about. The second is impact, and this is impact on you, the feedback giver. The third is the invitation that you make, and then the final is the implications or consequences.

(00:55:19):
So imagine I have an employee who doesn't show up to the meetings on time and prepared. I might say, "This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting. I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are. What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project." So information, impact, invitation, and implications. Now, certainly I can vary the tone and the directness of some of those responses so it sounds very differently, but thinking through it in my mind, I have to level set what we're talking about. I have to share why it's important to me at least, make the invitation, and talk about the benefits or consequences. Makes a lot of sense. So there are lots of structures and lots of ways to communicate, especially in feedback. Find one or two that work for you so when you're put on the spot, you can default to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):
Maybe a big takeaway here is pick one of these structures that you want to use when somebody asks you for feedback. And the two you shared are what? So what? Now what? Or these four Is. Give information, show the impact that it had on you, invitation and then implications.

Matt Abrahams (00:56:30):
That's correct, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Okay. Let's talk about another category, which is not a work category, but I suck at toasts and I am always trying to get better at this. And you have a bunch of awesome advice for how to give better toasts. Can you share some stuff?

Matt Abrahams (00:56:45):
Yeah. We have all been victimized by bad toasts. The toast that goes on too long, the toast that's more about the person giving the toast than the event or the person. And when I say toast, I don't just mean at weddings, bar mitzvahs, quinceaneras. We give tributes at work all the time. Congratulations to the team or somebody's anniversary or somebody's retirement. So we give toasts and tributes all the time. In fact, I heard a statistic once that it is the most frequent public speaking event across people is giving toasts and tributes. So we should learn how to do these well.

(00:57:16):
So I have an acronym. It works. It's called WHAT. W-H-A-T. The W stands for why are we here? Now, if I'm at a wedding, I don't have to tell the audience why we're here. We get it. But if we're doing an all hands and I'm called up to speak, it might be in my best interest to share with everybody, I'm here to celebrate the release of this product that that team put out. So you might have to say, why are we here?

(00:57:42):
The H is how are you connected to the event? So if I'm at a wedding, people might not know who I am. I could say, "Hey, I've known the groom for 25 years." And people are like, "Oh, okay. Now that makes sense." If you're giving a tribute at work, you don't have to say, "And I'm the boss." Everybody knows your position. So again, these are choices you make. So why are we here? How are you connected?

(00:58:02):
The A stands for anecdote. Tell a story or a quick example that is relevant and accessible to everybody. There's no insider knowledge and keep it concise.

(00:58:16):
And then ultimately the last part is the gratitude, the thank you. So express gratitude, express some kind of thanks. In a toast at a celebratory event, you might say cheers or whatever's appropriate for the culture you come from to signal closure. But again, why are we here? How are you connected? Anecdote or two, and then the gratitude or thanking at the end. And if you follow that structure, it can navigate, just like a GPS, your way through the toast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
This is such an easy structure to remember. There's so much of it that I love. What I want to understand is where do you put the actual content of the tribute and the toast? Is it the anecdote expands into, "Here's what I want to say?" Like there's an example or story and then it's like-

Matt Abrahams (00:58:59):
Exactly. So it is typically part of that. You might do it as part of the why we're all here. "We're here to really celebrate the Herculean effort of this particular team to get this product launched. I'm so honored to have supported it. I'm the manager of the team. Here's a story about how Lenny worked overtime to get this done. Let's raise our glasses and give them a salute." So yes, you could do it in the why are we here or through the anecdotes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:29):
Okay. And then one of your other piece of advice, which connects to what you just said is be brief.

Matt Abrahams (00:59:33):
Yes, yes. So nobody has ever complained about a toast that's too brief. I'm sure it's possible, but the majority of complaints are the toast went on forever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
Do you find that it would ever make sense to give a couple anecdotes or make a couple points in a toast?

Matt Abrahams (00:59:51):
Yeah, and it depends. Toasts are opportunities for teaching and learning as well, especially in a work environment. So it might make sense to tell a couple anecdotes. I'm a huge fan... I mean, your listeners know, you know minimally viable product design, agile development, really critical. What is it about? It's about understanding your audience, your users, and it's about rapidly prototyping and iterating. I believe in minimally viable communication, trademark pending, where it's the same principles. Know your audience, put together a rough draft of what you want to say, test it out. So if you're going to give a big toast in front of a company all hands, run it by a few people and say, "Is it too many anecdotes? Would it benefit from having another story?" Get people's feedback. We are not the best judges of our communication. So the answer is yes, but test it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
Another element of a great toast that you recommend is to be emotional. Can you touch on that?

Matt Abrahams (01:00:50):
Well, so emotion connects with people, and as long as it's genuine and authentic, it's really important. I've been thinking a lot about emotion and communication. My father recently passed away and everybody in my family said, "Well, Matt's going to do the eulogy." It was like, I had no choice. What do I do? I'm the guy who teaches communication. So I felt added pressure not only to honor my father's life, but everybody's like, "This is the way you do a eulogy." And so I wanted to do some research on what's all the advice out there on eulogies, and there wasn't a lot. So I actually wrote an article on my experience, and hopefully it'll help people. But the point is, in those circumstances where there's a lot of emotion, it's important because it connects to the audience, it makes it human, but sometimes the emotion can get in the way for you as a communicator. I mean, I was very concerned that my emotion would cover up or overshadow the honoring I was trying to do of my father. But the same thing can happen in any kind of toast situation.

(01:01:48):
So think about emotion. Emotion is a tool to use. The best way to convey emotion in a toast is through the anecdotes you use. The anecdotes reveal the emotion. It's one thing to say, "I am so sad." It's another thing to tell a story that is sad.

(01:02:02):
I was very fortunate to interview for my podcast coming up soon, a one-panel cartoonist. So she has to create everything in one panel. And her advice is: Don't tell, show. In that don't tell somebody you're angry, show that you're angry in the panel she writes. So showing the emotion through story and anecdote is the way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:22):
Have you had Matthew Dix on your podcast?

Matt Abrahams (01:02:26):
So it is so funny. I have not, and I want to. His name comes up more than anybody else's. And I know of his work and his advice, so I might ask you to connect me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):
Absolutely. I thought of him as you were talking because he helps people create their eulogy ahead of time before somebody passes away, before you get really emotional and you have to rush it. So that's one of his services is he helps to write eulogies for people.

Matt Abrahams (01:02:50):
Yeah, yeah. No, I'd love an introduction. His work is very influential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Absolutely. He's amazing. We'll link his episode about storytelling.

(01:02:57):
Okay, let me talk about a couple more. Q&A, getting better at question, answer at the end of a talk, whether it's on the spot or not.

Matt Abrahams (01:03:05):
Again, I always start with approach. Many of us see Q&A as threatening or challenging, and in fact, we need to see Q&A as an opportunity. It's an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, learn. Even in the most hostile of situations where people are really coming at you with a lot of spice or hot and heavy, you can get a lot of value out of it. So we have to come to the approaches. These questions are opportunities. We have to make sure that we take the question in without interrupting or over-validating the question.

(01:03:36):
I have two pet peeves about Q&A sessions. One is saying good question to every question. And two, at the end of answering the question saying, "Does that make sense?" Because in both cases, you're trying to validate the asker when you say good question. You're also trying to buy yourself time. And there are other ways to do that. And at the end when you say, "Does that make sense," you've got a laudable goal in mind, which is, "Did I answer your question?" But I'd much rather you say, "Did I answer your question? Can I tell you more? Do you have a follow-up question?"" Because if you keep saying, "does that make sense, does that make sense," people are going to start thinking, "Maybe he doesn't make sense because he is always asking." So some pet peeves there.

(01:04:15):
Once the question comes in and you have to answer it, I have yet another structure. This structure is related to the what, so what, now what structure. It's called ADD for adding value. You answer the question cleanly and concisely. You then give an example to reinforce the answer, and then you explain the relevance or significance of the answer so people know it. Would you mind role-playing an example of this with me, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:43):
Absolutely.

Matt Abrahams (01:04:44):
Okay. Imagine you're hiring me. You're a hiring manager, and I'm interviewing to be what I do for my day job. I'm a lecturer at Stanford's Business School, teach strategic communication. You so happen to have a position open for a strategic communication lecturer. I show up. What is a reasonable question you would ask that doesn't just have a yes no answer?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):
Wait, so you're interviewing for a role to be a lecturer in my school and [inaudible 01:05:11] communication.

Matt Abrahams (01:05:11):
Yes. You're the dean. You get to hire me. What's a reasonable question? I mean, you could ask a super hard one, but I want people to hear how ADD works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):
This might be too simple, but just how many students have you worked with and taught over the years?

Matt Abrahams (01:05:23):
Okay, so I'm going to morph that question because I could just say thousands, which is true, but I'm going to turn it into a question about experience, because really what you're asking me is what's my experience? So because that I can give an ADD answer too. If it's just a numeric answer, just give a number. So I might say, "I've been doing this for 25 years and I have taught over thousands of students. I've taught both in the academic world, but also in the corporate world. What this means is I can tailor my material to be relevant and useful to your students."

(01:05:56):
So I answered the question. The question was, what's your experience? 25 years, thousands of students. I then give an example. I've done this in the corporate world, I've done this in the academic world. So I ground it in something tangible. And then I show the relevance. What this means for you as a dean hiring me, is that I'm going to be able to tailor my experience. We often assume that people can connect the dots. If I give my answer, you're going to see, "Oh, that's why this is relevant and important." But we need to actually connect those dots for our audience.

(01:06:24):
I had a psychology professor once who said, the funny thing about common sense is it's not so common, and we often make the assumption that people will connect the dots. So answer the question, give a detailed example, and then explain the relevance. And if you do that, it will help. And I challenge every one of your listeners working in companies that have FAQs, frequently asked questions, go back to those FAQs and put them in this structure. Not only will it help you digest and get familiar and comfortable with the structure, anybody looking at those answers begins to see that this is a way to give a complete answer. This is how our organization answers questions. And that can be so helpful to building consistency and helping yourself answer better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):
Just to clarify, the acronym is ADD?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:09):
ADD. Answer, detailed example, describe the relevance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):
Describe the relevance. I see how you snuck that D in there.

Matt Abrahams (01:07:16):
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can come up with whatever acronym you want that helps you remember. ADD because it adds value.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
Awesome. Okay. And maybe one last quick one, apologizing. What's a couple tips for getting better at apologizing on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:33):
First and foremost, we need to take the time to apologize. Many of us don't. And when we apologize, we need to make sure that we apologize for the transgression and not for how we made people feel. So often people will simply say, "I'm sorry that you feel bad." Well, that's not an apology. You're not assuming responsibility. So we need to first start by talking about the issue that we are addressing or the problem that we caused somebody. So we need to think about apologies in that way. So an apology to me, I have a AAA, like roadside repair service here in the United States, AAA. It's three steps, acknowledge, appreciate, and amends. So I have to acknowledge what I did.

(01:08:23):
So imagine we're in a meeting and I interrupted you. You were in the midst of speaking and I interrupted you. So I might say, "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke when you were talking." I'm acknowledging what I did.

(01:08:36):
Then I appreciate. "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view." So that's the appreciation.

(01:08:46):
The amends part is, "I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done, and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point." So I'm signaling I understand it, and here's the very specific thing I'm going to do to try to remedy it, which of course you can comment on. You can say, no, I don't think that's enough. I think you whatever, or thank you, I think that's even more than is needed, whatever. So you acknowledge the actual behavior and offense, not how you made the person feel right away. You then express appreciation for the difficulty you might've caused, and then you make amends. And the AAA approach, I think can really be helpful to people to be better at in-the-moment apologies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:29):
Amazing. Matt, I think we've packed this episode with so many tactical golden nuggets to help people become better communicators, especially on the spot. Is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before I ask you how they can find you online and things like that?

Matt Abrahams (01:09:45):
Again, I want to go back to how we started the second part about spontaneous speaking. Everybody can get better at communication. And I encourage, I challenge people to take the steps that they need to take to do it. So it starts with initiative. It's followed by grace and a lot of compassion, it takes time. But in so doing, you can improve your communication and help others. It's not just about you finding your voice, it's about you sharing that voice with others. So taking the time to work on your communication is critically important, and I encourage everybody to do so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:18):
All right. I'm hoping people will follow that advice. And if not, think back to what we talked about at the beginning of just how much impact these have and how many people are also going through the same challenges you're probably feeling speaking and being on the spot. All right, where can folks find your podcast, your book, and also how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt Abrahams (01:10:37):
Oh, I love that last question. So mattabrahams.com, great place to go to to find things. So at mattabrahams.com you'll find a whole bunch of resources. My own and others. I've curated a bunch of resources. You can find Think Fast, Talk Smart wherever you get podcasts and on YouTube. And then the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is available everywhere. I'm a huge user of LinkedIn. And to answer that last question you asked, I invite people to connect on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear their stories and find ways to collaborate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
Awesome. And your podcast is ranked higher than this podcast. You're in a different category, which is a very competitive category. The business category. I've moved myself to the technology category, which feels more natural to me, but your podcast is killing it, so congrats.

Matt Abrahams (01:11:06):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:21):
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us. That's it. Matt, thank you again for being here.

# The surprising truth about what closes deals: Insights from 2.5m sales conversations | Matt Dixon

## Transcript

Matt Dixon (00:00):
We collected two and a half million sales calls and studied them with a machine learning platform at scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05):
The big insight is that you're losing most of your sales deals, not to competition, but to indecision.

Matt Dixon (00:12):
And that indecision stems from their fear of failure. Dialing up the FOMO backfires 87% of the time. They're not afraid of missing out, they're afraid of messing up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20):
You just talk about how to actually leverage these insights to improve your sales process. You have something, I think you call it the JOLT method?

Matt Dixon (00:25):
Yeah, JOLT them forward. The first thing is we've got to judge their level of indecision. The second thing is we've got to offer a recommendation. The third thing is we've got to get them to start trusting us and we call it limit the exploration, and the T is we've got to de-risk the deal. We've got to take some risk off the table. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38):
Great segue to The Challenger Sale, which is basically this on steroids. 

Matt Dixon (00:41):
Most salespeople are trying to figure out what's keeping the customer up at night. The challenger approach is about showing the customer what should be keeping them up at night. What's a risk that they don't know about but you do. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51):
Holy moly, this is going to be the most action-packed, high-density podcast episode we've done. Today, my guest is Matt Dixon. Matt is one of the world's foremost experts in sales, known for his groundbreaking research into what makes the best salespeople different from everyone else. His first book, The Challenger Sale, was a number one Wall Street Journal bestseller and has sold over a million copies worldwide. His most recent book, The JOLT Effect, builds on his lessons and insights and will change how you do sales. 

(01:23):
In our conversation, Matt breaks down what you're probably doing wrong in your sales process based on research, into millions of sales conversations, and then how to tweak your process to be a lot more successful. This episode is for anyone that wants to improve their sales skills or improve the rate at which they close deals. 

(01:40):
With that, I bring you Matt Dixon and if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Matt Dixon (01:59):
It's great to be here. Thank you for the invitation, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:01):
It's great to have you here. First of all, a huge thank you to April Dunford for connecting us. She's a huge fan of your work. She mentioned you a number of times on the podcast episode that she did. She's great. 

Matt Dixon (02:11):
Yeah, she's very nice. 

Lenny Rachitsky (02:12):
She's amazing. You basically spend your time researching salespeople and digging into what makes the best salespeople different from all the rest, and then synthesizing these lessons into these really actionable pieces of advice so that anyone can become better at sales, which to me feels like a dream come true even if I'm not a salesperson, even though many of us do sales part-time, but especially if you're a salesperson. 

(02:40):
First of all, just to give people a sense of the work that you do, could you just talk a bit about the research that went into the books that we're going to talk about, we're going to be focusing on The Challenger Sale and The JOLT Effect. What is the research they did?

Matt Dixon (02:53):
Yeah, sure. Just start with The Challenger, because that chronologically came first. We actually started that research study in, I think it was in late 2008 actually, and we published the initial results to, at the time I was working for a company called CEB, which was acquired by Gartner Group in 2017, a research organization, and then I was running the group that served heads of sales, business, business heads of sales around the world. We had five or 600 clients around the world, and we launched that study in '08. 

(03:24):
We published the initial results for our clients in '09. We kept collecting some data and then we published the book in 2011. The book was published off a data set of 6,000 salespeople, so we did an in-depth survey with 6,000 salespeople, as well as collected performance data on those 6,000 sellers. It was a global, cross industry, different types of companies as well, product companies, services companies, large, small, slow growth, fast growth, you name it.

(03:50):
Overtime, though, that research has been ongoing, so we've collected data. I think to date, on roughly a quarter million salespeople around the world that we continue to go back and not just validate the original findings, but look at how things are changing and do cuts of the data now that the data set's so big. That was a survey based piece of research we did. 

(04:11):
The JOLT Effect, we started that research in 2020, actually. It was actually in March of 2020, which I think is a time that everybody remembers with probably mixed emotions, most of them bad. I think though, you remember March was a time when people were getting into Tiger King and baking sourdough bread. A few months later, that got really old, but in the beginning it was kind of surprising and weird and this whole pandemic thing, but we actually thought because we're huge nerds, that this would be an interesting time to do a sales research project.

(04:44):
We had always been fascinated by what Professor Neil Rackham did back in the '70s and '80s and spin selling, and he and his research team sat in on 30 something thousand sales calls, physically sat in on these meetings and took notes. They're a team of psychologists to produce the research that went into spin selling, and so we always kind of aspire to get, if you will, at the coal face or where the rubber hits the road in sales, which is the sales conversation when that salesperson is sitting across from the customer. 

(05:11):
The problem with that is it's really hard to get people to pay for that kind of research, that kind of undertaking, and then let alone, getting invited into those meetings because a lot of the really critical sales meetings took place, of course, in the client's office. Until March of 2020 when that all changed and the entire sales process for every company on Earth went to Zoom and Teams and Webex and other virtual platforms.

(05:34):
We recruited several dozen companies across industry and around the world into a large global study, and we collected two and a half million sales calls and studied them with a machine learning platform at scale. That was a very different kind of research project and honestly, it's fun just as a researcher to look back on Challenger and the manual survey-based approach and the interviews and all this stuff to fast forward to today, being able to take advantage of large data sets and advance technology to study millions of sales conversations is pretty cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:07):
Amazing. Okay, so the second book, the most recent book, The JOLT Effect is based on these two and a half million sales conversations. 

Matt Dixon (06:13):
Mm-hmm. That's right.

(08:05):
Let's dive into the insights from The JOLT Effect. The way that I understand is the big insight is that you're losing most of your sales deals not to competition, but to indecision. Basically, customers preferring to do nothing versus choosing something because they are afraid of making a mistake.

Matt Dixon (08:24):
Good summary. Yeah, [inaudible 00:08:25], if you're busy, you said it more succinctly. I've been doing this for a while now and you said it way more succinctly than I can. Just to back up for a little bit, I think one of the data points I always start with when I present the research on The JOLT Effect is that our analysis showed that anywhere between 40 and 60% of the average salesperson's qualified pipelines, these aren't just leads, sometimes bad leads that are thrown over to us by marketing, these are qualified opportunities. 

(08:53):
These are people we've met with, customers we've pursued, we've engaged, they're in the sales process, 40 to 60% of them will be ultimately marked as closed loss, no decision. That's actually, I think that number is actually on the rise, especially in places like SaaS and the broader tech sector over the past year and a half, but that's a really painful thing. 

(09:13):
If you think about as a salesperson, that for 46% of your deals, you're going to spend a lot of time, energy, resources, a lot of your company's money and their time and resources pursuing these opportunities where you eventually just get ghosted and you don't really know what happened, just like the customer, the opportunity evaporated on you, they ghosted you, they want radio silent. You don't really know what happened there. 

(09:35):
We decided to take this two and a half million sales call dataset, which you could have used to answer lots of different questions, but we were really fascinated by this question, maybe two, two questions. One is why do customers make no decision? Because you understand it's frustrating as a salesperson, but it's also puzzling for customers to do that. They go through the entire process to evaluate a solution, and many of those customers say, "Yeah, I want to buy," and then they ghost to the salesperson and it's so puzzling. 

(10:02):
Why would they waste their own time evaluating a solution than doing nothing? Then, the more important question is probably what are the very best salespeople do differently? What have they figured out to avoid that outcome? 

Lenny Rachitsky (10:13):
Cool, and we're going to talk about that latter part to help people understand why, because it sounds like, okay, I guess this happens, but help people understand why this happens. Why are people nervous to make a mistake and not make a decision at all?

Matt Dixon (10:24):
Let me maybe take us a step back, Lenny. There was a reason we actually even asked that question that you just asked, and the reason was this, when we looked at sales calls, if you think of the typical sales process or buying journey, it kind of moves through three phases. Phase number one, is the customer in their status quo. It's what they do today. They use your competitor's product. Maybe they do use a homegrown solution, maybe they never saw a need for a solution like yours, but that's their current state. 

(10:51):
Step two is we've got to get them to agree that the current state is no longer acceptable and they've got to move forward in a new and different way. We call that agreement on a vision. We've got to get their intent to move forward and to change, and that step number three is you got to get them to buy something. That's the action step where they execute the docuSign, they sign on the line that is dotted and they send the contract back. 

(11:11):
It's a simple three step process, and what we found in our analysis is one of the big places where a lot of deals fall out of that process is between intent and action. It's after the point where the customer says, "Yeah, Lenny, this sounds great. I'm sold. Let's talk." But before the point where that actually deal gets sold, a lot of deals kind of go sideways in that moment and the way this comes across in sales calls is that customers start, if you will, relitigating concerns that they had asked and you thought you'd address much earlier, like what might go wrong and is this really the right answer for us? 

(11:45):
These are things that are puzzling to salespeople because it feels like this thing is slipping through my fingers right before my eyes. I thought we had this closed. I thought you said you want to move forward and now you're asking questions that we addressed three months ago, what's going on? 

(11:58):
What salespeople tend to do, because they've grown up in a world where they've been told, the only reason the customer hesitates is because you haven't put to bed their status quo bias. We all know, we're all human beings, not just customers, but perhaps especially customers, are guilty of status quo bias, meaning we are prone to laziness and doing nothing because it's easier, it's inertia. It's easier to just keep doing more of the same than to change behavior. 

(12:23):
Change is really hard and salespeople have been taught that the status quo is their biggest competitor, and if the customer is starting to get cold feet, it's because they still think either what they're doing today is good enough, what you are proposing is not a compelling enough reason to change, or maybe it's just not a top priority for them or their organization. It's got to be one of those reasons. 

(12:43):
What salespeople have been armed to do is go out and dial up the FOMO and make the customer sweat a little bit. The first thing they do is they say, "Lenny, remember the demos and the proof of concept trial, how excited you were and those benefits, you got to pay for it. You're not going to get all those great benefits for your organization unless you sign the agreement." 

(13:03):
If that doesn't work, I'll try to kind of scare you into action by dialing up the fear, uncertainty and doubt and saying, "Lenny, you told me about these problems in your business. You guys are really struggling right now. By the way, did I mentioned, we're working with all of your competitors and they're seeing tremendous benefits from our product and you're going to be left in the dust and those problems you brought up with me, they're not going to solve themselves." 

(13:22):
I'm trying to create that burning platform a little bit for the customer and get them to realize the cost of their inaction. There is a cost of doing nothing, and if those two things don't work, what most salespeople go to is the 10% discount that's only good this quarter. It's like the price driven urgency. Maybe this will be the thing you need to just get you over the finish line. 

(13:43):
What we were so surprised by which led us to the question you asked, Lenny, was that 87% of the time when salespeople do that dial up the FOMO in those moments, especially with a customer who says that they're ready to move forward, but they start to backpedal and waffle and waiver and become hesitant dialing up the FOMO backfires 87% of the time. In other words, it increases the odds, the deal will be lost to no decision.

(14:06):
If it weren't for that finding, we never would've even bothered asking the question about why do people end up, why do we lose deals to no decision, why do customers make no decision, but this was really puzzling because it flew in the face of everything we talked about, including in Challenger, to be totally candid. We talked about how challengers are exceptional at breaking the customer's status quo bias by showing them the pain of same is worse than the pain of change. 

(14:29):
Again, overcoming that inertia, that not just individuals but organizations suffer from. Challengers are really good at that. Here, we see that the tactics that you might associate with challenging actually kind of backfire, which was, as the author of The Challenger, still a little bit troubling to me, but we'll come back to that, but I think what we realized was we got it right, but we got it kind of half right.

(14:50):
We went into the data and we asked a slightly different question, which is why are deals lost in no decision? What drives that? We found that actually, there are a lot of deals that are lost because the customer does actually prefer their status quo. That is status quo bias. They believe what they're going to say is good enough, what you're talking about, it's not a compelling enough reason to change or this is not a top priority. 

(15:11):
Those are all status quo preference reasons, but it turns out those are only 44% of the no decision losses, 56% of no decision losses are customers who want to buy but can't buy because they're stuck in this no man's land of indecision, and that indecision itself stems from their fear of failure, which you put your finger on earlier, and this is the part I found so fascinating, so we dug into the psych research. We read probably 30 years of cognitive psychology journal articles, many of them from Dutch universities, which I find very interesting, but a fairly very big into this stuff. 

(15:49):
A lot of the Kahneman and Tversky work around loss aversion and prospect theory, et cetera, and one of the big findings we came across is that there's actually a more powerful human bias, even more powerful than status quo bias that rears its ugly head and causes indecision, and that is called the omission bias. 

(16:06):
The omission bias is, if you get down to it, is the fact that people don't want to be blamed for making decisions that lead to a loss. In the human mind, there are two types of loss that we think about. We all like to avoid loss, but not all loss is created equal. There are losses that happen when we do nothing, and then there are losses that happened because we did something. 

(16:25):
We made a decision, we picked a vendor, we executed a contract, and then something bad happened. It turns out that in the human mind, people are okay with missing out. They are not okay with messing up and being blamed, and this is really powerful. It's even more powerful than status quo bias, as I said. 

(16:44):
The shorthand for salespeople is this, dialing up the FOMO can be very effective to overcome status quo bias, but knowing that every human being, including all of your customers, who I include in that definition of human beings are definitely afraid of being personally blamed if things go wrong. The FOMU actually matters more than the FOMO. The FOMU is the fear of messing up or in the not safe for work version of your podcast, I'd say FOFU, but your listeners can figure out what that stands for on their own, but this is really powerful for salespeople, right to understand. 

(17:16):
Look, if you are trying to scare your customer into action, you're going to miss out on these benefits. You're going to miss out on solving these problems. You're just going to pay more later if you don't say yes now. What you're really doing is using scare tactics, but you're trying to scare somebody who's already afraid. The problem is they're not afraid of the thing you think they're afraid of. They're not afraid of missing out, they're afraid of messing up. 

(17:36):
We've got to address that as salespeople. We've got to help instill the confidence in the customer that you're making a great decision. I've got your back. You're going to look like a hero, not like a fool and that's really what The JOLT Effect is about. It's about how the very best salespeople execute that. It wasn't that we're wrong with Challenger, it's just the story was kind of incomplete. 

(17:55):
You got to break status quo bias. If you don't do that, you're never going to have an indecision problem, but even once you overcome the customer's indifference and their status quo bias, you got to second battle you've got to fight, which is you've got to instill the confidence and make them feel good about this. Frankly, leap of faith they're about to take and their fear, you got to deal with the fear that if something goes wrong, they're worried that they're going to be blamed for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:16):
We're going to talk about this method you developed for how to actually do all the things you're talking about, but first, to make this even more real, what I'm thinking about is an example. Is a good example, maybe a CRM, like a better CRM product, say someone has Salesforce installed and now they're like, maybe there's probably something better out there we should probably evaluate. 

(18:34):
Then, I'm thinking from the perspective of a startup trying to build a better CRM. There's always this advice, you have to be 10 times better for anyone to pay any attention. I think that feeds into exactly what you're showing is it needs to be so much better that this fear is reduced. Can you just talk about maybe an example, whether it's that one or a different one to make this more concrete?

Matt Dixon (18:52):
We encountered a ton of examples. It's so interesting you mentioned startups and I think sometimes, I was actually with a big enterprise software company and I think when, and I presented this research to some of their sales leaders and one of the folks in the room said, "I'm really glad we are who we are, that we are the 800-pound gorilla, especially in a market like we're in right now," because as the old adage goes, it wasn't IBM, but the old adage is that nobody ever got fired for buying from IBM, right? 

(19:21):
This company is like the IBM of their space. They're the 800-pound gorilla. They've got the brand strength, the reputation, they're the safe choice. This team felt kind of comfortable or comforted, I should say by that fact, especially in a tight environment where it's a battle for deals and for mindshare and for wins out there in the market right now, especially in tech.

(19:42):
What I said is you've got to remember though, that may be true, and I would argue, and I think you're right, that for a startup, yeah, you've got to be 10 times better to get that mind share. It may be even better than that to get somebody to take a leap of faith with you. There is inherent risk in going with the unproven player, but I cautioned these folks and I said, "Now, remember, what are the things that drive fear of failure and indecision?" 

(20:08):
It turns out there are three big ones. The first one is have I made the right choice? I know I want to work with this vendor, but did I configure the solution of the proposal the right way, the right contract length, the right implementation, the right used cases, the right integrations, all that professional services or DIY, all those big questions.

(20:26):
The second thing that customers worry about in their second fear of failure is that they're going to learn something after the contract is signed that's going to make the decision look like not such a great decision. I'll give you a really specific example about this. I spoke to a tech company not too long ago, maybe a month ago, and they landed their biggest deal of their existence. It was an early stage company, seven-figure deal, game changer for this organization. Then, they beat out some big established competitors. This is a huge win. 

(20:54):
They went out. They celebrated. It was just totally amazing, their first big enterprise win and their first seven-figure deal and their first victory against some of these incumbents. Unfortunately, about two weeks after they won this deal, the new Gartner Magic Quadrant on their space came out and they were shown to be kind of, eh, right? They weren't the leader, but they were sort of middle of the pack.

(21:16):
All of a sudden, the client who signed the agreement, the CTO just got crap rained from everybody saying, "Did you see the Gartner Magic Quadrant? It looks like the company we just plunked down seven figures with was kind of seen as so-so by the Gartner analyst? Have we talked to these guys and those guys and why aren't we going with the leaders," and blah, blah, blah? 

(21:36):
They ended up backing out of the contract because the CTO said, "I'm spending every day talking to all the other key stakeholders trying to convince them that yes, we did all of our due diligence, but life is too short and we're probably going to end up going with one of the big players. We're sorry. I mean, that's such a painful story, but that's the customer is like they're going to keep doing research because they don't want to be surprised when some new piece of information comes to light. It's the second big fear of failure driver or failure driver. 

(22:03):
The third one is that the customers are worried they're just not going to see the ROI. They're not going to get the full benefits. You might project for them a 5X improvement in sales productivity. What if it comes in at two or three X and my name's on the agreement and the CFO comes asking why we didn't get the benefits we thought? In today's environment, that's not just egg on your face, you could get fired for that stuff. 

(22:26):
This is the client who's really looking for that vendor to have their back and to assure them that they're going to see the benefits that are being projected and promised through the sale. What I said to this big enterprise tech company was, "Look, you guys, yes, it's tough to be a startup right now, early stage company, there's a lot of risks there, but who's offering more choices, them or you guys? You guys have a partner ecosystem. You have 20 different cloud products. You bought seven companies in the past three years. You have a cornucopia of options, which adds to the buyer's anxiety that they haven't chosen the right thing. 

(22:59):
Second, do you think there's more written about you guys or about them? You could fill a football stadium with all the coverage on you guys. I mean, everybody's got an opinion about you because you are the 800-pound gorilla and everybody's worked with you before and they have opinions, good and bad, and people want to leave no stone unturned. 

(23:17):
Then, lastly, it turns out you guys are a lot more expensive because you're trying to move from selling simple products like these ankle biters out there, these startups into selling big enterprise solutions. You guys are selling not seven-figure deals, eight-figure deals, nine-figure deals to your customers. That increases the customer's anxiety that I really have to see return on this. 

(23:36):
You, in many respects, are getting whipsawed by these factors in a way that the startups are not because they don't have as many choices. There's not as much coverage about that. The investment is lower, and so there's a little bit less risk for the customer. You guys aren't immune just because you're the big brand."

Lenny Rachitsky (23:53):
You're doing a great job making it clear why it's so nerve-racking to buying new software. There's just so many things that could hurt you as a person at a company. April Dunford, I think this is barred from your language that she talks about how it's actually more stressful these days to buy software than to sell software because of all these things you've talked about.

Matt Dixon (24:13):
Yeah, I think she's on point on that one. I mean, your customers are, yeah, they're really, really afraid of this not panning out. It was so interesting, and salespeople can think of so many different occasions where the purchase buying your product, just made all the sense in the world for the customer, it would make things so much better. It would solve such big problems for them. 

(24:37):
They're so dissatisfied with their current approach. It's just a no-brainer, and the customer will look at that and they will agree with you and they still won't make a decision because of the what-ifs, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (24:47):
Yeah. This is got to be very frustrating for founders to listen to and be like, "Come on, our product is so much better. What are you doing?" But I think this explains a lot of the challenges they're probably having.

(26:02):
It's a great segue to talking about how to actually leverage these insights to improve your sales process. You have something, I think you call it the JOLT method?

Matt Dixon (26:10):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:11):
Awesome. Let's get into it.

Matt Dixon (26:12):
The JOLT, it's an acronym. It just so happened it worked out that way, but I like it because it's memorable, but it also speaks to what's happening. Our customers' stuck in their indecisive state. They want to buy from us, but they just can't because worried about what might go wrong. You got to JOLT them forward. We got to JOLT them into action.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:12):
Beautiful. 

Matt Dixon (26:30):
How do we do it? The first thing is we've got to judge their level of indecision, we've got to figure out what we're dealing with. The second thing is we've got to offer a recommendation. The third thing is we've got to get them to stop doing endless research and start trusting us and limiting, we call limit the exploration, and the T is we've got to the derisk the deal. We've got to take some risk off the table, and we establish that safety net for the customer so they feel like we've got their back. 

(26:49):
Maybe we talk about each of those. I'll start with the J because it's first, but also I think the way, while it's kind of linear, I would encourage listeners don't think about this as a process where it's like I do step one, two, three, four, J-O-L-T. Think of it as it starts with the J, and the J tells you what the next step is. Is it the T? Is it the L? Is it the O? Is it the O, and then we got to deal with the T. Then, we got to go back to the O because it comes up again. 

(27:14):
Think of it as sort of the dividing rod. How do we figure out what's got the customer nervous? This is a really, really, really tricky thing because, and I've likened indecision to the carbon monoxide poisoning of sales. It's everywhere, but it's odorless, it's tasteless, but you need a carbon monoxide detector, and that's what the J is. 

(27:37):
How do we get fear of failure on the table? The problem with this is that, and I think most of your listeners will be familiar with this, everybody, especially customers suffers and senior executives especially, especially, suffer from what's called the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is they think they're better at things than they really are and decisiveness is one of those things that buyers will think they will say they think they're decisive. 

(28:00):
In fact, if you surveyed your customers, not that they recommend this, and you add 100 of them, if they consider themselves to be decisive folks, like 99 out of 100 will say, "Absolutely, yes, I make the tough calls. I manage from the gut. I live on the edge as an executive making those big calls," but the research tells a very different story. It turns out that 87% of buyers in our two and a half million sales calls we studied, either showed moderate or high levels of indecision. 

(28:25):
The folks who are not worried about fear or failure were 13%. Yeah, those people do exist. By the way, if you find one of those people, you should sell them everything as soon as possible because they're making the decision quite literally on the dollars and cents and the ROI and whether it makes sense for their business. It's a rational decision for them, but for the rest, they're dealing with a lot of emotion, and that emotion is all wrapped up with fear of failure. 

(28:48):
What's so tough about this is that it's not just Dunning-Kruger like we think we're more decisive than we really are, even if your customer knows that they're indecisive or they're worried about failing or how their boss is going to perceive them, if this purchase doesn't pan out, they don't like talking about it because it's embarrassing. They don't want to talk about like, "God, I got to tell you this better pay off because if it doesn't, I'm already on thin ice with my boss. She doesn't like me already. This is going to be the last straw." Nobody's going to say that stuff. 

(29:17):
How do we get on the table? One of the things we don't think works particularly well are classic open-ended questions like, "Lenny, do you find when you go to the Cheesecake factory, do you leave satisfied or hungry because you can't decide what to order?" I guess, it's not great approaches with customers, you'll end the sale pretty quickly because again, your customers find that kind of offensive. They'd like to think of themselves as decisive people. 

(29:39):
We found a technique, this is actually not in the book, we found it after we wrote the book, called pings and echoes that high performers use. Think of the way a surface ship might detect a submarine in the water using sonar. They send a ping out into the water and they're listening, if you will, using sonar for the reflection back and the reflection tells them, is it a friendly submarine, an enemy submarine? Is it just a whale? Is it heading towards us? Away from us? At what speed are they about to torpedo us? All that good stuff. 

(30:08):
We want to do the same thing in sales. The way this works is that a salesperson will try to articulate but in a non, not to out the customer, but to get confirmation or refutation, if you will, that what they've articulated is actually a concern for their buyer. 

(30:25):
Hypothetically, let's imagine we're talking about a purchase and we've had a lot of great conversations. I've shown you a lot of demos. You guys have liked everything we've shown. We showed you partner options. We showed you different configurations. We did POC over here. We did a pilot over there. You guys are just eating it all up, but I'm kind of getting the sneaking feeling that you guys actually don't know what you want and we've shown you a lot and we've probably made that problem worse. 

(30:49):
What I might say to you is, "Lenny, I'm just curious if we could calibrate here for just a moment, and there's a reason I'm asking this, which is a lot of the customers at this point in our process of working together, they get almost overwhelmed with all the options, and look, I probably made this worse. We're very proud of what we do. I want to show you, paint the art of the possible, but I also know if we're going to do business together, you told me right away budgets are limited and you can't have it all. You've got to decide what's nice to happen and what's need to happen. I'm just curious, are you and your team clear on what would be in and out of the proposal?" 

(31:25):
What's going to happen is one of two things, one you might say, or a few things, you might say, "You know what? No, we don't know and we have liked everything you've shown us, but as you said, we can't have it all. So, we'd be really curious to know what do other companies like us start with? How do we get going? What are the things we can do without and we can maybe add later on down the road," or you might get the customer says, "No, no, no, we were just being polite. There's a lot of stuff you showed us that we're not actually that interested in. It's cool, but it's just not for us. We are very clear on what we want. 

(31:55):
So, let me share that with you now. However, what I'm really concerned about is once we get this kind of specked out and configured and priced, I'm going to take it to the CFO because I've got to get her approval on this and I can't build our business case on the claim you guys make about improving sales productivity by 10% because she'll laugh me out of her office. Help me get grounded in what's a believable outcome for us so that I can sell it and I can be confident we're going to actually hit it." 

(32:25):
Again, it's not designed to embarrass the customer, it's designed to get this on the table so it can be recognized and dealt with and contextualized. You're totally normal. Everybody struggles with this. There's a lot of stuff we throw in front of people and it ends up doing some harm. They don't know what to pick. Let me be of service and value to you. 

(32:42):
That's the first thing that we point to and that's going to tell us, okay, is it a choice problem? They're overwhelmed. They don't know what to choose, like that example we just used. Is it that they're just doing endless research and they feel like they haven't really come down the learning curve yet around this purchase or is it, no, I don't actually know that we're going to get what we're paying for here and we screw this stuff up every day of the week at twice a Sunday and I don't think it's going to be any different and then I'm going to get blamed, so help me manage the downside risk, but it tells us kind of where to go next on that journey, if that makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (33:12):
Yeah. Awesome. The advice there is basically get a sense of how clear they are internally on knowing exactly what they want that'll help them make a decision. There's kind of this moment of, okay, let's just help me understand the question, the way you phrased it, are you and your team clear on what would be in or out of this proposal?

Matt Dixon (33:31):
Yeah. That's just a one example. That's if I hypothesize that you're really struggling with what to choose. Now, my hypothesis might be, you know what you want. You've done plenty of research, but you're really worried about the ROI and you're just worried you just aren't going to be able to accomplish that. 

(33:47):
That ping might sound very different. It might be we've been having a discussion about, you've been asking for multiple terms of the ROI calculation and changing parameters and really trying to make it bulletproof, but a lot of customers struggle with that a little bit because that's a big thing. You're putting your name against that. Maybe we should have a conversation about whether that's a concern for you. Is there a believability gap? Is there an execution gap you're worried about on your side or on our side? 

(34:15):
Let's have a conversation about that so I can set the proper expectations so you feel really confident going to the CFO and lobbying for investment here. That ping could go in, but it's based on what I think is holding you up.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:28):
Got it. It's just like at this point, many customers have this question... 

Matt Dixon (34:32):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:33):
... and that maybe comes from the thing that you think is probably blocking them. 

Matt Dixon (34:36):
Yeah, I think that's perfect language. At this point, most customers like you, are thinking about this or they're worried about that, or they're getting a little anxious about this. Let's have a conversation about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:46):
Awesome. Okay, cool. Let's go to step two, offering your recommendation.

Matt Dixon (34:50):
Sure. Oh yeah. This was right with that example we talked about before. Options are really a double-edged sword. What we know from the research is that options are great early on. If you're meeting at the trade show and the customer's swinging by your booth or you're doing a first demo or first, let a thousand flowers bloom, but if you want the customer to actually make a decision, you've got to get the weed whacker out and call it down to a manageable set of choices. 

(35:17):
The science is very clear on this, that too many choices at some point will overwhelm the customer and it leads to a lot of bad outcomes. It leads to the customer not making a decision at all because they don't want to make the wrong decision. I don't want to work with you, but you put so many options in front of us. I don't want to be blamed if I choose the wrong one and it leads to things like post-decision dysfunction, which is, I thought I made the right decisions, but now I'm learning more and people are asking hard questions and maybe I need to go revisit this. Hey, Lenny, we're going to have to scrap that agreement and start over because I don't think we can figure this right way. 

(35:49):
We have to, there's a time and place to offer options, and there's a time and place to narrow choices up. The simple guidance here for salespeople is that you've got to shift your posture from asking the customer what they want and just diagnosing their needs, to actually recommending to them what they should do. Salespeople get a little bit anxious about this, I find, because they don't want to be seen as like, I told you to do A, but you're like, I don't want to do that. I want to do B and now I feel like we're at odds. 

(36:16):
They worry about that. Salespeople have grown up in this world that it's the customer's choice. The customers always right, let me just guide them, but they're the ones should make this decision, but sometimes the customer can't and they don't know enough about these decisions. We know the stuff because we eat, sleep, and breathe it every day as salespeople. We work in this industry, they don't. 

(36:35):
We are in a much better position to be able to guide them toward, you know what? You don't really need X, Y, and Z. You can leave that out of the proposal. Companies like you, they get started in this way. Let me put three options in front of you. I would go with the middle one because I really think that's going to be the best for you in the first year, and then we can expand from there.

(36:54):
Here's an analogy, I'll often tell people to think about the last time they went to a fancy restaurant and they looked at a menu with some expensive entrees and everything looked delicious, but they didn't know what to order, so you asked the wait person what they recommend. How helpful is it if that wait person says to you, "Well, what are you in the mood to eat tonight?" It's no help at all, right? You're no closer to a decision. They basically just dump the problem back on your lap.

(37:17):
But what a great way people do is they say, "If you want my opinion, I love this dish and I'd probably say it's our most popular. We sell out of it every night. We've still got it. So you're in luck. It's a lot of food though, it's a big portion. If you're in the mood for something lighter, there's a vegetarian option. It doesn't get as much play on Yelp, but I love this one. It's absolutely delicious. It's one of our kind of dark horse favorites, if you will, but remember, everything we make here is delicious. If you don't like those choices, you're not going to go wrong with any of them, but those are just my favorites." 

(37:46):
Now, what happens in that moment is what psychologists call the delegation effect, which is rather than the burden of a bad decision being solely on the shoulders of the decider, that burden is now shared. Now, think about it, if you order the dish the wait person recommended and you don't like it, whose fault is it? Well, technically it's your fault because you ordered it, but it's also kind of their fault because they recommended it. 

(38:07):
You feel like there's some safety in getting that recommendation, that endorsement. It's a really simple example, but it works in complex sales as well. Customers are looking for somebody to share in the risk and the burden of making a bad decision and having that partner who's guiding them toward what they should care about and what they shouldn't care about, what they should consider and what they should take out of the proposal, is actually very reassuring and comforting them and it increases the odds of getting some kind of decision from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:35):
Amazing. This is a great segue to The Challenger Sale, which we're going to talk about, but let's get through the last two steps and then we'll talk about The Challenger Sale, which is basically this on steroids, this idea on steroids.

Matt Dixon (38:45):
The last two, so L is about this customer who's doing endless amounts of research. Every salesperson has seen this customer, they're never happy with the number of reference calls or the amount of research they've done. They want to talk to more and more people. They're just in information overload mode and/or what we might call analysis paralysis mode because at some point, they're never satisfied with, they always feel like all the answers will be in the next white paper they read or the next reference call they do, or the next person on LinkedIn they talk to. 

(39:15):
What salespeople need to do to stop that, you got to understand I think why customers do that. They don't want to be surprised. That is the main reason, but they also don't trust the salesperson to be forthcoming. They believe the salesperson is paid to sell them more than they need, to put one over on them, hide the dirty laundry, only talk about the things that work in the platform, not the things that don't work. 

(39:37):
You're not going to get introduce any of the customers who hate you. You're only going to introduce the customers who love you, and we know we're going to say great things about us. That's what the customer thinks. That is what is in the customer's mind. You've got to actually shift, get the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as an expert. There are two keys to that. 

(39:57):
The first one is you've got to establish some trust. I know that sounds like a platitude, but we found in the analysis, there are specific things that great salespeople do very early on. They are brutally transparent with customers about like, "Hey, I know you were interested in this capability. I got to be honest, we get mixed reviews on that. It's kind of an early capability for us. We're still trying to iron out the kinks," or "I know you are interested in this used case, but I have to be honest, we're actually not the best in the market at that. Our competitors much better at that than we are." 

(40:26):
These kinds of moments show the customer that you're not here to put one over on them. You're here to get them to a great decision. It kind of makes no difference to the salesperson, whether the customer buys from them, doesn't buy from them, it buys from a competitor. You just want to help them get to a great decision. That's step number one is building that trust. 

(40:42):
Step number two is you got to demonstrate some expertise. What we see in so many sales interactions, especially in tech, is that salespeople will show up with the clown car of experts, the subject matter experts, the solutions engineers, the product people, the executive sponsors, and then they will just punt to these people. 

(41:00):
What happens in that moment is dangerous for the salesperson. The customer, it sounds like they're loving it, right? They're loving that. I'm talking to the people who really know their stuff, but what's also happening in that moment is the salesperson is actively getting delegated down to the person they sound like. If they don't sound like any more than a glorified emcee or a coordinator, then that's kind of all the customer will perceive them as. 

(41:21):
What right or ability would you have to guide the customer on what to choose if you've offered no value or expertise? You don't have to be as deep as the product people. You're not going to be, you're a salesperson, you're not a product person, but you do have to be deeper on than the customer, and you do have to demonstrate that expertise. Those are the keys, again, the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as their expert.

(41:43):
Then, the T is taking risk off the table. Two keys to doing that, I think the first one happens really early actually, and that is resetting the customer's expectations. Average salespeople love when they get an inbound lead from a customer who says, "Hey, I saw that case study on your website of the customer who got the 10X improvement in sales productivity, and we want that. That sounds great." That company's in our industry, amazing. That's a slam dunk business case for us. 

(42:09):
The average salesperson's thinking like, "If you're excited about that, I'm not going to talk you out of it because that means you're going to be excited to take in the CFO and excited to sign the agreement and get going." 

(42:16):
What great salespeople do though is they know that while they'll stand by those claims, those case studies, those proof points, they try to kind of under-promise and over-deliver and they might say something along the lines of, "You know Lenny, absolutely, that is a great case. I was involved in that sale, but what we also need to understand is everything went perfectly. They resourced it to the hilt. They had no integration issues, no hiccups. It was beautiful and seamless. I don't think you and I can think of many technology implementations that happened that way. 

(42:45):
What I'd rather we do is build your business case around a 5X improvement in sales productivity because we see that at least that, in 100% of our implementations. Then, let's set up to over-deliver against that because I think we're going to do better than that based on what I know about your organization, easily 6, 7, 8, 9%, maybe even 10, but we don't want you to just walking in and promising 10X improvement sales productivity. If we finish the year and we're at 7X, if the CFO is now asking her questions when in absolute terms, she should be thrilled with 7X, right? Let's make sure we set ourselves up for success." 

(43:18):
The other thing you've got to do though is establish some safety net options. There are lots of different shapes and forms. These can take everything from before the deal is closed, pulling the implementation team onto the call, or the customer success team or the account management team so we can start roadmapping, "Hey, as soon as we get signature, here's how we're going to spend our next six months together to make sure you guys are getting all the value you expect, if not more. Here's what we got to do. Here are the stage gates, here are the owners, here are the metrics we're going to monitor. Here's how often we're going to connect with each other." 

(43:48):
Instills a lot of confidence with the customer because it feels like, "Oh, you guys have done this before, right? You've been there, you've done that. You've helped other customers like me get value." Everything from that kind of stuff to adding in professional services support, especially like you think about a tech purchase. I'm not saying give it away for free, but you will find that high-performing salespeople will also add on professional services, but it is not just because selling more, which they are because they're high-performing salespeople. It's the way they position that.

(44:13):
They usually position it as an insurance policy. "Hey, I know you guys want to DIY this. This is one of the great things about our solution. You totally can. You got all the training support, all the videos, you got all the enablement content you need, but I know this is a big priority for you, and I think it would be really smart to carve out a slug of professional services hours that way our A team is lined up in case anything slips and if it does, we get you back up on track because the last thing we want is for you guys to be upset that you're losing ground and you're not going to deliver on the outcomes that you promised to your boss. So, let's set that up." 

(44:44):
There's lots of different ways we can create those opt out clauses in some industries are an option. Not very common in B2B, but in some cases, you can offer those or specialized contract carve outs for instance. There's lots of different things we can do to create that safety net where the customer doesn't feel like they're jumping out of an airplane by themselves, but you are the tandem skydiving instructor that's going to guide them safely to the ground.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:05):
Amazing. All of this, especially this last step, is coming from, they're probably not going to decide on anything that that's what you're fighting is help them...

Matt Dixon (45:13):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (45:13):
... be less worried about messing up.

Matt Dixon (45:15):
Yeah, that's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (45:16):
I especially love this point about under promising and over delivering because so much of, and most of this is B2B SaaS software that you're working with, right? Like B2B SaaS companies?

Matt Dixon (45:26):
Our dataset cut across, I think that it might just be that SaaS is the place where we're seeing the most indecision these days, but it's not suggest it's kind of an easy target, but it is rife within indecision these days, and unfortunately I think it's also rife with a lot of these missteps that salespeople make that actually make things worse, but we had data from manufacturing firms, services businesses that cut across. This was prevalent and consistent across industries.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:57):
With the under promising and over delivering, I think that's especially powerful for where most companies want to get to is net revenue retention being higher than 100% where you can expand larger within the org and it makes sense to help them set up base, feel like, wow, this is so much better than we even thought it was going to be, versus...

Matt Dixon (45:57):
Absolutely. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (46:15):
... it's not delivering what we thought. Amazing. Okay. Any last piece of wisdom to leave listeners with around The JOLT Effect before we move on to The Challenger Sale?

Matt Dixon (46:25):
The only thing I would suggest is that for anybody, I mean, I think just do it is this, is that you should hit the pause button when the customer, because the customers, we all know, are going to get cold feet, often late stage, and it can be very frustrating. The knee jerk reaction for almost every salesperson out there, this happened in our analysis, 75% of salespeople we studied, would immediately go out to dialing up the FOMO. 

(46:47):
Go back to doing that. You're not going to get these benefits. You're going to be stuck in this terrible state of affairs you're in right now. Dial up the cost of inaction, or let's try to use some price base or other delivery window-based urgency driver to get the customer to move forward. But just remember that if the customer's already convinced that the status quo is suboptimal, and you've already got the intent that basically again, you're using fear on top of a customer, selling into a customer who's already afraid and you're actually making it worse. 

(47:17):
Hitting the pause button and just reflecting a little bit on what's really going on here. Is it that they're indifferent or is it that they're indecisive? Those are actually two very different things.

Lenny Rachitsky (47:26):
Amazing. I know you have a meeting in 10 minutes, so this is going to be the most action-packed, high-density podcast episode we've done. We've got 10 minutes talk about Challenger Sale. 

Matt Dixon (47:33):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (47:33):
First of all, how many copies of this book have you sold at this point?

Matt Dixon (47:37):
I think it's about a million. 

Lenny Rachitsky (47:39):
Holy moly. 

Matt Dixon (47:39):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (47:39):
That's insane.

Matt Dixon (47:39):
That's a lot, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (47:42):
Okay, so it's a legendary book in the world of sales. I imagine many people have heard of it, at least some people know the teachings. Let's spend a little time there. If I were to summarize the big insight of the book, basically it's the best salespeople challenge their prospects thinking and teach them about the market and what they should be doing versus just helping them get what they want.

Matt Dixon (47:59):
Yeah, very well said. I think one of, just like the FOMO, FOMU kind of shorthand, here's a shorthand I'd give to salespeople is most salespeople are trying to figure out what's keeping the customer up at night, right? It's classic solution selling needs, diagnosis, et cetera. 

(48:15):
The Challenger approach is about showing the customer what should be keeping them up at night. What is the thing you know that they need to know? What is the way that other customers are using your solution to generate returns and benefit for their organization? What's the risk that they don't know about but you do because by the way, you're going to talk to 10 times more customers, or I say you're going to talk to 10 of that customer in a week or 10 times more than a week than they will all year. 

(48:42):
You are a window into the outside world for them, and that's what challengers really understand. It's not free consulting though, because if you remember from the Challenger Sale, it's not just about bringing these provocative ideas that reframe the customer's understanding of the world. It's about leading to your unique benefits. What you're really trying to do is create a fire and then be the only person in town who sells the fire extinguisher that'll put it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (49:05):
Is there an example you could share of a Challenger sale type of sale?

Matt Dixon (49:08):
Yeah, we wrote a sequel to The Challenger Sale called The Challenger Customer. In that book, we talk about a case from a company called Dentsply. Dentsply, as the name would suggest, manufactures or produces dental supplies, right? They sell equipment and product into dental practices and dental offices. 

(49:27):
Years ago, Dentsply had developed, we all know, I think your listeners can all relate to this, when you go to the dentist and the hygienist is polishing your teeth or they're using the water pick, or unfortunately, maybe the dentist is using the drill. That wand has a very heavy power cord that's attached to it and it's attached to this power base and that it feeds water through there and electrical current and all those things. 

(49:51):
Dentsply had developed the world's first lightweight, ergonomic, cordless wand that drill bits could be attached to cleaning, implements, et cetera and it was a total breakthrough. Actually, when they unveiled it was pretty interesting, they gave, you remember the scene in Pulp Fiction where they opened the briefcase and then it emanates like a light emits from it. They gave all their salespeople like this little aluminum briefcase thing with this eggshell foam and a wand in there. 

(50:19):
I can't remember what it's called. Let's call it the XP-9000 Wand, but it had one demo wand in there and they would go around to dental offices and be like, "Ah." It was lit, literally, it had blue lighting inside... 

Lenny Rachitsky (50:30):
Wow.

Matt Dixon (50:30):
... and it was really cool, the reveal and they'd take it out and they give it to the dentist or the head of the dental office and they would hold it and be like, "What? It's so much lighter and it's ergonomic and this thing is cordless? It's amazing. It's a revolution." Then, the first thing they would ask is, "How much is it?"

(50:47):
When they told them it costs like three times more than the current old-fashioned wands they're using with the heavy cord, they would gently put it back in the briefcase, close the briefcase, say, "Can you give me a price on new drill bits or new like polishing attachments?" They couldn't get anybody to want to pay for this thing that was much more expensive than the old one. 

(51:06):
They did a lot of work and they figured out, they knew that this was unique. They knew this was a unique product. Nobody else in the market made this. They're the only supplier who had figured this out, total innovation, but they hadn't given the customer reason to want to pay a premium for that innovation until they figured out the connection between the equipment that hygienists use and absenteeism and workers' comp. 

(51:32):
It turns out that one of the biggest professions that where you get carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder and neck and lower back injuries is being a dental hygienist. The reason is that they're standing, holding that heavy wand being dragged down by that heavy cord at an awkward angle all day long. That's why dental offices really struggle to keep hygienists showing up, not calling in sick, not out for months at a time for reconstructive shoulder surgery, not with exorbitant health benefits claims and workers' comp claims. 

(52:08):
They came in and they revised their sales pitch. Now, when they come into the dental office, they sit down, they say, "I'd like to talk to you about your hygienist workforce. Are you guys seeing higher turnover? Have you seen any absenteeism due to carpal or lower back or neck or shoulder injuries? What are you guys doing about that? What's the cost to your business?" 

(52:26):
They get the dentist talking and the way they start talking about, "It is not just the insurance and workers' comp costs, it's stuff like when my hygienists get injured, and it's a repetitive motion business and job, when they get injured and they call in sick, I've got to reschedule all these cleanings and all these appointments, and that's a bunch of upset customers who end up then going to the practice down the street or saying bad things about me on Google reviews or what have you." 

(52:52):
There's all kinds of ripple effects for the dentist. The cost of losing a hygienist is massive and the market for hiring them is very, very tight. What Dentsply does is start the conversation there, and then they say, "One of the things that we figured out is that, based on our own independent research, one of the primary drivers of all these bad outcomes, absenteeism, repetitive motion injuries, is related to the equipment that hygienists use. It's because they're holding that old fashioned heavy wand, attached to that big heavy power cable at an awkward angle doing repetitive motion all day, but what if you could solve for that? What if that was no longer a problem?" 

(53:33):
The dentist says, "Well, how would you solve for that? There's no other technology." "That's what we got. We've had the same equipment for 30 years. Let me show you the new XP-9000. We're world's first cordless, lightweight, ergonomic drill. We can show you that it is far preferred by hygienists because they don't get injured as often because it's much easier to hold and it doesn't put stress on the joints and pinch points, if you will, where hygienists tend to experience these injuries." 

(53:58):
It's just a simple example, but you see, again, they're still selling a fancy wand, but before, they were leading with it. Let me show you this and talk about the features, benefits, and that led to how much does it cost. Now, they're leading to it. They're starting with an insight and giving the customer a reason to care about solving this business problem, and it turns out the only way to solve it is buying this XP-9000 drill from Dentsply.

Lenny Rachitsky (54:22):
The key lesson from this book, and I know we don't have a ton of time to dig into it, is start with an insight they may not be aware of. Give them a sense of where the things are going. Help them learn something about the future and the problems that they need to know about that they may not be aware of, and then transition to here is how we can solve that for you.

Matt Dixon (54:40):
Yeah, that's exactly right. Make sure those connections are really tight, right? Getting this right starts with answering the question, why should the customer buy from you instead of your competitor? It's not because you're more customer-centric or more innovative and possible to prove your competitors claim the same thing. It's not that you're the leading global solution provider of whatever you sell. 

(54:59):
It starts with the product or the way you deliver the product or something about your service delivery that only your company does you are only capable of. Nobody else can touch with the barge pole. Then, the second question is, what would have to be true for the customer to want to pay us for that, to pay a premium ideally? That's the core components, if you will, of a challenge or a conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (55:21):
Amazing. Matt, I promised I let you out here in time. Final questions, where can folks find your books if they want to dig in further and how can listeners be useful to you?

# "I deliberately understaff every project" | Leadership lessons from Rippling's $16B journey

## Transcript

Matt MacInnis (00:00:00):
It is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company. If you overstaff, you get politics, you get people working on things that are further down the priority list than necessary. That is poison. It's wasteful. It slows you down. It creates cruft.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You've been a long time COO at Rippling. Recently, you moved into CPO, Chief Product Officer at Rippling. Something you talk a lot about is that extraordinary results require extraordinary efforts.

Matt MacInnis (00:00:26):
If you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult. You got to sort of remind people that if they ever find themselves in the comfort zone at work, they are definitely making a mistake. It's supposed to be really fricking exhausting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
You're a big fan of escalating issues.

Matt MacInnis (00:00:41):
Fundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. When you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable. Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort, and it's fundamentally selfish. So many people have teams that are not functioning incredibly well. Teams will always optimize for local comfort over company outcomes. The purest form of ambition and most intense source of energy in the business is the founder CEO. Every next concentric circle of management beyond the founder CEO has the potential to be an order of magnitude drop off in intensity. That is fucking dangerous.

(00:01:17):
As an executive, as a leader, your job is to preserve that intensity at its highest possible level. You've had a couple really interesting experiences with your own startup. We talk in Silicon Valley about never quit, but that is complete absolute venture capital.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guest is Matt MacInnis, Chief Product Officer and formerly longtime Chief Operating Officer at Rippling. If you don't know much about Rippling, it's a massively successful business last valued at over $16 billion. They have over 5,000 employees, and Matt has been instrumental to that success. He's also got a really rare combination of brutal honesty, a ton of experience building a very complex and very successful business, and being able to clearly articulate what he has learned really well. Matt shared a lot of insights and advice that I've not heard anyone else on this podcast share, and I left this conversation feeling that every leader needs to hear his advice.

(00:02:12):

Have you ever wanted to build an app for yourself, your friends, or finally launch that side project you've been dreaming about? Now you can bring any idea to life, no coding background required with Gemini three in Google AI Studio. It's called vibe coding and we're making it dead simple. Just describe your app and Gemini will wire up the right models for you so you can focus on your creative vision. Head to ai.studio/build to create your first app.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:18):
This episode is brought to you by Datadog, now home to Eppo, the leading experimentation and feature flagging platform. Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog, the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX friction, and business impact. It starts with product analytics where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus, experiments prove what works.

(00:03:56):
I saw this firsthand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong. And the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Eppo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with heat maps and scroll maps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics. It's where great product teams learn faster, fix smarter, and ship with confidence. Request a demo at datadoghq.com/lenny. That's datadoghq.com/lenny.

(00:04:43):
Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. Thank you for having me. I want to start with something that I know is really important to you, something you talk a lot about that I don't think people hear enough on podcasts like this, which is that extraordinary results require extraordinary efforts. Talk about why this is so important, what you think people need to hear.

Matt MacInnis (00:05:04):
This is a term, that phrasing I actually attribute to a friend of mine, Dan Gill, who's the chief product officer at Carvana, which as a company also doesn't get enough credit for how much of a tech company it actually is. Super interesting. And I think as a general framework for me, and a lot of what I say with you today is not really specific to product in any way. We should actually talk about that. It's like the product function is an instantiation of the general concept of management. Being a chief product officer is not that different from being a chief whatever officer. You have to apply the same frameworks and concepts to get people to achieve goals together. But one thing that is absolutely universal that I think we, honestly, I think we forget it in Silicon Valley or a lot of people don't sort of internalize it, is that if you want to accomplish something truly extraordinary, if you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult.

(00:05:56):
It's going to be really uncomfortable. And you got to sort of remind people of that, that if they ever find themselves in the comfort zone at work, they are definitely making a mistake. They have definitely screwed up somehow. It's not that an extraordinary effort is sufficient to an extraordinary outcome, but it is 100% true that it is necessary. And so I do use that framework as a sort of guiding principle in my own leadership.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:23):
To make this even more real for people, what are examples of moments that were extraordinarily hard?

Matt MacInnis (00:06:29):
It is not about any sort of grand single story. I think the story is actually told through a thousand little things. And so for me, the story is told through a thousand Jira tickets, not through a thousand grand events. The extraordinary effort thing is a reminder that it's supposed to be really fricking exhausting. It's supposed to be. So on Friday night, when you get hit with an escalation on Friday night, when you get sort of hit with a bunch of new bugs from someone in the engineering team that you've got a triage, those are the moments where great players and great teams are separated from good players and good teams. And it's so easy to say this at a company like Rippling because we're winning. As a company, for all of our foibles, and we should spend time today talking about where things are not perfect and not great, but the growth rate of the company on the revenue foundation that we have is extraordinary, really, really compelling.

(00:07:33):
And it gives you, as a leader, the air cover to get up in front of your team and say, "Hey guys, I need the last ounce of oil that you've got left." And if your company's not growing very quickly, if things aren't that great, if your growth rate is 30% or 40%, it doesn't feel as good as a contributor in that business to lean in and give everything you've got on Friday or Saturday or Sunday because you don't know that it's going to yield much. And so extraordinary results, outcomes demand extraordinary efforts, but if there's no chance at an extraordinary outcome, it's very hard to get the extraordinary effort. And so I like to remind people at Rippling at least that it's so rare to have the opportunity to be able to be a part of a team where the extraordinary effort that you do put in on Friday or whatever, whenever it is actually contributing to an extraordinary result.

(00:08:27):
It's a very special and rare thing, and it gives me a superpower as a leader because I can lean on that when I'm ringing the oil out of somebody who's in the bored and tired zone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:38):
I saw the same thing actually at Airbnb with Brian Chesky. It always felt like things were going great and maybe we could take a break after something we shipped was killing it. And it always felt like the opposite. It always felt like, how do we press the gas pedal further? How do we go faster? How do we go bigger? There's never a moment to take a break.

Matt MacInnis (00:08:57):
I spent seven years at Apple and learned under Steve Jobs when he was the CEO, learned what we called the death march, which is what we did to the engineers. It was like as soon as you shipped one version of the iPhone, you were just immediately thrown into the pit of building the next one and there was no break. It was just relentless and talk about an extraordinary outcome at the end of the day. There is no relief. In a competitive market, and if the market is valuable, it's competitive, no question. If you leave anything on the field, if you sort of leave a crack for your competitor, 100% chance they're going to go fill that crack. And so you have to be relentless. There can be no relaxation of the organization. It doesn't mean people can't come and go or people can't take vacations or live their lives, of course.

(00:09:48):
And it's not like people are human beings. You can't grind the individuals down, but the team as a collective group of people has to be sort of on the ball all the time. There can't be a break. And if you leave one, you're just begging for the slightly more hungry competitor to come in and eat your lunch. And that's the beauty of capitalism.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Also, very counterintuitively, and maybe the more optimistic perspective here is when you do give your team space to just twiddle their thumbs, bad things start to happen. Morale actually dips in my experience. People get distracted. They're like, "Oh, what are we even doing? It's not interesting." I find that keeping people busy and motivated and fired up, even though you may think they'll be happier taking a many week break and slowing things down, I find they get more, the more I actually goes down in those moments.

Matt MacInnis (00:10:44):
So here's a management framework that I use fairly often. As an executive, you don't know how to get any decision exactly right. It's not knowable. You don't know how much budget to allocate. You don't know how many people to put on a project. You don't know how to set a deadline for when you're going to ship something. But of course, you have to set some default so you make your best guess and then you manage to that best guess and you learn as you go because in software development and in business in general, everything's emergent. These are not things that are knowable top down or a priority. And so you take a best guess and knowing that you're not going to get the right answer, you need to decide whether over-steering or under-steering relative to your perceived midpoint is better. And so let's talk about staffing. When you staff a project, is it better to overstaff or is it better to under-staff knowing that you can't get it right? Well, it's better to under-staff. If you overstaff, you get everything that you just said. You get politics, you get people working, I think most importantly on things that are further down the priority list than necessary. You have like 20 things on a stack rank list and you know that you got to do the top five, but the next 15 data's kind of ambiguous, but you've overstaffed the project. So the next 10 things down are getting worked on. Before you even know if they're necessary, that is poison. It's wasteful, it slows you down, it creates crust. And so it's very clear that under-staffing is less evil than over-staffing. In this particular framework, the advice is under-staff deliberately, always. And then the wisdom, the wisdom element is to know not to under-under-staff and sort of knowing the difference between those two things.

(00:12:22):
And so that's the way we work at Rippling. Everyone is constantly asking for more resources and of course where we can afford to and where it's appropriate new resources arrive, but it is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):
There's a previous guest, I forget who this was. They used this metaphor if they want their team to be dehydrated to always be wanting more water. And then eventually they're too dehydrated and okay, we needed someone to help. Interesting. Yeah. There's a line along the lines of extraordinary efforts I want to make sure I read because I think this is really good. This may be a way to summarize what you're saying, that good teams get tired and that's when great teams kick the good team's asses.

Matt MacInnis (00:13:04):
Yes. This was a quote actually from Sunil, and he found it from a women's basketball team coach. And it is, to my point earlier about you got to run the engine at the red line at all times because the minute you let your guard down, the minute you slow down, the minute you relax, the minute you leave a crack for your competition, the great teams are going to come in and kick the good team's. And it's like sports, I'm not a very sporty guy, but sports analogies are sort of irresistible because at the end of the day, business is a game and none of this matters. We're not going to carry it to the grave. It's like you're here to do this stuff because it somehow fulfills you while you're on the planet. And I love the sport of business and I find that sports, notwithstanding the fact that I watched very little of it, that military, those are very ripe sources of parallel concepts to apply in leadership.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:56):
I find also those most intense, stressful, long nights are the moments you remember most and remember most fondly back to when you're building something. The key though is that it has to go well. As you said, if you are succeeding and winning, all of this is romantic in the end and nostalgic. Remember that time we built this thing and worked late nights and shipped this thing? If it doesn't go anywhere, you don't feel that. So I think that's a really important component of this is you need to be winning and succeeding.

Matt MacInnis (00:14:23):
One thing that I've learned from Parker, Parker's our CEO at Rippling, he said, "You don't really learn from your mistakes, you learn from your successes." And it's like you do, of course, and he would admit you learn a bit from mistakes, but I do think that this is sort of feel good that it's like, "Well, you didn't succeed, but at least you learned something." I've had failures. When I look back at the nine years I spent working on inkling from day one in 2009 until we sold that business to a private equity firm in 2018, up the curve of Silicon Valley coolness, back down the other side into obscurity. Of course, I learned and grew a ton during that time, but in now what I think is six or seven years, I'm trying to do the math, seven years coming up on at Rippling, I've learned so much more because I've seen success.

(00:15:13):
I've seen rapid, wild, crazy off the charts success of the business and it's more informative. There's more to glean from seeing how it's done right than there is to glean from seeing how it's done wrong. If I tell you you're going to get on an airplane and one maintenance technician has seen it done right a hundred times and the other maintenance technician has seen it done wrong a hundred times, but he learned from his mistakes, but still hasn't had any success himself. I mean, give me a break. There's not even a comparison which plane you're going to feel more comfortable on. And so I do think that learning from your mistakes thing is a bit of a feel good trope that actually has very little substance in reality. And it's why as an early career product manager, or it's why frankly at any stage of your career when you want to learn, you should join a winning team.

(00:15:57):
It's cool to go and start a company at 22. Good luck to you. The odds are not in your favor, but the folks who, when I look at a resume and I see that someone's joined, they were at really good companies when those companies were super exciting and in crazy growth mode. I'm like, "I instantly want to interview that candidate because I want to hear what they learned from being part of a winning team." And that's sort of one of my go to heuristics when I'm looking at candidate profiles and I think it's an under-told trope. Sorry, not an under-told trope. It's a piece of advice that I don't think people embrace enough in the valley that success begets success and you should chase success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:35):
Speaking of success and learning, you've been a long time COO at Rippling and the reason you're here recently you moved into CPO, chief product officer at Rippling, which is very exciting and very rare. I don't see a lot of COOs moving into product. Let me ask you why did you move into that role? I feel like you've been killing it at COO. Maybe that's the reason. Be careful what you're good at. And also just what are some surprises about this, about moving into product? Because a lot of people imagine what it's like and then you're actually doing it.

Matt MacInnis (00:17:08):
The story at Rippling is pretty interesting and I'll tell it because I think it explains why I'm making this transition, but this isn't really about me. I think it's sort of a pattern that your listeners would find useful. In general, your best executives are the ones that you can mostly toss into any challenge and they will bring order to chaos. They will fix the thing. And I do appreciate the terms that people have used at Rippling for me, talking about MacInnis's injured birds, where at any given moment some function is in disarray or in jeopardy and I go and focus very carefully on that function to get it back in order batting 800 maybe, like not always wild success, but I did that everywhere except R&D. I would think about helping out with components of the sales organization like our channel team, or I spent time building out the recruiting function a few times when it needed to be sort of rethought in response to our growth, but it never R&D.

(00:18:23):
And so I would have my feet up on the table looking out across the floor at this dumpster fire off in the distance, just sort of emitting smoke and wondering if someone was going to go in and deal with that. And the smoke takes various forms and when you're growing as quickly as rippling is growing, it's not always something that necessarily even impacts customers, but it's the sort of thing where you're like, that architecture's not right or they're not measuring adoption correctly." From the outside, I actually had quite a few criticisms that I could lob in. And what happened at Rippling was we made some hiring mistakes. I think the folks that we had in those roles would agree that they weren't the right people. We had a hiring mistake in engineering leadership where the product leader at the time had to sort of run engineering.

(00:19:07):
We subsequently had a mistake in product hiring and a lot of us had to sort of pitch in. And Parker and I sort of stared at each other through two years of this kind of disarray or this chaos or this agony of things and just never really having good executive leadership over both engineering and product at the same time. And I remember Parker sort of slumped down in his seat and said, "Oh, I have to run another search." And I said, "No, the gig's up. I'm going to go do it." And he really sprung up in his seat. He's like, "Really? You'll go do that?" I'm like, "Dude, this is what the business needs." And so that's what I did. And that really started about a year ago in sort of, I realized I was going to do it and expressed that to Parker in December. I really took it on in January of '25.

(00:19:51):
And so it's been 11 months of learning. Jumping into the product role when the product function itself, although staffed with really talented people, wildly under understaffed, and without a single spiritual leader on top of it to drive consistency and process excellence had become locally optimized but globally incoherent. And if you know Conway's law, you are destined to ship your org chart. And so with a locally optimized, globally incoherent team, you had a locally optimized, globally incoherent product experience that needed to be resolved. And so my efforts over the last 11 months have been to establish greater clarity in terms of how we do things around here, better process, better general leadership, hiring and firing. I mean, just doing the sort of cleanup on aisle three that needed to be done, even though, again, a lot of the people in the team were quite talented and doing an excellent job of managing their specific domains.

(00:20:52):
Jumping into the product role has been quite eye-opening. I feel a little bashful about the naivety of my view from the outside a year ago. Product teams have a hierarchy of needs, and we like to point at the failures to meet elements of that hierarchy higher up the triangle and sort of impugn the failure of that organization for not, as an example, measuring adoption metrics very carefully and not closely tracking those metrics as a means by which to drive execution. When I jumped in, I was like, "Man, we need to establish some basic standards for test coverage. We need to establish some basic standards for how we do what I call a factory inspection on a product once it's ready to roll off the assembly line." Do we have a checklist for what we call product quality and what does product quality mean? Those basic things weren't there. And so the idea that we should be spending time measuring adoption metrics is absolute insanity.

(00:22:08):
You're skipping a lot of steps between here and there. And so we have made great strides and I think it's translating to product quality improvements for our customers, but I feel, as I said, a little dumb for the way I was thinking about it before I jumped into the deep end. There is just no excuse as an executive for sitting outside of the mess and thinking you know the answers. It's a cardinal sin as an executive to do that. You need to go and see. You'd be in the boiler room, you need to study the system, bottom up and develop hypotheses for how to amend the system. And that's what I've been doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
I love hearing this because so many people have teams that are not functioning incredibly well and hearing from someone that is not a longtime product person come in and try to fix these problems, I think is really useful and interesting for people to hear. To dig into this a little bit more, was the big lesson and kind of eye-opening moment that there's a lot of foundational work that needs to happen to achieve this outcome that you're trying to achieve, which is measure engagement and adoption well? Is it like tracking and metrics and data science? Is that kind of the lesson there?

Matt MacInnis (00:23:18):
The lesson is that everything must be done in its time and order, and you can move really, really quickly. There's no sort of excuse not to move with urgency on all of these things, but you got to do them in order and you have to lead bottom up. You got to lead from the specific circumstances you observe. And I think for me, one of the best things that's happened over the last 11 months is that I've gained a greater trust in my own instincts, that sort of patterns I've matched across other functions do indeed apply in product, but I have both the advantage and disadvantage of not having led a product function before and therefore must think about every problem from first principles. I have no choice. I can read shit on the internet. I can listen to clear thinkers on topics and import their ideas, but I'm very reluctant to import an idea without breaking it down into its constituent parts and figuring out how it applies at Rippling.

(00:24:29):
And so I don't actually give a shit about adoption metrics as a matter of principle. I care about adoption metrics when I care about adoption metrics. I realize that that's a total logical statement, but it's like I'll get there. And so in certain parts of our product, I really do care about adoption metrics. I care a lot about adoption metrics in our applicant tracking system, our recruiting product, because it's in a really good place from a usability standpoint, it's very well instrumented, it's got very happy users, it's got an awesome growth profile, and so we should still ...

Matt MacInnis (00:25:00):
It's got an awesome growth profile. So we should be really focused on the adoption metrics because I think that's going to be an important ingredient to low churn over time, removing friction from the implementation process as an example.

(00:25:13):
There are other parts of our product where I would say I don't care at all about adoption and am much more focused on foundational things like I said earlier, test coverage or whatever, just to make sure that the thing is stable and good and delivering exactly what it's supposed to deliver once it's adopted.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:28):
Now that you're on the inside of the product team, what's something that you think people outside of product, say Matt two years ago or other, I don't know, go to market leads, other execs should hear, need to understand about product that they don't until they're on the inside?

Matt MacInnis (00:25:44):
I'll give you another framework that I like to use. In the financial world, there's this concept of alpha. Alpha is outperformance relative to the index. So that's why you have seekingalpha.com as a very popular website. What they mean by that is you're looking to buy something, some combination of assets that will outperform, let's say the S&P 500, if that's your benchmark. So alpha is the outperformance relative to the index.

(00:26:12):
And then you have the concept of beta. Beta is just volatility. Beta's not good. A high beta stock jerks around for no particular reason. It's discorrelated with the index. It's very high beta. Great if you're an options trader, but other than that, it's not really something you want in an asset.

(00:26:28):
So your ideal stock is a very high alpha, very low beta stock. They don't really come in that shape because alpha and beta tend to be correlated, but that's what you want when you buy a financial asset.

(00:26:40):
So what's the analogy? I think you have high alpha people who are very valuable. I think you also have low beta people who are also very valuable people. Dennis Rodman, basketball player, nut job, very high alpha. And there's room on every team for one Dennis Rodman is a favorite of mine. It's like you can have one difficult employee who's got a ton of upside.

(00:27:12):
So this alpha beta thing, I use it pretty often when contemplating what kind of person I want and also what kind of process I want. So when you're building a product from zero to one, you're probably pursuing alpha. You're looking for some angle on this market or this customer problem where the product is actually going to provide an outsized return relative to whatever the default solution is. When you have a more mature product or if you have somebody in the product operations group or whatever, you probably want a more low beta environment where it's like it cranks it out, it does it very reliably.

(00:27:44):
Our payroll product, we badly want the payroll product to be very low beta. We really don't want the payroll product to have any unpredictability or aberration, and so we're willing to accept more process.

(00:27:55):
And here's a fundamental principle of design in an organization, which is that processes, processes in a business exist for the sole purpose of lowering beta. Processes are for decreasing volatility in the output of the system. The downside of a process is that it suppresses alpha. And you have to be super, super careful and judicious in the application of process and the product team to know that you're lowering beta in the places where you want to do that without suppressing alpha in the places where you need it.

(00:28:35):
So as we've gone through the last year of reforming the way that we build product at Rippling, it's been a game of recognizing those places where I need to implement a touch of process, just a touch. Other places where I need to implement a very clear, rigid process where I don't want alpha, I just want low beta. So examples of this are let's say our product quality list, which we lovingly at Rippling call the PQL.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:00):
Why PQL?

Matt MacInnis (00:29:01):
Yeah, so it's actually a really important thing. I think if you want to bring about cultural change in a team ... Look, we have 1,300 people in our R&D organization. It's a big ship that we have to steer. If you want to create a moment that sticks in people's brains and sort of becomes a zeitgeist or something that they latch onto, you got to create an entity, a vessel for meaning, and then you got to fill that vessel with your meaning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):
A meme, you might say.

Matt MacInnis (00:29:24):
Yeah, well, sure, a meme. A meme is actually a good example of this in common culture. In pop culture. I think it's why, when people come to the table with ideas from the outside, I welcome those outside ideas. But the first thing I ask the person to do is to tell me what they mean without using those words. So when someone comes in and says, "Hey, I want to do this thing on strategy." I'm like, "Cool. Tell me what you mean without using the word strategy." And it forces them to break it down into its constituent parts. And if they can articulate it clearly without using that word, I know that they know what they're talking about. And if they just fumble around with the word strategy again, I'm like, "Okay, you actually haven't thought this through."

(00:30:01):
So with the PQL, with the product quality list, it's like I could come up with some generic term for this, but I really want a new joiner at the company to understand that this is an idiosyncratic thing to Rippling. This is unique to us. You want to understand this thing. I also want it to become a component of common parlance in the day-to-day work of the product management and engineering teams. So PQL, as cheeky or silly as it sounds, was deliberately sort of angular or stood out as a vessel I could fill with a particular meaning, and so we have a product quality list.

(00:30:32):
And the product quality list is lightweight in the sense that it just articulates in the simplest ways the standards we want you to meet when you ship a product. It doesn't apply to every product, not every line applies to every product, but it's comprehensive and it provides me with a framework for iterating over time as we learn.

(00:30:50):
So just yesterday, we shipped the product to Parker. This is part of our process. When we ship a new product, it goes to Parker, who is the big admin for Rippling at Rippling. If you're not aware, Parker is the sole payroll administrator for Rippling for all 5,200 employees. He personally runs payroll always, there is no exception, for all 5,200 people. He does complain about it sometimes, but it's a remarkable achievement for the software and perhaps for him. So he also installs any new app that we're going to install for ourselves because we dog food the hell out of everything we build.

(00:31:22):
Yesterday, he goes to install this new application. We're about to ship a new app for feedback, allowing people to give one another feedback on their companies. And he installs it and he goes in and it dumps them onto an empty screen. And he's like, "What the fuck is this? What is this? What's going on? Hey, wow, talk about fail." So I chop another one of my fingers off, I'm down to nine. And I'm like, "Well, what did we miss?"

(00:31:48):
What we missed was there was a fucking feature flag, a fucking feature flag. And I'm not allowed to say feature flag without fucking in front of it because feature flags are the bane of my existence and the worst things in the world that constantly cause problems. Engineers put one in temporarily and forget about it. It's like shims if you're building a house and the general contractor puts little shims in places and then forgets that they put the shims there and then builds a wall over them and eventually the shim fails and all of a sudden your door doesn't fit. Feature flags are super dangerous and need to be managed carefully, so fucking feature flags.

(00:32:18):
Anyway, we had one. Parker installs it, they forgot to disable the feature flag. He gets a blank screen when he installs the application. What did I do? My reaction was, "Ugh." Go back to the team, give them direct feedback, tell them not to make that mistake again. But also ask the question, "How do we miss this in the factory inspection process?"

(00:32:37):
And the answer is we didn't have any line item in the PQL for feature flags. So I added a line to the fucking PQL that said, "You are allowed to have one feature flag that governs your entire product at ship." It's an extreme standard that might not be achievable, but it's the standard we aspire to.

(00:32:59):
This framework, the PQL, given these lightweight checklists, iterated on consistently in response to everything we learn as we go, constitutes a very nice lightweight way to lower the beta of the system with hopefully only a modicum of negative impact on the alpha for how we build product.

(00:33:22):
You asked me a very simple question, I gave you a very long-winded answer, but these frameworks help me design systems that scale across one going to 2,000 technical workers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:34):
Wow. Okay. By the way, PQL, is that like an acronym or it's just like, I like this word we're going to call it PQL?

Matt MacInnis (00:33:40):
Product quality list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
Okay, I see. So it's the [inaudible 00:33:44]. Okay.

Matt MacInnis (00:33:46):
PQL, which how could you pronounce it other than pickle?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:49):
I'm imagining all your decks have little PQL emojis and the-

Matt MacInnis (00:33:53):
The pickle emoji thing, the dancing pickle in Slack, there's a lot of-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:56):
[inaudible 00:33:56].

Matt MacInnis (00:33:56):
Yeah. It lends itself to a bit of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):
What I think about is pickle Rick. Do you get that reference?

Matt MacInnis (00:34:02):
This is a Rorschach test.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:04):
Okay. So this high alpha, low beta, I love this concept. So the idea is depending on the team, depending on the problem, we need a high alpha, low beta person or actually okay with a lot of variants for this specific project that's actually [inaudible 00:34:16]-

Matt MacInnis (00:34:16):
Yeah, we're willing to accept a bunch of volatility in this area in exchange for the upside we get from the creativity and risk taking of these people or the lack of process that sort of gives them the latitude to do what they want to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:26):
So when you're hiring, you're looking for, again, is this person low beta or not? That's going to [inaudible 00:34:30]-

Matt MacInnis (00:34:30):
For sure. It's really quite a useful way. You know when you meet a candidate and you ... My modus operandi, and I think with talk about hiring for a second, I think I've spent a lot of time with teams at Rippling talking about how I hire. And it is born of batting practice. It'd be super interesting to actually be able to rewind the tape on my life and sort of contemplate how many candidates I've met in every context. Many thousands, maybe tens of thousands, I don't know. It's a lot of batting practice and a lot of model training in my brain.

(00:35:06):
So I rely a lot of my intuition, which of course HR people say you're not supposed to do. That's complete bullshit. If you have a good intuition, you should absolutely rely on your intuition.

(00:35:15):
And what you have to do after you have a reaction to a candidate when you're looking at hiring somebody is you need to decode your intuition so that it can be expressed to other people productively. So one of the frameworks that I use for this is SPOTAC. It's a very ugly acronym. There's a hat tip to somebody out there in the universe who originally thought of this. It's not me, but I adopted it. And it's that people are smart, passionate, optimistic, tenacious, adaptable, and kind. Those five things. Six, can't even count. I told you I lost a finger when I made a mistake, so I was down one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:54):
Nine to go.

Matt MacInnis (00:35:54):
SPOTAC isn't by itself a good top down framework, but when you're thinking about, "Oh, why did this candidate just ... Why did it not click? Why did I not like them?" You go down the list, you're like, "Oh, yeah, no, this person, it's that they were not excited about the idea. They weren't passionate." It's that they talked shit about their previous manager and that they were a victim of the performance of their last two companies. That's what it was, they're not optimistic.

(00:36:24):
The framework is super useful to evaluating people. And I think the alpha beta framework is also super useful when you come away from a conversation and you're like, "I like that guy. I think he'd be really, really good. Why is it that I don't think he would do a good job on this product in particular?" And the answer is like, "This is a high alpha product area and he's a low beta person." Valuable, but definitely not the right fit for this. So I think it's really useful in that context as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:48):
I love all these frameworks. You're speaking to this audience, framework to frameworks, frameworks.

Matt MacInnis (00:36:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:53):
So high alpha, low beta, sometimes high beta is okay, SPOTAC. In hiring, is there anything else that you find really useful? Before we move on to a different topic.

Matt MacInnis (00:37:03):
When I first started working in the product organization, I was introduced to an interview framework or an interview tactic that I hadn't really used much at all, I think in my career, which is that every product person at every seniority level is given the same case study. And the case study is extraordinarily difficult. It requires you to think about many, many dimensions simultaneously, to think about data propagation issues. It gets quite technical.

(00:37:37):
And the rubric that we use to sort of evaluate performance of that case study is it gives you guidance on what for us, like an entry level PM looks like, what a junior, mid-career, senior executive PM might look like. And everybody comes away from that interview feeling like poop, like they had failed it. Whereas on our side of it, we're like, "Wow, that person got really far." They saw around three or four corners in a really impressive way. There was 10 they didn't see around, but they saw around four of the hardest ones. And they were not defensive when we gave them new information that called into question the validity of their solution. And they were willing to interrupt us to ask more questions," and and and, like a lot of the sort of basic human interaction models.

(00:38:25):
You never think that giving someone an impossible task and even including the L5 person versus the VP on the same thing would be productive. And let's just say our recruiting team still sort of kvetches a bit about this and feels like we eliminate people too aggressively at this stage of the interview process. But I've found the wisdom in it and think it's actually quite useful to give everyone the same simple, complicated prompt and just see. Hand them a drill bit, give them the concrete wall and see if they can get a millimeter or an inch into the concrete. They're never going to get all the way through the wall. It doesn't matter. You're going to learn a lot. And I've found that to be kind of an eye-opening new thing for me that has been fun.

(00:39:04):
Look, the joy of product and the joy of product management and the joy of being part of product, I think there's a bunch of joys actually, if I could give you a sort of running list, but one of the big joys is that you get to work with some of the smartest people in software. Engineers are very smart. They're not always the best sort of social entities. Salespeople are awesome social entities. They're not always the best systems thinkers. You go down the list.

(00:39:28):
But the magic of product management is that you kind of have to ... We talk about the mini CEO. I think it's kind of a stupid misnomer, but there's some wisdom there. And I think the wisdom is that you have to be a polymath. You've got to be really good at working with other people. You got to be good at communications and articulation. You got to be good at project management. You got to be good at the science and the math and the engineering. And it's really fucking cool. So I think one of the great joys of this job for me has been interacting with the tippity top of the smartest and most polymathic people in the industry.

(00:40:01):
I'll say one other thing about what I love about leading product, which is as a COO, my job was to accept the product as it was and optimize everything around that. My job was to make sure that the product operations, in our business, the interface to the insurance carriers, the interface to the payment entities, the government regulators, that stuff all just sort of worked. It was to make sure that our sales engine, our marketing engine, all the go to-market stuff optimized itself around what the product was. It was about recruiting and making sure we got people in to work on the product. You kind of go down any function that isn't in R&D, and I had some hand in trying to figure out how to make that function work to the best of its ability, given what the product was.

(00:40:48):
And now that I lead product, I'm like, "Oh, wow. This is the high order bit." Not that I didn't sort of understand that, but now I really get that product is the high order bit. If you get the product right, it fits in the market, everything else gets easier. Finance is easier, sales is easier, marketing is easier, recruiting is easier, everything gets fucking easier. So I think the other joy of leading the product function is that I get to set the highest order bit in the business's success to one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:22):
This is really great to hear. A lot of times people outside product don't understand these sorts of things and look down on product a lot of times, especially sales folks, COOs a lot of times. I love that you're seeing this and realizing this and recognizing just how important and interesting and challenging this work is and just how awesome PMs are. As you know, a lot of people are a very anti-product manager. "Why do we need product managers? We don't need them. Slow everything down, all this process."

Matt MacInnis (00:41:51):
Yeah. I have a distinction there, which is that I'm anti-shitty product managers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):
That's exactly how I put it. If you hate product managers, you just haven't worked with a great product manager.

Matt MacInnis (00:41:58):
Well, it's like, look, I love wine, wine's one of my things. And I've learned a lot about wine. And one of my favorite lines is like, "I don't like Chardonnay." And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no. Chardonnay's are the most fucking amazing varieties of wine in the world. You just haven't had good Chardonnay. And there's a Chardonnay out there for you." Product management, it's like you don't like product management, you think product managers suck. It's like, well, you just haven't had a good Chardonnay yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:22):
That's exactly what I [inaudible 00:42:24]-

Matt MacInnis (00:42:24):
Once you have one, you can't unlearn it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:26):
You're like, "Let's find that PM ASAP."

Matt MacInnis (00:42:30):
No, let's find that Chardonnay ASAP.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):
[inaudible 00:42:34] with some Chardonnay. You touched on this product market fit point, and I want to double down on this thread. You've had a couple really interesting experiences of struggling to find product market fit with your own startup. You said you worked on it for nine years, you said?

Matt MacInnis (00:42:47):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:47):
Okay. And then with Rippling, complete opposite, extreme product market fit, up and to the right. What's something you've learned about just that that you think people maybe don't understand about what it feels like, what it takes to get to product market fit, how things change?

Matt MacInnis (00:42:59):
There's a line that this venture capitalist, whose name I will not mention, said, which was that product market fit is a sort of thing where you absolutely know it when you see it, and therefore if you don't absolutely know it, you don't have it.

(00:43:17):
And this kind of gets back to my point about learning from mistakes versus successes. It's like, ah, man, over and over again, over the course of the many years that I spent at Inkling, we thought we had it. We thought we had product market fit, maybe, maybe. And in hindsight, with the benefit of now having experienced solid product market fit, it was so, so obvious that we didn't.

(00:43:45):
And I've invested in like 60 companies or 70 companies. I don't know, it's not something I actively do. But opportunities, by virtue, I think, of my role at Rippling, sort of show up. And I talk to lots of entrepreneurs and I love it and I find it super stimulating and I love the fresh ideas and it's just something I do as a real cherry on top of the sport that I play already. But when I get the investor updates for the guys who've been at it for like three, four years and I read the updates from them that I sent to my investors in 2011 and 2012, I'm kind of heartbroken.

(00:44:29):
We talk in Silicon Valley about never quit, but that is complete absolute venture capital bullshit. The incentive of venture capitalist is to put money into your company and milk you dry. They never get their money back. There is no way for them to take that investment back. So the only logical desire that they would have is for you to keep trying against all odds because there is the occasional example where someone pivoted from A to X and it was wildly different and it worked. Slack was originally some sort of a gaming company and became corporate chat. Airbnb maybe. It's like there's some examples of companies having made wild pivots and succeeded, but man, is that rare. Just so exceedingly rare.

(00:45:21):
And I think it's important to remember, I'm 45 years old, we're going to be on the planet, the average age of a man in the United States when he dies is something in the mid 70s. I got 20, 30, maybe if I'm lucky, 40 years left on the planet. Very conscious of the time that I have. And I don't regret what I did at Inkling, I learned a lot. It informed what I do now. I don't think the chapter I'm in right now could have come without the chapters before it. So it's a beautiful, wonderful thing that I did what I did. But when I read the investor update and I'm like, "You're where I was and you are not getting out of this."

(00:45:56):
The Silicon Valley try until you die mindset is not pro-entrepreneur, it's pro-venture capitalist. And I know why that is, but I think it's important to say out loud that you should fucking quit. You should reset the clock, you should reset the cap table because trust me, product market fit when it arrives is insane and it's exciting and you should pursue it. And never delude yourself into believing you have it when you don't. It is dangerous and regrettable. How's that for a speech?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:33):
Beautiful. The anti-VC speech. The-

Matt MacInnis (00:46:38):
I got more where that came from. By the way, it's not anti-VC. It's anti-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):
VC propaganda.

Matt MacInnis (00:46:45):
Everybody's acting in accordance with their incentives in Silicon Valley, the executives, the founders, the venture ... Everybody's, of course, behaving in accordance with their incentives. And the venture capitalists have very strong enduring incentives that have shaped the dynamic of how Silicon Valley works. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just really, really important to point them out and scream at them for the 25-year-old entrepreneur who has no fucking clue how this stuff works.

(00:47:12):
Trust me, the 45-year-old entrepreneur or the 50-year-old venture capitalist who've been in the game for a while, they get it. They've observed it. They know what it's like. The system is there to take advantage of the people who don't, or at least it is the easiest prey for the incentive structures, not for venture capitalists as individual people who are beautiful and all of them are just really wonderful people. It's just that the incentive structures lead to some real harm, I think, in certain cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:37):
And the thing I find is when you do quit, VCs ... I'm always just like, "Hey, let me know when you're starting your next thing. I'm excited to invest." They're rarely, unless they're not a great VC, rarely are they just pissed at you for how could you possibly not make this work [inaudible 00:47:52].

Matt MacInnis (00:47:52):
That's the thing, as a founder, when it's time to throw in the towel on your business and you're so obsessed with giving money back to the cap table, I always remind the entrepreneur like, "Hey, if you're in the seed investing game, your forecast is zero. Your assumption on every investment is that it's going to go to zero." Any seed investor who doesn't take that stance is off their rocker anyway. They're a very bad investor. Seek investors who play the long game, who want to be in your second and third company and are willing to take a bet on the first one and let it go to zero so that you can get on with stuff. This is like, I've had that conversation many times.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:28):
This episode is brought to you by GoFundMe Giving Funds, the zero-fee donor-advised fund. I want to tell you about a new DAF product that GoFundMe just launched that makes year-end giving easy. GoFundMe Giving Funds is the DAF or donor-advised fund supported by the world's number one giving platform and trusted by over 200 million people. It's basically your own mini foundation, without the lawyers or admin costs. You contribute money or appreciated assets like stocks, get the tax deduction right away, potentially reduce capital gains, and then decide later where you want to donate. There are zero admin or asset fees, and you can lock in your deductions now and decide where to give later, which is perfect for year-end giving. Join the GoFundMe community of over 200 million people and start saving money on your tax bill, all while helping the causes that you care about most. Start your giving fund today at gofundme.com/lenny. If you transfer your existing DAF over, they'll even cover the DAF pay fees. That's gofundme.com/lenny to get started. This begs the question of just when is it time to quit? If people hearing this might be like, "Oh man," what are some signs that, okay, it's time to wrap it up?

Matt MacInnis (00:49:38):
Here, look, history provides us with a clear guide. When you look at companies having hit it big, they hit big pretty quick. It's very, very dangerous to be late to the party, it's very, very dangerous to be early to the party, and the vast majority of the time, that's the problem. Rippling, had it been started in 2014, would not be what it is today. I think Rippling, had it been started today, would not be what-

Matt MacInnis (00:50:00):
...Not be what it is today. I think Rippling, had it been started today, would not be what it is five years from now today, and so I think timing is a lot and it's very hard to control for, but when you get the timing right and the market is real and the product works, product market fit, like I said earlier, it's super clear, and so if I were to pick a number out of a hat just from my lived experience, I think it's very important, one aside, don't ask people for advice, ask people for relevant experience. If you ask them for advice, they will always give it, but if you ask them for relevant experience, they rarely have any to offer, and if they don't have any to offer, then don't ask for their advice.

(00:50:41):
So ask people for relevant experience, and I try to do this with my own entrepreneurs when I work with them, it's like, let me offer you whatever relevant experience I have, and my relevant experience on this topic of when to quit is like, I think we could have called it after the second or third pivot, which was somewhere around year four. It is of course very important to believe in what you're building and to be persistent, but there is definitely no shame in saying, "Look, we've pivoted once or twice. It's not catching. I got to go do the next thing," and I think if you're year four, year five in your entrepreneurship journey, and it's not just obviously a screaming rip-roaring growth story, it's extraordinarily difficult. This is so extremely rare. So beyond even already the rare scores you're going to face from the outset that now is going to convert to something crazy. So that's hard to hear, I guess, but man, it can be really liberating when you're like, "Fuck it, I'm going to do this. I have the energy. I'm going to do it again. I'm just going to do it with a clean sheet."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:48):
That is really helpful. You have this really fun way of describing product market fit around receptors and drugs.

Matt MacInnis (00:51:54):
Oh yeah. Yeah. I think this is a really fundamentally misunderstood dynamic. When founders message me and they're like, "Hey, like my LinkedIn post and my tweet for this launch," I do it. I retweet it, I like it, whatever. Nobody follows my Twitter anyways, it doesn't matter, but I do that, but I think to myself, this is not what this is about. This is not how great companies are built. It can be a nucleating event, but it's not a major thing, because nobody cares about your company. Your launch doesn't matter. Big, fat, pull the slingshot back, launches amount to the teeniest thimble of water in the ocean of noise about startups and companies, and so you just got to build it brick by brick bottom up, and these launches don't really amount to much, and so how do you think about that? How do you think about the insignificance of your launch or you think about all the effort you're putting into building a product that you believe is going to have product market fit?

(00:52:56):
Well, if you recognize that the market is immutable, no amount of tweeting, LinkedIn posting, advertising is going to change whether the market wants your product. It might raise awareness about your product, but it's not going to change whether somebody wants it. Then you take a different mindset. You have to view your startup as running an experiment in the universe to see what you get in return for that, and this analogy of drug discovery and binding receptors is like nobody at Genentech thinks they can market their way to better performance inside your body. The binding receptors for that drug, they exist or they don't, and when they build their product, their goal is to find out whether the binding receptors exist, but fate already has decided the outcome. This is absolutely true of every software product you build. Fate has already decided the outcome. The market's either going to latch onto your product and run with it or it's not. Do not ship the product, find a lack of success, and then try to market your way through that, because the binding receptors likely don't exist, and for me, it was a very liberating mindset, because now I just have to find the right drug, and I can forget trying to convince the body to develop the binding receptors for whatever it is that I'm building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:13):
What I love about your advice here is you were an early investor in Notion, which is one of the classic stories of it took them... I think it was four years to get to something. They moved to Japan, they worked on the whole thing, and so is [inaudible 00:54:24] from there? Is that a rare example where it actually worked? And that's not an example to be inspired by, because it's extremely, extremely rare. Let's talk about alpha beta again.

Matt MacInnis (00:54:32):
Okay. As an investor, you might build a checklist of things you want to make sure are true or false about a company and hope that that's going to yield the kind of investment success you're looking for. Does it have this kind of founder? Is it a C Corp in Delaware? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and these checklists are all about what? They're all about suppressing beta. They're about avoiding avoidable mistakes. They're about bringing stability. Jeff Lewis is an investor who has many angular views on things, and I think one of his most enduring phrases is narrative violations. This idea that the common wisdom must be violated in some way by every company that has an outsized success. It is absolutely true, and when I give these general observations on the patterns in Silicon Valley, the most successful businesses inevitably violate something on that list in some really important way.

(00:55:37):
So Notion, you can't replicate Notion's success as an entrepreneur. You can't replicate it because you're not Ivan. You can't replicate it because you're not Notion. You can't replicate it because it's not 2010 when they started the company. Do the math on that. Or 2011, actually. These guys stuck with it. They went through hell. They pivoted. They went to Japan and sat in kimonos and meditated on what they were going to build, and by hook/crook, they got to where they are today as a really wildly successful business in an extraordinarily difficult market where building businesses is virtually impossible in productivity. It is dominated by Google and Microsoft. Carving out your own niche in that market is just unthinkable, and so I look at Notion as having succeeded by virtue of the narrative violation of persistence, I don't think is a good idea for very many people that happen to work for them, and I look at it as being a function of the founding team and their specific idiosyncrasies, the absolute insistence on craftsmanship from Ivan. This is him. That's his thing.

(00:56:55):
The takeaway lesson is not give up or don't give up. The takeaway lesson is certainly not go do what Notion did. The takeaway lesson is that every company succeeds on the foundations of the idiosyncrasies of the founder. The idiosyncrasies of the founder. Rippling succeeds for almost the polar opposite reasons that Notion succeeds, but in both cases, the companies succeed on the idiosyncrasies of the founder, and so embracing that, recognizing those idiosyncrasies, that's what great investors do. They spot that element of spikiness and greatness in a candidate investment, and they convert that to a commitment, and then of course the investor or the good ones accept what they get in exchange from that for the universe, from the universe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:44):
I love that we went in this direction. I wasn't planning to talk about your investing career. Just to give people a reason to listen to this and maybe rewind, and I want to ask another question around investing. What are some other companies you invested in early?

Matt MacInnis (00:57:55):
First of all, okay, so I sort of hate the question. What are some other companies you've invested in? It's a fair question, but the problem is I'm going to give you a bunch of companies I've invested in that won, that are really notable. So what I would like to do instead of answering that question ... Here, let me give you some bait. I was one of the first investors in Notion. I was perhaps the first, I don't know, ask Ivan. Clever, which had a great exit. I was one of the first investors in Zenefits, if you've heard of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:26):
Heard of it.

Matt MacInnis (00:58:27):
I was, before I joined, one of the first investors in Rippling, and then more recently invested in ... Here's a funny one. I was one of the first investors in Deal, if you've heard of them.

(00:58:43):
I was able to exit that position, and then hopefully that company's going to zero with their criminal behavior, but whatever, but more recently, if you know Decagon, which is doing some really cool stuff on the AI front.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):
Killing it.

Matt MacInnis (00:59:00):
I'm in laying chain. Great. So those are some companies that you maybe have heard of, but how about I invested in Macro. Founder was Derek Lee. Macro's out of business. I invested in Debrief, Ned Rockson. It's out of business. I invested in Verb Data with David Hertz out of business. I'm reading from a list. I invested in... What's the number? 70 companies according to this list where I track things and most of them went to zero and all those founders were awesome, all those founders were kick, and all those founders put a ton of energy into building their businesses, and they went to zero and they're enduring relationships.

(00:59:37):
I can call on any of those people, I think, maybe with the exception of Deal, and call in a favor and have... and I've got a few subsequent... and actually a lot of them joined Rippling, believe it or not. So I don't know. Companies I've invested in is a long list, and I love to give you names of companies that don't exist anymore because it's self-serving and a horrible survivorship bias to just list the good ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:00):
I love that answer. I think you're being modest in the context of your hit rate is clearly very high. Even one or two incredibly successful companies out of 70 is a win in VC, and so you're doing very well, but I think that's a really important perspective. When you see people's logos on their websites of all the companies they've invested in, you have no idea how many hit bats they've had.

Matt MacInnis (01:00:22):
I think it's good practice to ask people to give you the full list. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:24):
What are your favorite failures that you've invested in?

Matt MacInnis (01:00:29):
Oh, no. I'm not actually... Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:31):
Well, obviously, no, we don't need spend time on it, but I think it's actually a really good question, but yeah, what are some of your best failed investments? Show me the logos of the companies that didn't work out.

Matt MacInnis (01:00:39):
It's a juicy question. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):
There's a topic around this area that I wanted to spend time on, and I haven't heard anyone think of things this way, which is this idea you talk about of compounding plus power law plus entropy and how that's a really useful frame to think about business.

Matt MacInnis (01:00:58):
So you kicked this conversation off sort of invoking the extraordinary outcomes, demand, extraordinary efforts line, hat tip to Dan Gill, and these are part and parcel. Man, understanding the nature of the universe is a pretty good way to work within it, and so power law distributions happen everywhere. It explains why so few people control so much wealth. It explains why Steph Curry is just so vastly better than the next guy down on the list on the basketball team. It explains why populations are concentrated into a relatively small number of mega cities in the world. It's like, power law distribution just plays out everywhere, and once you see it, you can't unsee it. It sort of plays out in many dynamics.

(01:01:47):
People tend to think that the world plays on a more linear relationship where the X and Y axis are sort of Y equals X, but that is absolutely not the case, and the implications are profound. It's like if you build something to 80 or 90%, the Y axis is barely budged yet. You haven't hit the inflection point in terms of reward, and so the implication of the power law more broadly is that people who are in the top 10%, the top 5%, don't just get 10 or 20% more reward. They get 10X the reward or 100X the reward. It's really dramatic.

(01:02:20):
Entropy, the second law of thermodynamics is a very simple concept. It's the reason your sock drawer becomes messy. It's the reason that potholes form. It's the reason we have to put so much energy into maintaining the aircraft we fly to keep them safe because they really, really, really want to fall apart, and that's the nature of things. If you abandon a city for a few months, it starts to go fallow, and so entropy is just this concept that shit tends toward disorder.

(01:02:48):
The universe, I mean, life itself is a temporary victory against entropy. You and I should not exist. The sun gives energy to the planet. It organizes stuff that we can eat and we fight entropy until we lose the battle somewhere, as I said earlier at the age of 70 or 80, if we're lucky. What does this have to do with product? This is really about effort.

(01:03:17):
The only antidote to entropy, the only antidote to decay in a system is energy. You got to inject energy. So if you have a code base, every line of code that you add to that code base increases the entropy of that system and demands ever more energy from human beings to go and intend to it to make sure it doesn't break, and if you want to achieve greatness, if you want an extraordinary outcome, and in particular, if you want to be in the top 10%, top 5% on the X axis so that the Y axis is through the roof, then you have to relentlessly inject energy at every single step of the game. Teams will, sadly, but because we are all human, teams will always optimize for local comfort over company outcomes.

(01:04:11):
Not because they get together and think, "We should do that," although unions do do that unequivocally, deliberately, but even in a collection of product managers or engineers, what's going to happen over time is entropy is going to creep in and people are going to optimize for local comfort. Your job as an executive, as a leader, is to fight that entropy tooth and nail every single day. It means that every time you see a bug, every time you see a bug, not most of the time, every time you go and you drop it at the feet of the product manager or the engineering manager, every time, in public, preferably, it means that every time someone comes to you to hire someone and says that they have skipped the back channel, every time you're like, "You can't hire this person unless you do the back channel," it means that when you get into the board and tired zone on any process, that you as the executive have got to demand the 99th percentile of energy, because otherwise entropy creeps in and the system decays. You have to do this.

(01:05:19):
One of the messages that I delivered recently at our big executive big... Like our top 75 manager offsite that we do roughly every 18 months, was a reminder that if the purest form of ambition and the purest and most intense source of energy in the business is the founder CEO, that every next concentric circle of management beyond the founder CEO has the potential to be an order of magnitude drop off in intensity, and that is dangerous because if you go to two layers and it's two orders of magnitude drop off and signal and intensity, that is a very dysfunctional organization. So what I say to the team was, it's not that you need to buffer people from the intensity of the CEO, it's that you need to absolutely mirror that intensity.

(01:06:13):
There are plenty of constituents in the business around you who will advocate for relaxing. There is an infinite supply of people under you who will buffer other team members from the intensity of the demands. Your job is not to be one of those buffers. Your job is to preserve that intensity at its highest possible level and let the buffering happen somewhere else, and that's the point is that entropy creeps into the system insidiously and slowly over time off your radar and you have to maintain that intensity every minute of every day to try and fight it if you want to stay at the extreme right end of the power law that obviously governs the outcome of everything that we build.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:03):
What does that look like to pass along that intensity? What does that feel like? What does that look like? So say Parker comes to you, "This bug sucks. I got this broken screen." You cut off your finger. Maybe that's the example.

(01:07:18):
Okay. Still got them. I got all 10.

Matt MacInnis (01:07:21):
I'll give you concrete examples. Actually, the joke that I sort of played on this one when I presented to the team was that the next sort of slide in my presentation was with the sound effect, the Slack huddle thing, and Parker's icon in Slack is just, he uses the generic yellow...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:42):
The egg?

Matt MacInnis (01:07:43):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:43):
Oh, wow.

Matt MacInnis (01:07:46):
It's funny, and so everybody knows the yellow egg is Parker, and so the next slide in the presentation was boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, which is the sound that Slack makes when someone calls you, and it was Parker Conrad is inviting you to a huddle, and then the next slide was Parker Conrad is modeling personal intensity, and the idea is that if you know, you know, if you've ever been dragged into an... "I want to talk about this fucking problem right now and whatever you're doing, unless it's an interview, I want you to come and have a conversation with me."

(01:08:13):
That intensity is one place where it plays out. Every product team at Rippling, and we have a lot of them now, have public feedback channels. I am in there upside down on everything I find when I use those products, and I just model for everybody that this is how at least I want to do it, which is, "I don't like this. I don't understand this. Tell me why this is this way." Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and people jump in and respond. The factory inspection process that I mentioned, which is where at the end of the assembly line, I jump out with the pickle and we talk about all of the elements. You have to record a loom of every major flow through the product. I personally review every one of those flows, I got a backlog I got to catch up on today and provide feedback to people always in a public channel so that every other product manager and engineering manager can jump in and see how the process has worked for other teams.

(01:09:01):
It's about modeling the intensity publicly so that other people can say, "Okay, this is how we do things around here," and it gives the reaction from the team that received the message that you have to inject that energy every minute of every day and that there are no exceptions, was not like, "Ooh, that's exhausting." The reaction is, "Oh, that is so invigorating." It's so wonderful to hear that we're going to achieve these great outcomes, or at least we have a shot at doing so, and that you're empowering me to follow my instinct, which is to really push for the best result.

(01:09:39):
The reaction universally is like, "Ugh, what a relief that I get to go be intense," because nobody in a position of leadership wants to be chill, and what's worse than a chill boss? No, don't work for a chill boss. Don't be a chill boss. It's the most pejorative label I could give you. Chill boss or chill PM. Don't be chill. Chill doesn't accomplish shit. Be intense. Be good, be respectful, be intense. Don't be chill.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:09):
Again, this advice comes from where we started, which is this is what success looks like, because somebody that is less chill than you is going to find that crack and come after your market. Is that the gist?

Matt MacInnis (01:10:21):
For sure. I mean, again, if you're chill and you move the X axis down 10 or 20 points, the Y axis collapses. It doesn't just drop 10 or 20%. The Y axis collapses, and this is just kind of true in everything we do. So yeah, if you want to win, you should probably try.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:45):
This is what I always say to people trying to build lifestyle businesses. There's always this idea, "I'm going to build a side business, I'm going to make recurring income, it's going to be amazing," and in my experience, anytime there's a market or something shows up that's juicy and there's ways to make money, somebody's going to come at you and work harder, raise more money, and there's only so long you can maintain that.

Matt MacInnis (01:11:04):
Well, man, there's a whole other podcast episode on the concept of leverage. If you sell your time, you've only got 24 hours a day to give, but if you can create a product that scales, the marginal cost of a unit of that product is zero like software, it's going to be competitive, man. Sell your time, it's not going to be super competitive, but achieve that level of leverage and it's a pretty efficient market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):
To close out this thread of intensity and adding energy to everything, something I've heard about you is you're big on escalating. You're a big fan of escalating issues, and also you always tell people to never not give you negative feedback, to always share feedback to not hide anything. Tell me about those two.

Matt MacInnis (01:11:49):
Fundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. Who are you optimizing for when you do that? What are you optimizing for when you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable? Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort and it's fundamentally selfish. It's the most selfish thing you could possibly do, is withhold feedback that would otherwise be useful to someone because you don't want to be uncomfortable. Well, that's not how high performance teams operate. So I demand feedback, and I give it, and it doesn't mean that when I give feedback, it's not open to being questioned or discussed. I mean, of course it is, but when I observe something, I try to say it. That's the feedback topic.

(01:12:35):
The part of this that has been interesting to me is that people withhold, escalate, the customers withhold. Customers don't want to escalate to me as an executive. Even the founders in whose businesses I've invested who use Rippling are reluctant to hit me up when something goes wrong because they don't want to bother me, but it's literally my job, literally my job to find things, problems, and make them better, and by virtue of making those specific things better, to iterate on the processes so that the system that builds the system can get better.

(01:13:09):
There's no greater gift to me as a product executive than receiving an escalation from a customer. We have an escalations team at Rippling, which sounds weird, but it's people who are just particularly skilled at pistol whipping other people in the company to get to real root causes, real root causes. Not like throw away the word root cause, like, "Oh, we fixed the data error and shut the ticket down." No, you went and you found the software that created the data error, and then you found the system that created the software that created the data error, and you solved all of that back to the top.

(01:13:44):
Escalation seems extremely good at that at Rippling. So we have sort of a dedicated little team that does this for us. Escalations are a gift, and it's like, if you're a listener right now on this podcast and you are a Rippling customer and you have shit that you think we should know, the fact that I might already know it is not a reason for you to withhold the gift of your feedback. So it's an attitude that I take to this every day. I've got a little cue of some stuff that I've... Minor things that are from the last couple of days from people who had some knits and issues that I'm just like, I've got them queued up on my to do list today and I'm going to take them to the product teams directly and be like, "I'd like to understand what happened here." Not in a negative way. I just think we'll all get better if we study this one, and so yeah, escalations are a gift, feedback like that is a gift, and nobody is ever inconveniencing me when they do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):
For people that are listening to this and feeling like, "Man, this is so stressful and intense and just like, I don't know if I want to work this way," give them a sense of just how successful Rippling is. I think a lot of people may not even have heard of Rippling. A lot of people are like, "Yeah, it's doing great." What are some things you can share that are public or not public that give people a sense of just how massive this business has become?

Matt MacInnis (01:14:53):
People look at Rippling from the outside, I think they think of us as payroll and HR or whatever, which is cool. It's a bit like saying Microsoft is a desktop operating system company or it's like every company starts from somewhere.

Matt MacInnis (01:15:00):
... system company or ... It's like every company starts from somewhere and grows out from there. We see ourselves as building the most successful business software platform in history. In fact, that's the mission statement of our product organization under the umbrella of the mission statement of the company, which is to free smart people to work on hard problems. And when you translate that from where we are today to where we think we're taking things, it's like we really do believe that the core of every workflow and everything that a company has to do, be it AI or manual traditional GUI based software, is who's doing stuff, who owns it, who's accountable? And so the people record is a really important component of that. You can argue that the customer record's also very important. And of course some big businesses have been built on that primitive as well, but we think the people primitive is actually much more important.

(01:15:43):
And that the only thing that hasn't been done here is somebody hasn't been ambitious enough to build a good business on top of that primitive. Workday is terrible software. Everybody agrees on that. I think Workday agrees on that. Good luck to them. But they have failed actually, despite their success, to build a really broad general purpose software platform for business software on the foundation of the people primitive. So we're going to do that.

(01:16:03):
And we're successful because we deliver on that promise at the scale we're at today. The fact that you can do ... and this is not a sales pitch or sort of like an advertisement for Rippling. I just think it's important to sort of contemplate that when you bring together a bunch of disparate business processes into one system on a common business data graph, an object graph, a data lake with a consistent interface, you can do some pretty magical things.

(01:16:27):
So we do payroll, we do HCM, we do IT, we do spend. We are about to launch a new product in the category of business intelligence and data management. And there's a whole bunch of other stuff coming beyond that. And then you layer in AI on top of this, where we alone, where we alone have all of your business data organized into this nice, neat package with a beautiful semantic layer on top of it. The AI can work magic. And we have shipped nothing, nothing yet in this category that I would say gets anywhere near what we're going to show next year. And it is going to set the standard. It is going to be the most ... The back flips that the AI is doing reading and writing data for the user just on our internal use cases at Rippling is jaw dropping. So I'm super excited about the tailwind this is going to create for us.

(01:17:20):
You ask about what can I share about the success of the company? What I can say, there are tens of thousands of companies that now run on Rippling. We're less than 1% of the market. And the market cap at 16 billion, I think now undervalues where we are from a revenue perspective by a long shot. There is just so much upside to do what we're doing. And SaaS might be dead-ish in terms of point solutions, but long live SaaS in terms of what we're building.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:48):
Let me follow that thread in AI. There's been a lot of talk about AI is going to replace SaaS, as you maybe just said.

Matt MacInnis (01:17:55):
Yeah. People are going to vibe code their way to their payroll system, which I ... good luck to the employees of those companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):
And so what I'm hearing here is that you actually do believe a lot of SaaS companies that are selling individual solutions are in big trouble. The answer implied here is this kind of compound startup idea of you need to do a lot of things for people for them to continue to pay for your software. Is that the gist?

Matt MacInnis (01:18:18):
No. I think the gist is ... there's a really good quote. I forget who it's attributable to, but it's, "There's two ways to make money in software, bundling and unbundling." And you just got to get the timing right. So this is a period of bundling. So here's the problem; point solutions don't have enough data in the age of AI to be useful. You got to be able to provide the AI with a lot of context about a lot of data so it can do things. It can do joins. It can do correlations.

(01:18:49):
And so if you're a point solution, you're in hard water because you've got to now rely on data from other sources. You've got to integrate to third party systems. And when you integrate to a third party system, even the best ones are still sort of drinking their data through a straw, which is a real problem. I mean, the biggest HCM software company you can think of integrates to the other biggest payroll software company you can think of through flat files via SFTP. What are they going to do? What are they going to do? It's just never going to work. It's just no way. And so I literally have no idea what they're going to do. They're just not going to build AI software, I guess. Point SaaS is sort of in a rough spot, especially when you cleave two really important systems apart and say they have to integrate. It's very, very hard.

(01:19:39):
The other thing that I would say about the world of, even just like not SaaS, but AI software is that point solutions in the AI world are also in a rough spot for the same reason. It's like if you're selling the shovels like OpenAI and Google with Gemini, you can make money. And if you own the mine, like Rippling, with the data, you can make money. If you're somewhere in the middle, building AI software that then tries to use the shovels from the shovel provider, but then also needs to rent out the mine, or get the ore out of somebody else's mind and start refining it, you're in a very difficult place from an economic standpoint. Because you're not going to be permitted by either of those parties to build a big business on their backs.

(01:20:25):
That's just not how it's going to work. They're going to demand value capture that crushes your unit economics. So I look at the landscape of AI companies that I've seen and I think you have to have a really durable, interesting insight that gives you a shot at viable unit economics to be an interesting business. And that is going to kill off 80 or 90% of the stuff that I see right now as standalone AI businesses.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:53):
So what I'm hearing here ... I love that you correct me when I get these things wrong, and that's exactly what I want. What I'm hearing is it's less about how difficult it is to build the SaaS product. It's about, do you have first party data that allows you to build an incredible AI product on top of what you've got?

Matt MacInnis (01:21:09):
Yep. Because look, SaaS software is a bit flipping. All SaaS software applications are bit flippers. It's an interface changing-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:09):
Your database?

Matt MacInnis (01:21:18):
Yeah. Changing values in your database, that's what it does. It's a really hard problem. One of Rippling's superpowers is we're a coin sorter. You dump $20,000 for an employee in the top of the coin sorter, and it figures out what goes to the government, what goes to health insurance, what goes to your 401k, what goes to you. And it has to move all that money very, very reliably and seamlessly, very challenging software to build and manage. What's it doing? Even that is just flipping bits in a database. And so AI is a new way to flip bits. AI is just a new way to flip bits. Hopefully a way that abstracts us a little bit further from having to think because our future is Wally. It's going to be great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:57):
Speaking of Wally, actually, I have this Matic Robot. You have one of these?

Matt MacInnis (01:22:04):
Uh-huh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:05):
No. It's like a self-driving car robot, basically, a self-driving car. People built this robot that cleans your house. Maybe I didn't mention that. It's like a house cleaning robot that just goes around.

Matt MacInnis (01:22:15):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:15):
It's like a Roomba. You should have one. They're expensive, but incredibly cool. And actually in Wally, there's a scene where they actually have basically what these things look like. So it's not so far-fetched for that movie.

Matt MacInnis (01:22:26):
I definitely was actually quite prescient, perhaps with the exception of the gravity defying day beds.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:33):
Yeah. I don't know, but that's not good news. You've seen that movie. Oh, man. So on this AI stuff, which I'm hearing is we're going to see a lot more consolidation where these point solution companies realize they need this data. This is existential, and they're going to combine and merge and bundle, as you described?

Matt MacInnis (01:22:51):
It's possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:52):
Or for now.

Matt MacInnis (01:22:52):
I am not an investigator on this stuff. I think there's some really interesting investors out there who I think are thinking quite deeply about this. And in particular, the conviction, which is like Mike Fornell and Sarah Guo. I think those are two investors who are hyper focused on AI. And when they made the decision to take that approach, at the time I thought that's kind of narrow. Now I'm like, no, no, no, that was the right move. And it just means that they have a very deep, deep, deep set of hypotheses that they've formed over the course of seeing every AI deal in the valley. And there are better people to ask this question of than I am. And I think if you're an entrepreneur, I recommend them to you because I think they're really smart.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Awesome. I love those guys. Also, Sarah and Elad have a podcast called No Priors that I'd also recommend. We'll point it to you in the show notes. So on this AI note, I guess is there anything else that you think would be really helpful for founders that are working in this space building an AI startup to hear they think you were seeing of like, here's what you need to do to win in an AI company?

Matt MacInnis (01:23:58):
So much. I actually think that if I were to give you an answer to this question right now, it would be bullshit. Yeah. I don't have anything ... Back to my point earlier, I don't have enough relevant experience in the abstract to dole out on a podcast on that topic, but I wish them luck.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:17):
I love that. Circling back to your advice, don't ask for advice, ask for a relevant experience. And I love that that's where your mind immediately went. I'm going to take us to AI Quarter, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. And the question is just what's one way you've found AI to be useful in your work day-to-day? Is there something that you found it unlocked in how you work?

Matt MacInnis (01:24:37):
I mean, it's not a super exciting thing, but I'll say where I use ... So one of the most important functions that I perform as an executive is the synthesis of ideas, and the ability to communicate those ideas very clearly to people. So when I talk about the product quality list and the pickle, as something that we've come up with internally, I do turn to AI, ChatGPT and Gemini, where I take a really, let's say, angular view of some topic and I give ... really, I write the essay for the AI and I'm like, "Look, this is the crisp idea I want to communicate. Help me come up with pithy ways to articulate these things." And 80% of what it outputs is trash. It's just sort of middle of the road, average, low alpha junk.

(01:25:24):
But it is a thought partner, a non-judgemental thought partner where in 20% of the stuff it comes out with, I'm like, yeah, it's pretty good. That's a new word I didn't think of. That does kind of hit the nail on the head for this concept. And so if I believe that my job is to sort of bring brains along on the journey for some sort of change that I'm trying to bring about, then the most important tool is language. And I do find that the ChatGPT and Gemini do a great job of helping me refine how to articulate the concepts that I want to articulate. They are not useful in coming up with the ideas themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:59):
That's an awesome tip. I don't know if you've played with Claude much, but I actually find Claude is better at writing and words and language.

Matt MacInnis (01:26:05):
I have not spent a lot of time with Claude. I have used it, but by virtue of this conversation, I'll probably go give it a go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:12):
Right. Yeah. They're all great, but there's something about Claude that is just at writing specifically is much better, but they're all getting better all the time. There's always something new.

(01:26:23):
Matt, we've covered so much ground. We've touched on everything I was hoping to touch on. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you were hoping to share or anything else you wanted to touch on or leave listeners with?

Matt MacInnis (01:26:34):
Yeah. We've spent a lot of time talking about intensity and the grind, and the need to just always be operating at the 99th percentile. And I think if you listen to that in a vacuum, it's very easy to believe that that intensity is soul crushing, that it's a negative, that it's maybe not something that you want. And I think there's a backstop for me that I didn't talk about today that I think is important to share, which is that life is amazing. That the fact that we all exist on this blue marble drifting through space and time, that we are some weird instantiation of consciousness, each of us, and that you're here for such a short period of time whittling your stick, doing something, that if you remember how insignificant we are and all of this is, it brings this levity to what we do and to the work we put into building this.

(01:27:47):
Because Silicon Valley in 2025 is Florence and the Renaissance. It's crazy. The amount of creativity and insane invention and progress that's happening for our species right now in this place is absolutely unparalleled in all human history. You've got to zoom out and appreciate that magic. And so then you turn around and you're like, fuck, I've got to work on Friday night, right? I've got to go give it my all. I've got to go compete in the arena of business.

(01:28:22):
You have to never forget that number one, none of this matters. And number two, it is an absolutely beautiful and amazing phenomenon that we get to be alive doing this right now. So play the sport, play it with everything you've got, but never forget that it's just a sport and that none of it matters. I think it's super important as a counterpoint to the intensity that we talked about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:48):
That is beautiful.

Matt MacInnis (01:28:50):
I think about Pale Blue Dot, Carl Sagan's whole thing. Just a stunning photograph that literally changed the way I think about who I am as a person when I saw it. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:02):
Well, going in a completely different direction, with that, Matt, we reached our very exciting lighting round.

Matt MacInnis (01:29:07):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:07):
All right, five questions for you. Are you ready?

Matt MacInnis (01:29:09):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:11):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Matt MacInnis (01:29:16):
Okay. Two or three books. You give me a heads-up on this. So one book is Conscious Business. I don't have Conscious Business in front of me because it's actually at the office because we have Conscious Business Reading Club at Rippling. And every member of my current, my product leadership team is going through this right now, Conscious Business, Fred Kofman. It's been used in many businesses, LinkedIn most notably, as a framework for thinking about ... effectively, it's a user manual for human beings. So if you are a leader, a manager, an executive, whatever, particularly younger people in their 20s and 30s who are just sort of getting the hang of being a CEO or a product leader for the first time, this book is absolute fucking gold. It was recommended to me by Bryan Schreier at Sequoia when he was on my board at my previous company. I took way too long to take him up on the advice, wished I had read it sooner. Highly recommend Conscious Business. Changes your life.

(01:30:01):
Number two, Thinking in Systems, Donna Meadows. I always mispronounce her name, Donella Meadows. She died partway through writing this manuscript. Her fellow professors picked it up and finished it for her. It is the best generic framework for thinking about how systems work. You will extrapolate from this book to every aspect of your life after you read it.

(01:30:23):
And then the third is classic 1960s, The Effective Executive. It's an anachronism. It uses weird pronouns for the secretary and the executive. I'll let you guess which ones. But the book itself is so chock-full of simple enduring advice on how to be effective at leading teams. And the good shit is the stuff that's been in print for 70 years, and that's one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:48):
Beautiful. I love the first one is you don't have it because you're using it with your team constantly. You mentioned at one point before we started recording, you have eight copies of that book that you just give out to everyone.

Matt MacInnis (01:30:57):
Yeah, and we handed out like candy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
Okay. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Matt MacInnis (01:31:03):
Yeah. So I'm a little embarrassed by this answer, but I'm going to be honest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:07):
Please.

Matt MacInnis (01:31:08):
There's a new series called Heated Rivalry and it's about ... I'm Canadian and I'm gay. So it's about two hockey players. In Canada, rivals between the Bruins and the Maple Leafs, although they don't use those names, who are just heated rivals on the ice. And it's a huge thing that the world is watching, but actually they're secretly in love with each other and they start hooking up. And it's been labeled by the media as smutty but delightful. And I would say that's accurate. So it might not be for everybody, but it is a smash hit right now. It's on HBO Max and Crave, and it's only six episodes. But like I said, a little embarrassing because it's a little chintzy, but it's a lot of fun. It's also really fun to see gay people represented in the media as though they're normal, and it's fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:57):
And soon to be on Netflix with the acquisition if that goes through.

Matt MacInnis (01:32:00):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:00):
It's crazy. Amazing. Okay. Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Matt MacInnis (01:32:06):
My Fellow coffee maker. I love my Fellow coffee maker. It's got an interface that lets you set light, medium, dark roast. It changes the temperature. It blooms the coffee. It tells you how many grams of coffee to put into the basket, slick interface, high quality coffee. It's definitely awesome. And so I have Ashley have one in the office and one at home and one in the garage.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:30):
Wow. That is a favorite product. You have three of them in the same cool space.

Matt MacInnis (01:32:30):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:35):
Oh no, in the office. Okay.

Matt MacInnis (01:32:35):
Fellow is also a Rippling customer and that's a nice side effect when we get to ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:39):
Have they ever escalated anything to you?

Matt MacInnis (01:32:42):
No. If you're listening and you're from Fellow, I want to hear all your gripes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:46):
Perfect. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to often in work or in life?

Matt MacInnis (01:32:51):
It's a dark one, and I'll share this one sort of partially for the humor of it, but it's actually sometimes useful immediately. At least it's sort of a moment of smiling when it happens. The motto comes from my dad who said, "Matt, nothing's ever so bad in life that it couldn't get worse." And it's like we were going through some shit yesterday at work and we were like, "Fuck, now that happened." And I looked at the CTO and I'm like, "Dude, nothing's ever so bad that it couldn't get worse." And we had a good laugh and continued to brace for whatever might come next. So not exactly uplifting, but fun to use.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:26):
No, it is uplifting. I'm an optimist and I find myself thinking that often with my wife just like, "It could be worse. It could be worse than this. " Definitely. It's actually [inaudible 01:33:36].

Matt MacInnis (01:33:36):
And it might get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:38):
So let's enjoy this less worse version. Final question. Something you shared with me is that you were a DJ when you were a younger person. Can you just give us a little DJ voice to give people a sense of your skills?

Matt MacInnis (01:33:52):
Well, so first of all, it's not DJ, Lenny. It's radio personality. And yeah, I used to do the greatest hits of all time with hits from the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, and a little bit of the '90s, 101.5 The Hawk. Yeah. You can turn it on. It's very inauthentic, but it sounds good on the radio. It's cool. I did it when I was in high school. I ended up doing the midday segment right before I went to college. And what a gift. What a huge gift in my most formative years to have developed an ability to be in front of a microphone comfortably, because here we are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):
I love for people that weren't watching this YouTube, you lean really close to the mic to get that radio personality voice.

Matt MacInnis (01:34:34):
Yeah, you got to be able to hear the saliva in the mouth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:38):
Incredible, and it's like the same person talking. If you're not watching this, you're like, "Where did that guy come from?" That was great. You nailed it. Matt, this was incredible. I really appreciate being here. I really appreciate you sharing all this advice that I have not heard other people share. Two final questions. Is there something you want to plug, point people to, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt MacInnis (01:34:55):
Look, my life is rippling. I point people there, and this is my life's work. It's going to be a banger, so stay tuned. And the way that you can help me is that if you're a customer, you got to tell me when you have problems, because that's how we get better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:10):
What's the way to get to you? Is there any place you want to point people to?

Matt MacInnis (01:35:13):
DM me on Twitter, is easy @stanine. You can email me my last name at rippling.com, and I'll go that far without giving out my phone number. How's that? Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:25):
A perfect boundary.

Matt MacInnis (01:35:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:27):
Matt, thank you so much for being here.

Matt MacInnis (01:35:29):
It's my pleasure. Thank you for having me, Lenny, and congrats on all the success with this podcast. It's been great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:34):
Same to you. It's always a good sign at the end of a conversation when you're like, oh, I got to get me some of that stock and I got to get into that Rippling.

Matt MacInnis (01:35:41):
It's a good buy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:41):
A great job.

# Building Anchor, selling to Spotify, and lessons learned | Maya Prohovnik (Head of Podcast Product)

## Transcript

Maya Prohovnik (00:00:00):
We were obsessed with reducing friction, this was our constant battle. And so we hired a couple of college interns and we brought them in and we were like, people are going to push this magical one button in the Anchor app and they're going to say, I want to distribute my podcast, and your job is going to be to do all that same manual stuff manually, but to them it's going to feel magical and it happened automatically. I still don't know how many people know this. I think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts, and I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point.

Lenny (00:00:48):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Maya Prohovnik. Maya is Spotify's head of product for podcasting where she oversees product design and engineering teams responsible for building the tools and experiences for podcasters and their listeners. Maya was also employee number one at Anchor, which Spotify acquired five years ago, which became the core of Spotify's podcasting hosting platform, which now powers over 75% of all new podcasts created in the world. In our conversation, we dig into why Maya is obsessed with dogfooding and why she encourages everyone on her team to create their own podcast. She's got four podcasts of her own, which are all very highly rated and people love. We dig into how she stays productive and organized in a very hectic senior leadership role, what she's done to allow for Anchor to continue to operate like a startup within a larger organization.

Lenny (00:01:44):
Also, a bunch of really fun early Anchor stories, including how interns uploaded podcasts to Apple and Spotify manually before they could automate that. Plus, how to find a balance between using your gut and using data to make decisions. Also, public speaking tips, so much more. Maya is amazing and I'm really excited for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Maya Prohovnik after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.

Lenny (00:02:33):
This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted private supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today, jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more.

Maya Prohovnik (00:04:38):
Thank you so much for having me. You and I have been trying to get together for almost a year now.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Oh, man. But it all worked out and it's going to be very worth it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:04:45):
You had a kid. I took parental leave.

Lenny (00:04:47):
Oh, right. That is true. Man, overlapping kid journeys. I also have been just really looking forward to this chat partly because you're amazing and partly because it just feels very meta to have the head of product of Spotify podcasting on the podcast, and I imagine many people are listening to this on Spotify, so there's this, I don't know, turtles all the way down situation happening.

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:08):
I totally agree. I was thinking the same thing when I was preparing for it where it's like so much of what we have to talk about is so meta, and then we also have you and I know each other because you've been sending me feedback about the podcast experience on Spotify, so lots of circular stuff there.

Lenny (00:05:22):
Speaking of Spotify and podcasting, clearly you've done an incredible job building podcasting on Spotify. From what I've read, it's the number one podcasting platform now. Is there a stat you could share by just the percentage of the market share essentially of Spotify podcasting?

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:37):
I think we are now officially over a third of global market share of podcast listening, which is pretty insane.

Lenny (00:05:43):
That is insane.

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:44):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:44):
Also, I think on the hosting side, it's an even bigger number. Is there a stat you can share by just maybe new podcasts that are launched and how many are hosted on Spotify?

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:53):
Yeah, I think at this point it's more than 75% of all new shows on Spotify are hosted with Spotify for podcasters, which used to be Anchor. When we were acquired by Spotify, I think Anchor had already gotten to 40% of all new podcasts or something crazy. So, yeah.

Lenny (00:06:09):
Insane. Okay, so for these reasons, I want to spend the time that we have together unpacking how you operate as a product leader and essentially what you've learned about product org leadership growth and all those things. How's that sound?

Maya Prohovnik (00:06:22):
That sounds perfect. My favorite topics.

Lenny (00:06:24):
Okay, let's do it. So as the first question I asked a PM who actually works for you, Wilma Chu, what to ask you, and the first thing that came to mind for her was this idea of dogfooding and how important dogfooding is to your way of operating as a product leader. As an example, you have three of your own podcasts on Spotify and I checked them out and they're all very highly rated, so they're not just like bullshit podcasts, they're real people actually listen and enjoy them. So my question to you is just why is dogfooding so important to you? How do you actually operationalize it? And then also maybe just talk about these podcasts that you have.

Maya Prohovnik (00:06:58):
Sure. Well, I can talk about them forever, so be careful because I'll take up the whole hour with that. But I actually have four podcasts. There's two that I don't update as much anymore. So my first ever podcast was about Stephen King books. I'm a big Stephen King super fan. So, when I joined Anchor, and we weren't even fully podcasts yet, if you recall, we were something else audio, we were trying to avoid being podcasts for a while and then we decided to just be podcasts. But when I got into audio and trying to help audio creators, the first thing I did was make my own podcast because I was like, I know nothing about production or what it feels to even be a creator in that way.

Maya Prohovnik (00:07:35):
And so I started my Stephen King podcast because that is the number one thing that I just love to talk about every day, which is one of my tips for podcasters. If you're trying to figure out what to make a show about, it's what can you talk about for? So I did that one for a while actually. I spent a ton of time editing it. I spent a ton of time on SEO and marketing it, and it got to the point, I think at its peak I was getting 5,000 listeners in a episode, which now seems small for a podcast, I know.

Lenny (00:07:59):
No, that's very legit.

Maya Prohovnik (00:08:01):
Yeah, for a test podcast that I was just doing to learn how to do my job, I was so excited to get that audience and I fell off because, well, mostly I had a kid, I joined Spotify. My life's really busy and that level of production is so hard to do if it's not your full-time job, but I still get emails all the time from people who are like, please bring it back. I never found another great Stephen King because I really got deep into the books and the connection between the books. So that was one of them. The second one I did, still going today. So my husband and I have this Big Brother podcast, the show Big Brother, it's terrible.

Maya Prohovnik (00:08:33):
I would not recommend listening to my podcast unless you are a Big Brother super fan, and I actually started that one because I wanted to get the other end of the spectrum where something we were really focused on with Anchor at the time was first time creators really growing the pie of podcasters and specifically we had this theory that podcast creation of the future would be mobile first and we had this really high-powered mobile app, and so I was like, I'm going to make a podcast that's fully mobile, not highly edited, not worry about making something that sounds like a traditional podcast. And I really leaned into all the Anchor features. So it's fully recorded on my phone. I do almost no editing, but I think the thing that's kept us going, because it's been six or seven years now we've been doing the show, it's really the community, the people who call in.

Maya Prohovnik (00:09:15):
I have no idea who these people are. I have no idea how they found this terrible show, but they love it. They call in every week. And that I think is one of the many things I've learned from dogfooding, a podcast creation app is that community piece is so important. If you don't know if anyone's listening, if you don't know what they like about it, if you don't know if they're coming back, it's so hard to keep investing the time. And then I made a show, my least known podcast, because it only got like 25 listeners for episode, it's about my favorite book of all time called Children of Time. It's actually a trilogy. And the reason it got almost no listeners is because there were tons of spoilers in the podcast and the book is like 800 pages long. So we were like, do not listen if you haven't read the book.

Maya Prohovnik (00:09:53):
So, it was very niche, but I think it's a really good podcast if you've read Children of Time. And then my last one I just started doing a couple of years ago is about parenting. So I have a son who's two and a half now and we have been documenting our journey as parents all the way from, we went through IVF, so starting with sort of fertility, I have a really fun episode about childbirth if people are interested in that sort of thing. And then ever since then it's just been episodes about the transition to parenthood, which has not been particularly easy for us, and now my son's a toddler, so lots of fun things happening there. You're not there yet, but you will be and then you can listen to my toddler episodes.

Lenny (00:10:27):
Yeah. I got to listen to the next... A few months ahead to learn from what you've learned.

Maya Prohovnik (00:10:31):
Yes, I think that's a good tactic.

Lenny (00:10:33):
Before we talk about dogfooding, have you ever considered going full-time on this stuff? This is always an option for people and clearly you've done great. At least two podcasts are killing it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:10:44):
I have not. And I think it's so funny because with my parenting podcast too, and even my terrible Big Brother podcast, I get compliments all the time and people are like, "I love listening to this." And my husband also is a really funny and a really good podcaster, but I don't know why I don't think of myself as a creator. I think to me it still feels like this exercise where it's like I'm making my podcast, but I'm really doing it so that I can learn about our product and get in the mindset of a creator. So I think the problem is I'm just too much of a product person. It's a means to an end for me instead of the end itself. But that is an interesting question because I know most people who podcasts, their ultimate goal is obviously to be able to do it full-time and that is interesting that I haven't thought about it.

Lenny (00:11:31):
You have a good backup plan of things if anything goes off the rails.

Maya Prohovnik (00:11:34):
I guess so, yeah.

Lenny (00:11:35):
Awesome. Okay. Just coming back to this idea of dogfooding, where does that come from for you? What have you learned about just how to execute that?

Maya Prohovnik (00:11:40):
It's just always been my natural state. I've had a handful of different product jobs and I guess they've all been tangentially related to helping creators or creative people. And so I think for me it's like I don't know how you can build those tools if you don't understand that mindset. I'm not surprised that it came to Wilma's mind when you asked her what to ask me because I am constantly yelling at my product team who do not have podcasts and being like, I really don't think that you can build the right things. If they talk to users all the time, they see the data, but all of them, once they finally start doing their podcast, they're like, I get it. Something clicked and now I feel like I really understand what they need. And I guess building tools for creators is similar to building a B2B product where you really have to understand business, it's their livelihood.

Maya Prohovnik (00:12:25):
And so I think if you're just looking at a list of feature requests, you're not necessarily going to prioritize it in the same way as if you deeply feel those problems. And I think for me, I don't know if I mentioned this to you, but when I first got into tech, I started in customer support, that was how I got into product, and so I think I just am a very user focused product person. I think there's different schools of thought for product and for me it's always been about making people happy, making their experience better, solving real problems in their lives. And so for me, becoming one of the users, I think it's made it so much easier for me to advocate for that being a pretty big chunk of the roadmap.

Maya Prohovnik (00:13:04):
I think if you don't have that, especially coming from someone in leadership, it's so easy to just fall into that trap of like, well, we're working on the next big strategic thing, which is two years away, and then in the meantime your users are getting no value and then they're just going somewhere else. So I don't know. I think it's really important to me. It makes sense to me and also, I'm not sure how else I would do product. I've never really not done it that way. It

Lenny (00:13:25):
Reminds me of Airbnb Brian was a huge advocate on the host side of the product is like, you need to be a host, but many people couldn't because they didn't have a place that could be hosted. Is there anything you've learned about just how to make this a thing that actually works effectively, a way to operationalize this for people listening, they're like, "Oh, I should start encouraging my team to do?"

Maya Prohovnik (00:13:42):
I'm constantly reminding our team to do this. And then I think that also comes from the other people who are doing it. So we really elevate the people on our team who have their own podcasts, we help them tell their stories internally. Whenever we do an offsite or any team activity, we'll always incorporate podcast creation or some way of making sure everyone on the team is using the tools. I don't know, I think a lot of it just comes from, I'm so vocal about this stuff. The other night I was recording a podcast and I DMed one of the engineers on our team and told him about this tiny little iOS bug and he was like, why are you DMing me about this at nine o'clock at night? I think I was also supposed to be on vacation, I can't remember.

Maya Prohovnik (00:14:20):
But then he got the bug fix the next day. And so I do think making that something that's really top of mind for the team that we do need to fix problems, that these things matter, I don't know. I always listen to the podcast that my team makes, so it's like I know they're going to get at least one listener. And then I think also I try, I think because I understand a big part of building tools for podcasters is understanding all the barriers to entry. It's actually a really difficult thing trying to get someone to put their voice out there, share their story, it's a really emotional journey. And so I feel like I've tried to turn some of the things that I've learned about podcasting into, I've never written it down, maybe I should, but I have a playbook that I'll tell people when they're considering making their own podcast.

Maya Prohovnik (00:15:02):
So it's just things like don't try and record by yourself, find a friend. That's a much easier way to get into it or don't follow a script because then you're going to feel really awkward and uncomfortable and not feel good about it afterwards. Or don't just record a test thing for 30 seconds and publish it because you have to make yourself feel the pain that we're trying to understand in our users.

Lenny (00:15:24):
What's cool about that that could turn into just onboarding education, basically your experience of making a podcast informs how to help new podcasters become successful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:15:31):
Totally, yeah. And also this is less about dogfooding, but one of my favorite things is I'm always just trying to convince everyone I meet to start a podcast, that's just become my annoying thing. And so if I'm interviewing someone for a job or if I'm at a party and mingling with people, it's like somehow the conversation always turns to their passions and then I'm like, you should make a podcast about it. And then they're like, well, I can't. And then I work my way through all the reasons they say they can't do it, and then they go start a podcast. So I'm like one person at a time.

Lenny (00:16:00):
I see how you're growing the platform now.

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:02):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:16:04):
Very unscalable, hands to hand combat at parties. I get it. Okay. One thing you mentioned about being maybe the only listen of your coworkers podcast reminds me there's this platform where you could find Spotify music that has never ever been played once and you could be their first play and just go through.

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:22):
That is so cool.

Lenny (00:16:24):
It's very touching, right?

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:25):
Yes. I haven't seen that and now I'm like, how can we productize that for podcasters? That's such a cool thing.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Anyway, another area that I've heard you're really strong at and came up with Wilma and a few other people I talked to is you find a really good balance between being very data-driven and also very gut driven, and this is something a lot of product leaders try to get better at. And so I'm curious just what have you learned about try to find that balance and also is there an example of something where you went against the data and went with your gut and it worked out.

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:58):
If you remember the old days of the internet, I feel like there was really this different way of thinking about product development where it was so much more about what felt good and what made you feel something as a user in that product. And so it's like we used to be a lot more playful I think with software. I think we used to put a lot more emphasis on things like delightful animations or fun little Easter eggs, and I am not sure when or where that got lost, but it feels like product management as a role has gotten formalized and become a little bit more scientific, I'm generalizing, but I think a lot of product managers can be so focused on using the right frameworks and making sure that they have the right roadmap and all of this stuff.

Maya Prohovnik (00:17:37):
And then it's like you find yourself in this cycle where you're just building things to build them and not really thinking about the connection to the end user. I think data is amazing and I'm like, we have such an incredible insights team at Spotify, both my insights team and then the broader one. I think we are so lucky and we have so much knowledge about our users and different cohorts and what people need and what they're missing, and so I think that's extremely valuable. I think where people get into trouble is when they think that they can rely solely on the data. And so what I spend a lot of time talking to my team about is how we can balance that. So thinking about, I guess a couple general things I would say are there are right and wrong times I think for both for your gut and for data. And then there are lots of different kinds of data and different ways to use that data.

Maya Prohovnik (00:18:21):
So I think when you're in the trap of just being like, well, this is the process we always have with insights and we're just going to run this every time we have a feature, I don't think you're going to have a great time. I think if you think of it as part of the creative process as a PM where you're like, I have a hypothesis, I have some data that is helping me understand that hypothesis in the first place or form it in the first place, then I'm going to do some user research and try a couple of things and see what works for people. Then I'm going to make sure that we have success metrics and that we know what we're looking for when we launch, then we're going to follow, et cetera. So I think there's different times and places for all the different types of data collection that you can do.

Maya Prohovnik (00:18:58):
The other thing I would say is something that I have had to learn as a leader, especially as part of a larger organization, when we were a startup Anchor was like 20 people when we got acquired by Spotify. And by the way, Spotify is my first big tech company, so I've always been at startups, so I've learned a lot about that. But when I was leading product at a startup, it's like we're a small team, we're really focused on moving quickly. There isn't a whole lot of stopping to ask what data is supporting this or it's just like we talked to some users and we're like, great, that's a problem. We're just going to go and fix it. And I think at Spotify there's obviously at places like Spotify, I mean, large organizations, there's obviously a lot more people that you need to coordinate.

Maya Prohovnik (00:19:38):
There's a lot of people you have to influence that aren't on your immediate team. And so I think something that I've had to learn is that being gut driven isn't the same as just saying to people, I told you or I believe this, so you have to do it. There really is an art I think to balancing that. And I think that what I try to do is always still as objectively as possible explain why my gut is feeling that way. So it's like you can refer back to your years of experience or other things that you've done that have been similar. You can talk about your experience as a user testing this stuff. You can bring in stories and anecdotes from users to help back it up. And so I have found that that works obviously a lot better.

Maya Prohovnik (00:20:18):
And I think that in the times that either I have done this or I've seen other leaders do it, where they're just like, well, we're just going to do it this way even if you guys don't agree or if the data says something different, those projects are always immediately doomed from the beginning. They're never going to work. You can't drag all these people through something that they don't believe in. So I think I would think of your gut actually as a type of data and I think it's a totally valid one and it's just I think you need to be clear that that's what you're working with, but then it should be taken as seriously as any other data point. So I try and think of it that way where it's like this should all ideally work together. And obviously the more data you have and the more types of data you have, the more convincing you're going to be and the more right you're going to be.

Maya Prohovnik (00:20:56):
So I think it all helps. There were so many of these in the early days of Anchor because I don't even know, I don't think we had a data scientist until we were part of Spotify, so I think it was just engineers running queries. But there were a couple times where we had to move Anchor from 1.0 to 2.0 and then from 2.0 to 3.0, we did these big, I don't like to call them pivots, but sort of evolutions let's say, of our product or our strategy terminology also very important when you're trying to convince people of things. So when I was thinking about those big transitions for us as a team, I think both times we had these big moments with our teams where we had to get everyone on board with making these big changes. So with Anchor 1.0, I don't know if you remember, but it was actually similar to what Clubhouse I think just rebranded to more voice messaging and short form and more about connections between people.

Maya Prohovnik (00:21:50):
And that was the first thing we ever launched and people loved it. People were very excited about it, the data was all good. We had extremely retained users. We anecdotally, we were hearing all this stuff from users all the time that they were staying up all night to use the app, people were meeting each other and falling in love and getting married on our platform, all of these really kind of magical things and we were seeing the user base was growing consistently. But I think we had this feeling, and when I say, I mean, mostly Mike and I at the time, Mike was our CEO, that it just wasn't ever going to be big enough. And so we had this really interesting moment where the users were all telling us, there's no problem. We love this product. They were using it every day, they were coming back. It was slowly growing and we were just like, this just isn't going to get us to where we need to be, our original goal had been we wanted to democratize audio.

Maya Prohovnik (00:22:42):
We wanted to make it something where anyone could easily tell their story, and we were like, if we keep digging ourselves into this niche that a small number of people really, really love, that's great, but that's not really the mission that we sent out set out to solve. And so the 1.0 to 2.0 transition was I think actually pretty painful because for all of those people who had been invested in 1.0, 2.0 didn't work for them. 2.0 was much more about content creation and making more of a radio station, and it was less about telling your personal story and close relationships and more about projecting and using different tools. Anyway, so we made that call I think pretty much just on gut and it was like, this is a business decision. This is where we think the next phase needs to be.

Maya Prohovnik (00:23:25):
When we built Anchor 2.0, it was a lot more like the tools that we wanted to use, even though it wasn't what the user base was asking for. So I think that's one example of sometimes it's that whole users don't always know what to ask for, they don't always know what problems they need you to solve for them. And so I think you really have to be able to hear what's behind it or really even if the data is looking okay, think about if it's heading to where you need it to go.

Lenny (00:23:51):
Before you move on, that's actually such an interesting story because it's so hard to have a product that's working that people love and decide to change it completely. Many founders are probably stuck in this where they're just like, hey, this is working and we're feeling some fit. Is there anything else you learned from that? Because that's a really interesting insight and it worked out in your case clearly.

Maya Prohovnik (00:24:15):
It absolutely worked out. I mean, I think it was a terrifying transition. Us at the time, it took us a few months to build a whole new app, it takes longer now, but the whole time we were building it, we were like, we weren't sure if it was a mistake and we would go back and forth and we would feel guilty when we were talking to our users about what they wanted us to be working on. But I think it was one of those things where as soon as we launched 2.0, our numbers started shooting up and we started seeing more kinds of people were using it and people were suddenly using it in the way that we had always imagined as a replacement for the old school, very difficult to make traditional podcasts.

Maya Prohovnik (00:24:50):
I don't know. I guess the lesson is you have to be able to tell the signal through the noise, and even if you've got lots of vocal users asking for something, we used to have this rule, the 80/20 rule, where it's like you can't just build for that 20, I don't think we made this up by the way. I think this is a common thing, but we'd always refer to it and say, we want to be building for the 80%, and even though the 20% are going to be more vocal, that's just going to get you deeper into that hole of that problem of you're not really building for everyone. And I think particularly when you're trying to build a creative platform, you're trying to democratize something and your target user is everyone on the planet. I think you really have to be willing to kill your darlings and let things go when they're not getting where you need them to be.

Lenny (00:25:35):
That's probably the most common cases. Something is working, but it's not working incredibly well. What do we do? And so that's really interesting. I feel like the first thing you said there is really important of just we had a much bigger mission and vision, and even though this is working, this is never going to get there. There's no path to building a massive business.

Maya Prohovnik (00:25:52):
I do think that's so important, and I give a lot of credit to Mike and our co-founders. I think they really knew what they wanted to do when they started the company and they were very firm on that and never varied that throughout the years throughout the acquisition. And so I do think not everyone's goal is to build a massive multi-billion dollar world changing business, that's okay if that's not your goal, but if that is your goal, you have to stick to it and it's really hard, but you have to keep pivoting to get to where you want to be.

Lenny (00:26:21):
Kill your darlings. I love that phrase, I use it all the time. I think you had a second example. I have a couple other questions of Anchor, but did you want to share another example?

Maya Prohovnik (00:26:28):
Sure, I can just quickly, my second example was, so we actually had to do it again. So we went from Anchor 1.0 to 2.0, we were like, that was totally the right call. And then Anchor 2.0, we were still in this phase where we would always joke about it because people would be like, "Oh, it's kind of like making a podcast." And we would be like, it's not a podcast because we're trying to be bigger than podcasts. Because we were at the time, 2015, there were still so few people podcasting, it was still so hard to do. And so we originally were really stuck on this idea that podcasting was going to be limiting and that we wanted to be the next thing. In the early days of Anchor, we had all this nautical terminology, so we would call them waves and I don't remember what else, but we had cute nautical terms for everything we were trying to resist podcast and podcaster and those things.

Maya Prohovnik (00:27:11):
And when we launched Anchor 2.0, we started getting all of this really great traction and the number one feature requests that we got from people is they were like, great, I love using these tools and then I want to export it as a podcast and publish it and get people listening that way. And we resisted it for probably, I don't know, six months or something and we were like, absolutely not, that's not what we're doing. And I think that one was such an interesting lesson because we had just learned that we did the right thing by not listening to our users. So for a while we dug in and we were like, that's not the direction we're going in, they don't know what they actually want. And then when we decided, I think we started with like, oh, we'll do a little test and let people export us podcasts and see what happens.

Maya Prohovnik (00:27:48):
And when we look back at our data, that's the moment when we saw the beginning of that hockey stick growth where it's like we had been growing, we had been doing well, and then you zoom out and you're like, okay, that was very clearly the thing we were missing. Yet again, we had to stop what we were doing, we rebuilt the entire app, we built it around RSS and podcasting and being able to export. And we actually did some really cool things to make it really easy for people to publish their podcast everywhere. So I think that was really the moment that it took off. And I think it's so interesting putting those two things together because it was the opposite thing the second time that we had to give up on a piece of what we had thought was so inherently true about our business.

Maya Prohovnik (00:28:28):
And so I don't know what lesson to tell people to take away from that other than I think you have to just stay, especially in a startup mentality, you have to stay willing to be flexible and take in new information and new data points as your product matures and as your user base changes, there's going to be new things that you learn that are going to change how you think about it. And I think again, the one thing that was unwavering for us was our mission and everything else was mutable for us where we were like, whatever we need to do to get there will work. And I do think looking back, it's astonishing how brave we were that we kept finding some product market fit and being like, nope, that's not enough. And then moving to the next thing. And I think that obviously worked out really well for us and meant that we were able to do what we set out to do and really democratize the medium and make things a lot easier for a lot more people.

Lenny (00:29:15):
I think another lesson there is just try stuff. Like you said, you tried this export thing, let's just see what happens. No, we don't think this is where we need to go, but let's just try it and maybe it'll work. And clearly that became the core of the product and platform.

Maya Prohovnik (00:29:27):
Totally. And also, you never know which of those tiny product changes are going to end up being this existential moment for your business. You really have to keep your eyes open and be ready for that to happen anytime, especially when you're still trying to figure out where your place is going to be.

Lenny (00:29:42):
You mentioned there was this feature that made it easy to distribute your podcast, and this touches on a question that actually asked Mike Mignano, the CEO of anchor what to ask you. And he's like, ask her about the story of how you made that actually possible to distribute the podcast to platforms, and it ended up being a very unscalable solution.

Maya Prohovnik (00:30:00):
One of our principles from the very early days of Anchor was build things that don't scale, where we were like, we're a ridiculously tiny team. We're trying to do this really big thing. We had raised very little money, and so we were always just trying to figure out how can we hack into whatever growth we're trying to make happen. So when it turned out that people wanted to distribute their podcasts everywhere, it's gotten a little bit easier. But at the time, I'm sure you remember what podcast distribution was like, where it's like there's all of these different podcast platforms you have to manually distribute to all of them. Apple Podcasts in particular can be really difficult for people who aren't tech-savvy because there's this whole, you have to prove that you own your RSS feed, you have to know what an RSS feed is.

Maya Prohovnik (00:30:44):
You have to sometimes deal with 301 redirects. There's just all this stuff that's deeply technical in a way that we were just like it doesn't need to be. And so one of the steps there was to submit your podcast to Apple Podcasts, you had to have an Apple ID, and there are a lot of people in the world who don't have iPhones, and so we're building for everybody. So we were like, how can we reduce that friction? We were obsessed with reducing friction, this was our constant battle. And so we had this idea, we hired a couple of college interns and we brought them in and we were like, people are going to push this magical one button in the Anchor app and they're going to say, I want to distribute my podcast, and your job is going to be to do all that same manual stuff manually, but to them it's going to feel magical and it happened automatically. I still don't know how many people know this.

Maya Prohovnik (00:31:27):
I think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts. And that resulted in lots of interesting technical and relationship situations. It was a really interesting thing, and eventually that didn't scale, eventually we stopped doing that, obviously, but I think that is such a cool example of the importance of how you're packaging what you're offering to people where if we had said you request distribution and we'll have one of our team members get back to you in three days and let you know when you're on Apple Podcasts, that doesn't feel very magical or it's really saving you any time. If all you see as a user is you're hitting a button and then 24 hours later you're somehow magically on Apple Podcasts, that was so much easier than manual distribution was at the time.

Maya Prohovnik (00:32:20):
And I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point. So, it's funny now to think back on that, but I think it's also related to we were so good at being willing to humor what seemed like stupid ideas and try them. And so that is something that I definitely recommend to product people is let yourself have the silly ideas we always talked about yes and when someone has an idea, how can you build on it and think about how it might work instead of saying, no, that can't work because, and so we had a number of those things where it was like nobody understood how we were doing things so differently, and it was just because we weren't afraid to do the silly unscalable thing for a while.

Lenny (00:33:08):
I love that story. Touches on two things, one is I was just doing an interview around how to drive word to mouth growth and make that a big driver of your growth. And the main message there is just make something remarkable and knock people's socks off that they're just like, oh wow, this is crazy, I'm going to share it with my friend. And that's such a good example of that where everyone's like, wow, that was easy, I'm going to tell all my other friends that are launching podcasts. The other is, I wonder just how much of tech is built off of college interns, the beginnings of companies or how important college interns are to technology and innovation. It feels like there's always an intern story.

Maya Prohovnik (00:33:42):
Yeah, I know. I think they must be. And for the record, we paid them very well, these were not unpaid interns, just to be clear. But no, I think it is amazing, and I think it was also such a cool opportunity. One of those interns actually is still a PM on my team today. She ended up converting a full-time after she graduated. And I remember I had a lot of cool college internships and it's such a cool way to get exposure to industries that you otherwise wouldn't get to. So I would definitely recommend that college kids start with, it's okay if your first job is like a repetitive, not very exciting thing. If you do a good job, it will lead to something very exciting maybe.

Lenny (00:34:15):
I love that. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team for Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn and Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated two to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.

Lenny (00:35:14):
Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. So we've been talking about Anchor and I think what's really interesting about Anchor is it's one of the very rare success stories of an acquisition working out incredibly well. It was a small startup now powering two thirds of all new podcasts. It's pretty insane. So I want to spend a little time on just what worked in making that possible. So let me ask first around the integration piece, just how you integrated successfully, and then I want to talk about just operationalizing and making it continue running successfully.

Maya Prohovnik (00:36:03):
Totally.

Lenny (00:36:04):
Yeah. So on the first piece, just what did you do right to integrate Anchor into Spotify to make it effective and continue working?

Maya Prohovnik (00:36:10):
I think it's a combination of luck and hard work because Spotify is genuinely an amazing company. I mean, you've met now a bunch of people who I work with at Spotify, including my boss, Gustav. It's an incredible company. They're Swedish. So just their mindset about everything in the first place is amazing. But also, I have been so impressed that they are the type of company that can still move quickly and make really big strategic decisions and strategic shifts. It never feels like they're slowing down. And so I think our way of working worked with them. And then I think the other thing that we had to our benefit was they really saw the same vision that we had. So it was like they also wanted to change podcasting and make it more democratized and make it more two-way and bring it into the future.

Maya Prohovnik (00:36:53):
And it was so interesting because when we started talking to them, both of us had this chicken or egg marketplace problem where we had this critical mass of creators. They had a critical mass at that point of consumers, but if you don't have both on the same place, then you're still stuck with the limitations of RSS feeds. And so I think we were both coming at the acquisition with the same frustration just from two different angles. And so both of us really saw that benefit in joining up. And so I think one of the big ways we were lucky is that what I've seen happen in a lot of acquisitions is you have an idea of what you're getting acquired for and you get excited and really attached to that vision, and then when that vision doesn't end up fitting into the company strategy, there's nowhere else to go.

Maya Prohovnik (00:37:34):
And I think in a lot of ways Anchor did really well fit into Spotify's culture and their roadmap, but there were many things that changed around that initial vision. And I think we were really good at making sure that we stayed valuable to Spotify. That was one of our goals when we got acquired where we were like, we're tiny startup people, and we're like, we're not going to get lost in this big sea. When we came in, it was like we were very vocal about everything that we were doing, we did lots of internal marketing and made sure people were excited. We built a lot of really strong relationships. We made sure that every team at Spotify knew about us and what we were doing. We were constantly asking how we could help other teams. And when the strategy shifted, which it has dozens of times since we've gotten acquired almost five years ago, not like we just blindly followed, but we were always willing to get excited about whatever the next thing was and willing to be helpful and figure out how to make that work.

Maya Prohovnik (00:38:30):
And I think it actually goes back to the sticking to the mission in the first place where Spotify and we want podcasting to be able to be a huge business for the industry. We think it's been held back by a lot of things for a long time. And so we've had various hypotheses about how we can get there and we try things and if something doesn't work, we go onto the next thing. But that goal hasn't really changed.

Lenny (00:38:55):
That makes a lot of sense. And I love the idea of just staying excited about what is happening. I think a lot of founders join and they're like, "Oh, it's so annoying to work in this big company." "Oh man, we have this original plan, it's just not happening." And I think even if you're probably not, even if you're not excited, I think it's effective to communicate that you're excited and be on board and then shift things in what direction you think maybe needs to go instead.

Maya Prohovnik (00:39:19):
Totally, yeah.

Lenny (00:39:20):
Okay. And then in terms of operating within Spotify, from what I understand, your team is still very startupy and there's this really fast moving mentality. What have you learned and how do you do that? How do you make that happen within a larger company?

Maya Prohovnik (00:39:34):
We've definitely slowed down a little, I will say. I'm always joking about when we first got acquired, I remember we had to do this spreadsheet outlining our roadmap and estimate are things like small, extra large, whatever, and Spotify's definition of small with something like a quarter. And I was like, we've never built anything that took more than three months. And now it's like now we build lots of things to take more than three months. But the first thing that comes to mind, so when we were a startup, one of the first things we did when we were only a few people, we decided what our core values were going to be. And I think they maybe very trivially have changed over the years, but we essentially still have the same four core values that we decided on seven or eight years ago now. And when we got acquired, we had a conversation with our team where we said, we're going to of course embrace Spotify's culture and Spotify's core values, but we're not going to forget who we are as a team.

Maya Prohovnik (00:40:28):
And I think part of what really... And one of our core values by the way, is move fast. So that's something that's very deep within our DNA. But I think one of the things that helped with that is Daniel Eck, when we got acquired, came and talked to our team, which was so cool and so motivational. And one of the things he said to us was, we had a reputation at the time for moving very quickly, even compared to other startups. We were shipping a new feature every two weeks, it was insane. And Daniel said to us, not only do I want you to not move slower, that's part of why we're acquiring you so that you can move quickly. But he said, I also want you to help me teach the rest of Spotify how to move more quickly, and I found that so motivating.

Maya Prohovnik (00:41:04):
Because I think I definitely had that feeling going from startup to larger organization where I had this fear that it was just going to be bureaucracy and things moving so slowly. And I really loved that. That was one of his goals was that he was like, I want to make sure Spotify also grew really quickly and he was trying to figure out how to help them keep moving as quickly as they used to. And so I think that's something that I really took to heart and that I've continued to remind my team of even to this day where I think of that as part of my job here to help people think about how we can move quickly and what really matters. And I think at any large organization, there's obviously a lot more complexities, there's a lot more stakeholders.

Maya Prohovnik (00:41:42):
So to some extent it's necessary to slow down and be thoughtful. But I think the things that I always try to push people on is the unnecessary things that slow you down. So I think that's what we spend a lot of time on, both within our team and when we're collaborating with other teams at Spotify because we work with basically everyone at this point. So I think that was really cool that he gave us that mission when we joined.

Lenny (00:42:03):
On that note, is there anything that has been a real challenge or become really annoying? Just real talk about the flip side of that. Everyone's always like, "Oh, it's all working out great." Is there anything you could share that's just like, "Oh wow, that was really hard and we overcame it, or a real challenge that we didn't expect?"

Maya Prohovnik (00:42:19):
I think that the downside of Daniel's advice, so one of the things he said to us, he was literally say no to all the meetings. You're going to get invited to all these off sites and meetings and everyone's going to want to meet you guys and they're going to want you to come to all of these events and whatever. And he was like, just keep being Anchor. Just keep doing what you're doing for at least the next year. Don't worry about what Spotify's doing. And on the one hand, of course, we loved that as startup people we're like, cool, we're going to get to stay us within this larger organization. But the downside that we didn't really realize until a year later was that we weren't really able to build relationships. We had some culture problems where our team started to feel like because they weren't part of Spotify, they had some existential, they didn't feel attached to the work that we were doing.

Maya Prohovnik (00:43:03):
And so for a year we operated on our own. We moved really quickly, we were able to get a lot done, but then I think our next phase had to be really deeply incorporating into Spotify. And so we stopped calling our team Anchor internally, we started collaborating more with other teams. And I think that is the necessary trade-off is the more deeply you're embedded, the slower things are going to go. But I think that has been really amazing for making sure that our team actually felt like a part of the larger mission that Spotify was doing. And the one other thing I'll say that I found pretty striking. So, Spotify, as you know, did a lot of podcast acquisitions soon after the Anchor one. And so I got to know a lot of the other founders and early employees who have been acquired by Spotify and something that I've found with them and just with other acquired founders who I've talked to since, I don't know, I feel like people don't talk about this enough publicly.

Maya Prohovnik (00:43:59):
Maybe people are somewhere and I just haven't seen it. I think that people who get acquired, especially founders, actually go through a relatively deep depression and existential crisis after getting acquired. And I never would've thought, when you're talking to people about getting acquired, it sounds like such an obvious positive. Like you said, it's like this amazing positive exit and it was objectively so good for our team and for us and for our users, and I think for the industry. And I personally did not expect to go through that. Because I was like of course you want an exit, that's what you're working towards that whole time that you're a startup. And I've talked to a lot of these founders and I think it is a process I think that everyone has to go through because either you decide I'm going to stay here and I'm going to do this for a long time and I can make this work for me.

Maya Prohovnik (00:44:44):
Or you're like, I'm just a startup founder and this doesn't really work for me and I'm going to go do my next thing. And so I think to some extent some of the things we were talking about, I think do help shake out whether people actually want to make those investments and figure out how to make things work at a big company. But I think the other thing that I've found is just I think there isn't enough support for that transition. And I think that for me, I've definitely landed on the side of, I love working at Spotify. I now am so excited to be part of a large organization and building things at this scale, but I really would've loved to been able to talk to someone about it or understand that there were other people going through that kind of thing.

Maya Prohovnik (00:45:25):
So I don't know if you want an example of how it's not all rainbows and sunshine, I definitely think there were some dark times there and I've since learned everyone goes through that just because I think just by definition, all the reasons that you start a company, that means your personality is someone who wants to be having that direct impact and having your own ownership and being able to make things move quickly, and that is just so different once you join a large organization.

Lenny (00:45:54):
Yeah, and those are amazing examples. I think what's interesting with startup life is eventually if things work out well, you'll either end up working for a larger company, that's a likely scenario if things tip go great or you're running a public company, which is also extremely painful and stressful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:46:11):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:46:12):
Yeah. So, the paths are hard no matter what you end up doing, as much as you love that startup time. I actually went through the same thing when we sold our company to Airbnb. I was just like, man, I had this life goal of starting a company and now I've done it and now what do I do? And it was just like, huh, okay, I guess I got to figure it out.

Maya Prohovnik (00:46:29):
Right? It's like, who am I? And I think the thing that I think for me, and it sounds similar to you, I think I didn't realize how much value I put in the actual day-to-day of survival that comes with being part of a startup. That becomes almost your reason for being is like, I got to make this work and I got to keep the team motivated. And you're just going, going, going, and then when everything is suddenly stable, you're like, wait, what is my job now?

Lenny (00:46:57):
I saw a tweet actually recently, I forget who tweeted this, that CEOs that exit and go on vacation end up being more stressed and less healthy than running a really high stress, high growth company.

Maya Prohovnik (00:47:08):
That is wild. I get it though.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Yeah. Although I will say when I joined Airbnb and was just the PM of our team working on one thing, it was like, this is really cool. I don't have to worry about everything all the time, there's a really nice relief to that. But yeah, there's a life existential question of just like, wow, we did the thing. What am I? What else? There's usually not a goal beyond that.

Maya Prohovnik (00:47:31):
Totally.

Lenny (00:47:32):
What was it for you? Was it that, was it the feeling of I had this thing that I was running and now I don't?

Maya Prohovnik (00:47:37):
I think it was a little bit the fear of being like a cog in a wheel, which is not actually how I feel now that I work at Spotify. And I think the other was like we were doing great, we already were killing it at podcast hosting. And also it was just so fun. I really valued that small company, everyone knows each other. We're doing really hard work, but we're also having so much fun. And I think it felt like I couldn't translate that to a large organization where I was like, okay, now I have to do things how they do. And then I think what actually ended up happening is I actually love how Spotify runs their company and I'm still able to run my team the way that works for me. And so I think it just goes back to knowing what you care about, being really solidly attached to your own core values and being able to take that with you.

Lenny (00:48:25):
I think we're both examples of people that were startup people and then realized it's not so bad working at a big company. I stayed at Airbnb for seven years. I was like, no, no way, I'm going to be here for more than a year and a half or a year or two. How long have you been at Spotify? At this point?

Maya Prohovnik (00:48:37):
I'm going on five years. Yeah.

Lenny (00:48:41):
No, I think this is just a example of it's you think you're not going to enjoy working at a larger company, but oftentimes it's actually pretty great for a lot of different reasons.

Maya Prohovnik (00:48:48):
Yes.

Lenny (00:48:49):
Shifting in a slightly different direction, just thinking about leadership and what you've learned to lead teams, lead large orgs, build products, is there any just, I don't know, frameworks or tools that you found to be effective?

Maya Prohovnik (00:49:05):
The big one for me is Radical Candor. And I know my team watching this is going to laugh at me because I talk about this every day. They're tired of hearing it, but have you read it?

Lenny (00:49:15):
I have. I love it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:49:17):
Yeah. It's my all time favorite book. And I think it really shifted for me, honestly how I relate to people in general. But I think especially with managing, giving feedback, being able to collaborate and push back in a direct way, direct and constructive way on peers and that sort of thing. So I make all of my managers on my team read it. We talk about it constantly in our team, and I think that the general concepts for anyone who's not familiar is you need to care personally and challenge directly. And if you're only doing one of those things, you're not giving feedback in an effective way. And the book just talks so much about the importance of feedback and how feedback is a gift, which I have now come to completely agree with. It's like anytime I've given someone effective feedback, it's always well received, even if it's tough to hear, people want to get better and they want to know how they can improve.

Maya Prohovnik (00:50:07):
And so I think anytime that you can give them specific feedback in a way that makes it clear that you care about them and want them to be able to reach their goals, I think it makes them stronger, it makes your relationship stronger. And I also think the one other big thing I took away from Radical Candor was when it comes to people not underperforming, it really reframed how I think about that because people are not generally inherently bad or lazy or ineffective, it's almost always because the role they're in is the wrong fit. And so being able to approach the conversation in that way means that you can come at it and in a caring way that lets them know you actually want them to be successful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:50:47):
And what I found is when you have the conversation in that way, they're much more receptive to it. And then you're able to either actually resolve the issues or you're able to help them figure out what the right fit is for them, which I think as a manager, it's so inspiring to me because that means that you get to keep mentoring them beyond. You're not just saying, this isn't working, I'm giving up on you, see you later. You're saying, I'm committed to helping you throughout your whole career and let's help you find the next step, even if that isn't on my team or at this company.

Lenny (00:51:16):
Awesome. Yeah, I love that book. And you talked about the two. There's this grid that-

Maya Prohovnik (00:51:21):
The quadrants?

Lenny (00:51:22):
Yeah, it talks about. And just to reinforce what you just said, the core is that when you want to give people direct feedback, but you want to make it clear you care deeply about them. And I love that she talks about if you do one of these wrong, here's what happens. If you challenge directly, but it doesn't feel like you care deeply, you're just an asshole and they're just like, yeah, God, you get really defensive. I should get her on this podcast. How cool would that be?

Maya Prohovnik (00:51:43):
Oh my God, that would be my, she's my... If I could meet one tech celebrity, it would be her.

Lenny (00:51:48):
Okay. I'm going to work on it. If you're listening and you're Kim Scott, let me know, I will try to get to her. Anything else in that bucket of frameworks or tools, things that you find really helpful leadership?

Maya Prohovnik (00:51:58):
The only other one, I'm not a huge framework person. I think this goes back to my gut thing, but the one other thing that I refer to often is I love the Eisenhower Matrix, which is also known as the four Ds. So it's do, defer, delegate, delete, you have also quadrants. Maybe my brain just works in quadrants. I don't know. But I totally subscribe to that and that's how I do everything, where I write everything down at the end of every day, I go through and I either do delegate, defer, delete, and it really helps you clear a lot of stuff out of your brain.

Lenny (00:52:27):
Interesting. So you don't even use it as a grid necessarily, it's more make a decision on all the things on your plate?

Maya Prohovnik (00:52:34):
Yeah, I do. I just tried using the grid view and it didn't work for me for some reason. So I just use a to-do list, and then I don't let myself finish working until I've gone through anything I didn't get through that day, and then I know what I have to do the next day.

Lenny (00:52:46):
So that touches on another area I wanted to touch on, which is productivity. I hear you're very good at being productive and making the use of your time. I guess one, where do you think that comes from? And then two, just any other tips, tactics, tools you find to be really effective in staying productive?

Maya Prohovnik (00:53:01):
Yeah, where does that come from? I think I am OCD. I think I'm an overachiever. I don't know, it's really important to me. I think when my team says that I'm very productive, the feedback I hear from them is they're impressed that they send me a doc and then I always read it. I think that's more about prioritizing my team and making sure that they're unblocked, which I take very seriously. I don't know other tips that I would give people. I write everything down because I think I'm one of those people I remember things best when they're written down and then I obsessively put things on my to-do list. Anything that anyone asks me to do goes on there, and then I have that method for organizing it later in the day.

Lenny (00:53:38):
Do you have an app for this or do you write it on paper?

Maya Prohovnik (00:53:40):
I use Todoist. I think you can use any, but it's the one that works best for me. I love using paper, but then if I don't have it with me, then I can't remember anything I have to do, so I've had to go digital.

Lenny (00:53:51):
Awesome. So it sounds like a big part of your process is just getting things out of your head and writing it down somewhere.

Maya Prohovnik (00:53:56):
Yes. I think that's huge. And I also think if you're in any sort of job, I think most PMs have this where it's so much of your job is actually deep thinking and problem solving. I just cannot get that done if I'm running through my to-do list in my head. So I think that was a big unlock for me when I realized that I just needed to, anytime I'm stressed, honestly, if I just sit and make a list of all the things I have to do, I'm like, oh, it's four things, I can get those done, it's okay.

Lenny (00:54:18):
Man, that tool of just making a list when you're stressed about, all the things you got to do, just making a list of it on paper, I find it so helpful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:54:27):
It works every time.

Lenny (00:54:28):
Have you read Getting Things Done by David Allen?

Maya Prohovnik (00:54:31):
It's on my list. I haven't read it.

Lenny (00:54:32):
Okay. That book totally transformed how I think about productivity, and you already doing a lot of what he recommends. It's like this very old book. And now he's just, I don't know, he's a public speaker dude that just goes around consulting. But this one, it has very simple approaches to being productive and it really changed the way I operate. And you're already doing a lot of it, so I don't know how much value you get out of it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:54:53):
I'll read it. I love this stuff.

Lenny (00:54:55):
A core concept is this idea of mind like water where you don't want to have anything in your head, you want to get it all out. And then there's these systems for how to process all the things you're getting out.

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:04):
Totally.

Lenny (00:55:05):
Maybe we'll get David Allen this. We got a whole list.

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:07):
I know we have a whole hit list.

Lenny (00:55:10):
Maybe it's just a final question. You're good at so many things, another thing you're really good at is public speaking. I was watching the last Spotify launch event and I was just like, holy moly, she's incredibly good at speaking and it's something I want to get better at and something I think a 100% of people want to get better at. So, I'm just curious, what have you learned about being an effective public speaker? Anything that you could recommend to people if they're trying to get better at this?

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:32):
Well, first of all, thank you for saying I'm awesome at so many things. This is my favorite podcast I've ever been on, you're just complimenting me the whole time, so I'll take it.

Lenny (00:55:39):
True.

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:41):
I think with public speaking, for me, the first thing that I had to do was decide that I didn't hate public speaking because I think it's human nature. It makes sense that we do not want to be in front of a crowd and we don't want to be performing. And it's just an unnatural thing that humans, I think make ourselves do. I remember actually when I was in high school, I had to give a presentation and I had so much anxiety I couldn't sleep the night before. And I remember I was getting ready for school that morning and I was like, I'm just not going to hate public speaking. I just can't get through my life feeling this way. And so I just got up there and I had fun with it, and it felt so much better to not feel worried about it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:56:18):
So I think ever since then I've been okay at it. And then I have gotten lots of opportunities to do big scary public speaking things for Spotify, and so I think I've had to get even better. I think my tips would be my biggest one is probably reframing. Everyone has this anxiety before they have to perform or they go on stage. Reframing that anxiety to understand that the thing your body is doing is surging you with adrenaline to help you. And so letting that feeling wash over you instead of fighting it, I think has been so effective for me because otherwise, it can feel like a panic attack. And so I think you have to be like, cool, my body's getting ready. We're excited, we're going to go do this on stage. That has been really helpful. I practice a million times anytime I have to do public speaking.

Maya Prohovnik (00:57:03):
So I think everybody has different memorization tactics, different ways of doing speaker notes that work for them. And so I think part of it is you have to do a bunch of public speaking to see what works for you. So some people work best with no notes. I almost read complete sentences a good, I can enunciate things while I'm reading, so that works best for me. Some people like bullets and then they go a little bit off the script. But I think once you figure out what method of speaker notes works for you, I rehearse probably at least 10 times all the way through once the speaker notes are final. And you can practice your exact delivery. You can practice where you're going to put jokes in. You can figure out what doesn't feel natural or where you're going to trip it up, and then you can change the words that you're using.

Maya Prohovnik (00:57:42):
And so I like to get to the point where I can remember ad-lib at least half of the notes that I have in there, and that way I know I'm going to feel confident coming off script. I make a lot of eye contact with the audience, which I think makes them think that I'm not reading speaker notes. So I think that's really important. If you can stand it, which I can't, record yourself or watch yourself in a mirror, it messes me up more. But I think for a lot of people, that can be really helpful to figure out where your issues are. I think the biggest thing for me honestly, is that the unfair advantage I have is if you really give a shit about what you're talking about, you are going to be such a better presenter because people are going to be able to tell that you care.

Maya Prohovnik (00:58:20):
And so I think even at a larger Spotify event where it's like I'm reading off a teleprompter and I'm reading, I'm marketing, but I'm helping write those words and then the way that I'm saying them matters because I'm talking to podcasters and I'm like, my mission in life is to make things better for you, not everyone gets that benefit, I guess. Sometimes you have to do public speaking about things that you're not very passionate about, but I certainly think that helps. And I think leaning into that, so when you can, telling personal stories, letting the audience get to know you, I like to work some humor into my presentations. I think that can really help as well.

Lenny (00:58:55):
That is awesome advice. I especially love letting the stress wash over you, because most of has this challenge. Your body's just doing all this shit that's just going to stress the shit out of you. And so the idea of just embracing it, just flowing with it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:10):
Yes, it's a superpower. It's like, that's so cool, that adrenaline works that way.

Lenny (00:59:14):
Yeah. Okay. I'm going to try that one.

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:16):
Also, if you're nervous, you can put your hands above your head that'll help the blood, I don't know, it helps it go into your head or something. I don't remember.

Lenny (00:59:23):
There's this whole power post thing that apparently has-

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:26):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:59:26):
I think it's been disproven. People are like, no, there's no data that shows that. But the blood thing that's really interesting versus psychological benefits.

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:34):
I think there is a real physiological thing that happens.

Lenny (00:59:36):
That's cool. Okay. Amazing. Okay. Maybe as an actual last question, what's happening in the future of the Spotify podcasting platform? Anything you want to share about where things are going?

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:45):
A lot of the things that I talked about at Stream on for anyone who saw that this year, I think are still very much our strategy. So I think for us in general, Spotify is really focused on making sure that we can... We have a massive audience, we have more than 500 million monthly active listeners. We want to help podcast creators reach that global audience, and so it's really important to us. I always tell my team the biggest problem that I want to solve for podcasters is discovery and audience growth, and I really think we can be the ones to do it, so I'm really excited about that. So discovery, monetization. We're really focused on making sure that creators of all shapes and sizes can make a living off of their work.

Maya Prohovnik (01:00:24):
And then I think in general, we're working on so many cool things at Spotify to make podcasts a more interactive format, something that allows you to get to know your audience and connect with your fan base. We talked about a couple features this past year. I definitely can't say anything specific, but what I can say is there is lots of really cool stuff coming next year that I'm very excited about. And I would say for anyone who wants to learn more, definitely sign up for Spotify for podcasters. It works whether you're hosted with Spotify or not, and you can start to get a sense of some of those features that we're opening up to everybody, but there's lots more cool stuff to come.

Lenny (01:00:58):
Amazing, mysterious, and exciting. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Maya Prohovnik (01:01:05):
Yes.

Lenny (01:01:06):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Maya Prohovnik (01:01:09):
Children of Time, and I guess I would say It by Stephen King. I recommend a lot of Stephen King books, but that's my all time favorite.

Lenny (01:01:16):
Very on brand with your podcasts. Makes sense. What is a recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Maya Prohovnik (01:01:23):
TV show, I'll just say, I guess Pokerface was the last one that really blew my mind. Movies, I mean, Barbie was so good, and then I'll just give you a lesser known one. I just watched this crazy movie from the '80s that was made the same year Home Alone was, this just got featured on a podcast, so I think everybody's talking about it now, but it's a horror movie about a kid who's home alone, and then he has to fight Santa Claus in a home invasion situation. It is so good, it has a bunch of different names, but if you look up either Game Over or it's like Code Père Noël or something, it's an old French horror movie, so good.

Lenny (01:01:59):
Interesting that the other Home Alone is the one that did well in this one.

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:02):
Well, there was apparently a whole legal thing over it.

Lenny (01:02:05):
Oh, wow. They didn't have Macaulay Culkin. That's their missing piece. What is a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates when you're interviewing?

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:14):
I have one. It is, if you could make a podcast about anything, what would it be? And it is the best. Honestly, you should ask people that even if you don't work in work in podcasting, because it tells you so much about candidates, and one thing that I feel very strongly is that the most important thing is that you're hiring passionate people, not people who are passionate necessarily about the thing that you're doing, but about anything. If they can't think of anything, that's a red flag for me.

Lenny (01:02:33):
That's awesome. It's like a variation of the question of Teach me something or tell me about something that you've learned recently. Really interesting tweak on that question and very appropriate. What is a favorite product or something awesome you've discovered recently that you really like digital or physical?

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:49):
Okay. Very unsexy answer, but I love 1-800-CONTACTS.

Lenny (01:02:53):
Okay.

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:54):
I'm so impressed with their product team. If you need new contacts, even if you need a new prescription, you can do the whole thing online in five minutes, and it's so well-thought-out and so thoughtful. I love them. And then the one other one I'll give a shout-out to, since becoming a parent, Love Every, do you subscribe to them?

Lenny (01:03:09):
Absolutely. I don't know anyone that doesn't have them.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:12):
I know. It's so good.

Lenny (01:03:12):
They've cracked it.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:14):
Yes.

Lenny (01:03:15):
Yeah. We are missing some of the toys, and so we're trying to find where they went because he's ready for the rattle.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:25):
Yes. Awesome.

Lenny (01:03:25):
Yeah. I love everybody's amazing and their ads are really great. Oh, man.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:27):
Yes. They're so good.

Lenny (01:03:29):
What is a favorite life motto that you come back to often share with folks? Anything there?

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:36):
"Only a fool wishes time away." Even if you're having a bad day, even if you're doing something boring or you're stressed, you have to do public speaking, that's still your life and you should enjoy it.

Lenny (01:03:47):
I love that. There's this phrase of just like, I'm just killing time right now, and I always think about that, just like, oh, but you don't have that much time. Maybe you shouldn't try to kill yourself.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:58):
Even though sometimes things are boring, it reminds me of another quote of just, "Most of the world's problems are caused by our inability to sit in a room for 10 minutes quietly."

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:07):
Yes. Also, if you're bored, have a baby because you'll never be bored again.

Lenny (01:04:11):
Yeah. Yep, indeed. Speaking of parenting, what is a valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught you?

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:18):
My mom always told me that my generosity would be rewarded, so anytime that I was nice or thought of someone else before me, she always made sure that I got some little reward or got to go out for ice cream or something, I think that really worked on me.

Lenny (01:04:34):
I love that. Final question, I saw somewhere that you raised bait backyard chickens. Is that true?

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:40):
I'm so happy you asked about my chickens'.

Lenny (01:04:43):
I love that reaction. So maybe just why did you decide to do that and any tips for someone that may want to explore it?

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:48):
Oh my God. Well, we should have started with this because I can talk about this for an hour and a half, but I love my chickens. I have eight of them, we've got one rooster and seven hens. I think that all of us should be a little bit closer to nature, to the, I was going to say, the food that we're eating, I'm not going to eat my chickens, but they make eggs for me. But I just think there is something very lacking in our modern lives, that connection to nature. When I feel stressed at work and I go outside and I hang out with my chickens, I pet them, and I give them treats and we talk to each other. It's like nothing makes me happier and feel more grounded than hanging out with my chickens. So I think everyone should have chickens. I would say they're pretty low maintenance, so if you're thinking about it, I would recommend it. And if you get chickens, my favorite thing that I did for them, I got this monthly subscription box for chickens I think it's called Coop Crate.

Lenny (01:05:40):
Love Every for Chickens.

Maya Prohovnik (01:05:41):
Yes, it's Love Every for Chickens and every month they send me chicken treats, but also fun little things for crazy chicken people, so it's clothes or a sticker, something funny.I'm very into the whole chicken thing, so, yeah.

Lenny (01:05:55):
Oh my God. Maybe just a tactical question, how much space do you need in your yard for chickens?

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:00):
Not that much, so we let them free-range. We have a pretty big yard, but I think their actual, so there's their little coop, and then they've got a run that's fenced in. The run is maybe like, I don't know, five feet by eight feet or something, but you can go a lot smaller. If you go to Home Depot, they actually sell pre-made coops and runs. I think if you have a decent sized backyard, they'll be fine. I've known people with pretty small yards, and you just let your chickens out and they're happy and they'll find worms in a few yards.

Lenny (01:06:27):
Oh man. All right. A new project to look into.

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:29):
Please get chickens, do it.

Lenny (01:06:31):
Okay. Maya, we've talked about chickens, dogfooding, gut level decisions, Radical Candor, so many things. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:43):
I'm on threads, I guess, and I'm on LinkedIn. I'm Maya Fish on most social media, and then I'm on LinkedIn, and then, what was the second one? How can people be useful to me?

Lenny (01:06:53):
Exactly.

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:55):
Listen to your podcast on Spotify, and then send me your feedback. I would love to know either as a podcast creator or as a podcast listener. Always happy to hear what Spotify can be doing more of or better to help you out.

Lenny (01:07:06):
Amazing. Maya, thank you so much for being here.

# Lessons from Atlassian | Megan Cook (Head of Product, Jira)

## Transcript

Megan Cook (00:00:00):
What we put into place is something we call Fight Club. I'll probably get in trouble for talking about Fight Club. The first rule is you don't talk about Fight Club. But it's 30 minutes every week, and it's just for myself, my engineering, and my design leader; and we get together, and we know that we're going there to have a conflict.

(00:00:18):
I think often when there's difficult conversations, or those conflicts come up, you can put them off until they become much bigger. Or if somebody is conflict adverse, they can try to avoid having it at all. But by having a specific slot of time in your week for something like that, then you're sort of in that mindset. You know you're going in there to solve a hard problem. You know that there's going to be a disagreement. And it makes it much better. I think the relationship we all have is so much better because we get on top of these things early.

Lenny (00:00:51):
Today, my guest is Megan Cook. Megan is head of product for Jira, which is used by 75% of Fortune 500 companies, 125,000 customers globally, and is by far the most popular project management tool in the world.

(00:01:06):
Megan has been at Atlassian for just under 11 years. Prior to Atlassian, Megan was an analyst, a developer, and an agile coach.

(00:01:15):
In our conversation, we discuss what Atlassian has done so right in being able to offer 15 different product lines, which many companies dream of, how they continue to stay ahead of the market in spite of the many competitors in the space, why Megan considers play so essential to building great teams and great products, a bunch of tactical advice for getting buy-in for your ideas, tips for being a successful PM in a remote environment. Also, a great story of failure, and so much more; including surfing tips. With that, I bring you Megan Cook after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:49):

(00:03:53):
Megan, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Megan Cook (00:03:57):
Thanks so much, Lenny. I am a big fan of your podcast, and I am excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:02):
I have a lot of things I want to chat about. I've heard about many things that you're extremely good at as a leader, as a product leader, and so I'm just going to poke around a bunch of different areas. I wanted to start with something that I hear you're just a big advocate of and really good at, which is creating space for play on teams and also just creating a lot of psychological safety, something that you find really important that helps your teams be as successful as they are.

(00:04:29):
Can you just talk about why this is important to you, why creating play and psychological safety are so important to you, and then just how you do this, maybe an example or two of how you actually apply this on your teams?

Megan Cook (00:04:40):
Yeah, absolutely. I think especially recently in the tech industry, it almost feels like we're going through a bit of a wake-up call at the moment. We were in this time of plenty, and everyone was hiring like crazy, and then COVID hit and suddenly people's behaviors had to really change. People couldn't travel; they had to work from home. There's a whole bunch of industries that got highly impacted by that, and it created this time of high ambiguity.

(00:05:08):
Before that, or to the start of that, I was noticing within my team just some little indicators where people weren't all comfortable to speak up when we'd had really open discussions with the most junior person, where the most senior person were happy to talk about anything. There was more anonymity in feedback. Every time things were coming to leadership to give feedback on, it was just sort of painfully polished. And I think once it gets to that level, that's a really bad time to give feedback, because it probably means that a whole ton of work has gone into it, and you might waste a whole bunch of work if you have to correct direction or make significant changes.

(00:05:53):
And so, I was looking at my team and thinking, "Yeah, something doesn't feel quite right here." And then I went to this leadership outside, and one of the speakers there was Ben Crowe. He's an expert in having the right mindset. So he works with Olympic gold medalists, and Ash Barty is another one, who's a tennis player. She's the number one tennis player in the entire world. So these athletes who have to really perform under a lot of pressure, in front of a lot of people. And he talked about how to be in that state of flow, where everything is going really well and new ideas are coming and you're making progress, you've got great momentum. And he talked about how to be in that flow state. There needs to be this sense of play and that things are fun. Your mind's open to new ideas, you feel really present. You're not stressing out and thinking about a ton of other different things.

(00:06:52):
And it's funny because when I thought about play where my mind went to the opposite of play is work. We often hear work and play as opposites together, but his point was actually that the opposite of play is fear. And I realized I think that's what I was seeing a lot of in my team and that's why the ideas were getting more incremental. So took that decision and went, okay, we need to look at psychological safety in that team or we're never going to get to some of these bigger, bolder, more innovative ideas. And so brought my group, product managers together, and we sat around and discussed it and all together came up with some ideas that we've implemented since then, which has had a really good impact. So I'll give you a couple.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Yeah, please.

Megan Cook (00:07:40):
One of the first ones was my team of PMs is big enough now where not everyone necessarily gets to know everyone else, and when you don't have that relationship, it can feel a little scary. You don't have that trust that you understand how people are going to respond to you and you're not sure about reaching out. So we divided the team into these smaller groups for peer feedback groups and the idea is that they meet every two weeks or so, somebody brings something that's in a pretty rough draft that they want to get reviewed and then everyone's expected to give feedback. And because we've got people in there who are different leadership levels, it's a really good opportunity to model the kind of feedback that's helpful and the culture there is one of everyone lifting that person up to make their work stronger.

(00:08:28):
So people can get in there, they can show that you can show work that's really in the early stages and feel comfortable with that. They can see that getting feedback can actually be really positive and they can see how all of these people together, they can rely on them and forge those relationships so they can rely on more people to help them out.

Lenny (00:08:47):
This is so interesting and it's such a good idea and it's such a simple and good idea and I'm surprised I haven't heard of people doing this before. Basically you pair up PMs, IC PMs and maybe managers too, to give each other feedback. And is the feedback on one-pagers and PRDs and strategy docs and things like that? What sort of documents are they giving feedback on?

Megan Cook (00:09:11):
So really, it can be anything. It can be here's a new experience, [inaudible 00:09:15] launching, here's a new strategy. I've taken my own strategies in there and gotten excellent feedback, surprising feedback from the team. Can be a new experiment that people think of running and anything to do with the craft.

Lenny (00:09:29):
And I think as you kind of implied, one of the powers of this approach is it's a small team, so it's less stressful and there's no... You're not in the room often too. I guess you are sometimes as you just said, but usually it's like peers and they could be a little more open and less worried about looking back.

Megan Cook (00:09:46):
Yeah, absolutely. And I think a lot of it is just building that muscle. You might go through an experience once every quarter or once every six months and that can feel really stressful, but if you're doing it again and again, you get used to it. You get used to what to expect, you get a bit more practice, it can feel much more comfortable.

Lenny (00:10:04):
That's awesome. So it's just simple and powerful idea. It's kind of like everyone's always suggesting getting a mentor, getting a coach as a PM and those are hard to find. And this is just a little informal. It's almost like a little peer group board of directors for your work. We talk about that on the podcast sometimes. So anyway, that's awesome. Really good idea and something anyone can do.

Megan Cook (00:10:24):
Yeah, thank you.

Lenny (00:10:26):
Great. Okay, you have a second idea?

Megan Cook (00:10:29):
Yeah. One of the other things we do is we get everyone together just like every six months. So all of the product managers get together in the same place and the idea is to have a bit of an onsite. Now we start off with just doing something fun because everybody... As you might know, Atlassian is a remote organization, so everybody works remote all the time. They can work from anywhere. And so people often, they're not used to necessarily being all together in the same place. It can take a little while to warm up. And then after that we talk about strategy. We do workshops on different elements of craft boosting that craft together. And so a similar kind of thing. People get to build relationships together. They get to see all these different ideas bouncing around which can help uplift their own ideas and help them be more innovative.

(00:11:23):
In this last one, I actually had some senior leaders from all over the organization come and share their stories of failure. So just to get everyone used to that idea that it's okay to fail and actually if the learnings are really good, maybe it should even be celebrated and it's not something to be scared of. And taking the big swing isn't a bad thing. It can be a really powerful way to learn as well.

Lenny (00:11:50):
I love that. We've been talking about failure a lot on this podcast, so we're super aligned with the power of that. And so just to be clear, so what you do there, is it the entire product team of Atlassian or is it just your team in this every six month?

Megan Cook (00:12:04):
It's just my team and then we pull in other product managers that we work closely with as well.

Lenny (00:12:09):
And then you fly them all to Australia, I imagine?

Megan Cook (00:12:13):
Yeah, all to Sydney

Lenny (00:12:15):
To Sydney. Amazing. Okay. And I think, so the key there is it's not just like go meet each other, it's training almost on different skill sets, helping people level up in say craft or I don't know, communication or writing or something like that. And then who teaches these things? Is it like individual team members or you bring someone in?

Megan Cook (00:12:36):
We have a real mix actually. So yeah, we'll bring in outside experts or we'll get... There's a lot of knowledge and a lot of skill within the team itself. So you'll have different product managers who have different strengths. We have totally different teams. So someone on a growth team, for example, might want to teach everyone about how to create great hypotheses or we'll get someone external from the team, but internal to Atlassian who has those skills who can come in.

Lenny (00:13:04):
I love that also gives those PMs a chance to, one, learn the skill better themselves because they're teaching it, and also just teach and present in public speaking and all that stuff. There's all these other benefits to doing that sort of thing.

Megan Cook (00:13:16):
Yeah, absolutely. And I think as a product leader, it's really important to model the behavior you want to see from your teams, whether that's getting out there teaching, presenting, explaining different concepts, explaining the business or just being vulnerable and talking about when things haven't worked out.

Lenny (00:13:34):
When we started this question, you talked about how there was kind of the shift at Atlassian where things started to feel more formal and people started to feel less open to sharing, being criticized in meetings. Just in case people might feel that might be happening in their company, do you remember roughly what size that started to happen at or signs of like, "I'm noticing people are sharing less or being more worried about talking in big meetings"?

Megan Cook (00:14:00):
Probably when we got into really different streams of work that were happening where people didn't have as much of a reason to interact with each other. So I think that was probably around, even around 15 we started to see a little bit of that.

Lenny (00:14:19):
15 product managers?

Megan Cook (00:14:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:21):
Got it. Cool. That's a good stat.

Megan Cook (00:14:24):
Yeah, you know what, I'll give one more thing that we do. So we've just started trying something new called the $10 game for priorities. And so that's where I think people might have played the $10 game for your priorities when it comes to a strategy or something like that. We started trying it out with your individual priorities. So you and your manager might come in and you can list out all of your priorities and then show you through just dividing up $10 where you're spending all of your time. And I've done this with people and we've sort of gotten down to like, "I'm putting 10 cents here this week." And I'm like, "Oh, what is that? 20 minutes, 30 minutes spending. I didn't think that's actually moving right." And so it's been great to see where people are overloaded and alignment on do my priorities stack up, but also am I spending the time on the most important things that could be moving the business forward?

Lenny (00:15:24):
Awesome. Okay. So you mentioned that y'all are remote. Has it been remote from the beginning?

Megan Cook (00:15:31):
No, not from the beginning. Actually when COVID hit, I think that was the big one.

Lenny (00:15:35):
Okay, okay, got it. That makes sense. So a lot of companies are moving to remote work, trying to figure out how to work remotely. It seems like it's working really well for Atlassian, at least from what I can see. Is there any advice or any big lessons or tips or tricks you've learned that you could share for how to be effective working remotely, especially as a product manager? It feels like as a PM, the job has gotten so much harder having to be remote, and so yeah, I'm curious if you just have any advice you could share for people trying to make this work for their company or for themselves?

Megan Cook (00:16:04):
Yeah, absolutely. It's a really good question because it's not easy and we definitely went through a whole bunch of pitfalls at the beginning, but we're really firm believers that you don't need to be in the office to build world-class products. So we call our product team anywhere, and this means that anyone Atlassian can choose where they want to work every day. We think it's a bit more human, that flexibility shouldn't be a perk, that it fundamentally can change people's lives depending on what else they have on outside of work. And so we think less about where do you work and we think more about how to be productive and effective in your work.

(00:16:44):
To your point, we started doing this right when COVID hit, so it's been about three years and actually we just released a guide with our key learnings from that. It's all about a thousand days of remote work, which folks can go and find on our Work Life blog under research@atlassian.com if they want to dive in there more. But I can give you a couple of tips from that and what we found from some of our research.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Yeah. And we'll link to that doc in the show notes.

Megan Cook (00:17:12):
Okay, great. The first one is just making time for connection. So that human connection is definitely built in person, but what we found is that it doesn't have to be something that happens every single day. So we found the connection and productivity, they both get boosted by about 30% when you bring people together but intentionally, and it lasts them months. So we found that you can do it on average like three times a year. And so that's why my PM team are getting together every six months. But in addition to that, we get the entire team together every other six months. So we end up all getting together every four times a year.

(00:17:53):
So every other six months, what we do is we get all of the engineers, designers, everybody who's working together. We book out entire floors in the office and then for an entire week we're just there. And for some of it we're just working together as you normally would, but at desks and just having those little water cooler type conversations. It builds the relationships again. Other times we're doing workshops, an important piece of work where it's easier to do when you're all in person and sometimes we're just having fun together. We call that a bit of a festival.

Lenny (00:18:27):
You mentioned that you measured some kind of productivity improvement. Do you happen to know how they measure that because that is really interesting?

Megan Cook (00:18:35):
Oh, that's a good question. I don't, but I can get that for you.

Lenny (00:18:40):
That'd be cool to know. So I think we'll keep this in the podcast episode and then if there's anything in the show notes that we link to that talks about how they measure that, that'd be really interesting because that's just a cool stat to have anyway, for all kinds of other things. I'm curious how they measure that.

Megan Cook (00:18:54):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny (00:18:56):
Okay, cool. Any other tips?

Megan Cook (00:18:58):
I think the second one is to be really intentional. I mentioned that we went through a few stumbling blocks at the start. One of those was immediately, everyone sort of filled up everybody's calendar with all of these meetings straight away. It was almost as if Lenny, if you and I were working together, I used to be able to just poke my head around my monitor and ask you something. And people were afraid that now that I can't do that, how do I get those answers? So I need more time with everybody and that definitely does not help productivity at all.

(00:19:33):
And so as PMs, we need time for creative work. We need that deep work time, and that doesn't happen when you've got all of these meetings with 30 minutes in between each of them. You need three to four hours to get that going, to get into that flow state. So my leadership team and I, we actually sync up our calendars, so we end up having these long stretches twice a week all at the same time. And so we all get a chance to do this deep work. It means we get less time for meetings, but it also means that if something comes up that's unexpected that we all need to work on together, then we've got that time there so we can be a bit more relaxed about it. We know we can get to it.

Lenny (00:20:14):
What time of the day is that meeting?

Megan Cook (00:20:16):
They're both at different times. So the first one's taking up one afternoon and the second one's taking up all of the time in the morning. Depending on what kind of person you are, one is going to see you better than the others. So we just went for one each.

Lenny (00:20:28):
I actually had the same thing just personally where I had these deep worked blocked times on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The title of the invite was, "If you book time during this, I'll slap you." And it really worked well. But I think you're talking about this other missing piece of remote work for PMs where you can't just walk by and ask an engineer, "Hey, how's it going?" Or ask a designer, "Oh, where are you at? Let me just take a peek at what you're working on." That stuff I think is really hard to replicate. And if your suggestion is block out this time for your leadership team to be able to check in with each other, is the idea there it's deep work time and don't bother anyone on the team or is it you can also just ping your end manager and like, "Hey, how's it going?"

Megan Cook (00:21:09):
The idea is that it's deep work time and it's your time to be protected to do that work. What I found that works really well, I think in the manager and report kind of relationship, so I have these really quick punchy one-on-ones with my reports every week. And then I make sure that I've got space in my calendar because something will come up where even if we had a longer one-on-one that might not cover it. They might just need an hour to run through something, there might be a really difficult strategy problem they've run into. And so they'll know that they can ping me for more time and I'll have that flex in my calendar for that.

Lenny (00:21:49):
Awesome. Any other tips along those lines?

Megan Cook (00:21:52):
Well, you probably noticed about blocking a bunch of deep work time is that you don't have as much time for meetings. So that meeting time becomes really precious. And what we do there is... I personally hate having status updates as a meeting. So I make it really clear that if we're having a meeting, this is to solve a problem. And if it's just a status update, that's fine, then I can read that asynchronously at a time that works for me. And so can everybody else in the team if they want to do that. Actually we use our own tool for this, which makes it really easy. So it's called Atlas and it lets you or the team put in status updates for a goal or a project regularly and then it'll bundle it all up into an email so you can quickly get across everything that you're interested in, which has been really helpful.

(00:22:40):
And then that just makes the documentation rigorous as well. So you document things and we use Confluence, but all of our decisions, strategies, kickoffs for projects, that's all really well documented piny starters. Or even if you're a year down the line and you're thinking, "Why didn't we come to that decision in the first place? What were our assumptions? What were our hypotheses?" It's easy to go back and take a look at that and be able to reflect.

(00:23:11):
I think the last thing is I work with people who are in the US, they're in Europe, they're all over the world. It's really hard to find a time that works for an Aussie, an American and a European to get together. Someone's waking up at 3:00 AM or something. So what's become a big part of how we work is actually audio and video recordings. I actually had someone reporting to me for a while who was in France and what we would do was record videos back and forth and they're quick. You can just use colloquial language, they're really casual, you don't have to wonder about someone's tone that comes across. So that's becoming almost like a completely new document type for us and it's been really important in remote work. You can put at the top of a document and explain the document, which is really nice. It's a big part of why we bought Loom.

Lenny (00:24:06):
I was just going to say that. It all makes sense.

Megan Cook (00:24:09):
Yeah, because it was just becoming such a big part of our life and it's just massively helpful.

Lenny (00:24:16):
Kind of along the same lines, being fully remote, it is harder to get buy-in on things you're working on I imagine. And something I hear you're great at is getting buy-in, especially getting buy-in on ideas and projects from executives. So I think things that make it extra challenging at Atlassian, there's two CEOs which I didn't know until recently. You're also all very remote and so maybe those two reasons make it extra hard. Plus it's just generally hard to get buy-in on projects that you're working on. What advice do you share with product leaders, PMs that come to you asking for advice on how to get better at getting buy-in for your ideas?

Megan Cook (00:24:56):
Yeah, this can be really hard to get right. I watch a lot of people struggle with this, and you're right, being fully remote can make it a bit more challenging. And then I think also you've got your cross-functional partners that you're working with as this tight-knit team and how do you form that relationship? But I'll start with just general buy-in.

(00:25:17):
Most of the time when people come to me and they want to ask how to get by-in, they've got a date in mind, they've got a particular meeting and they have this idea where they're going to crop this perfect proposal, they're going to present it, everyone's going to give them thumbs up and they win. And that's the wrong attitude I think even to start with to getting buy-in. It's more of a journey.

(00:25:40):
I'll give you an example where I was looking at how do people start their day in Jira and how do people get started in Jira? And we had this idea of we could craft more templates so that we could give people a better way to start with very different use cases when they came into the product. And this could change everything from even just the front homepage where they started all the way to what's happening in product. It would create this really nice flow.

(00:26:12):
Jira is also a platform as well as just Jira software the product. There's actually four different products built on top of it. So when you want to go and change something like that, you're actually changing it for all of these different products. It's not just the one. And so what was really important there was partnering with a whole bunch of different stakeholders. So every product that this could potentially negatively or positively impact, we went to very early with the idea and the proposal and we got their feedback and then we came to them and again and again as we developed it further. So as we got designs, as we got more data, as we tested things out with users, we kept coming back and we take their feedback on board.

(00:26:54):
And so I think creating those partnerships is really important. And also the same can be true at the executive level. So often you go into these meetings where you're giving a proposal and you're trying to get that final yes on the decision. You've got a lot of people in there with a lot of different angles that they can look at that problem and so much good experience to draw on. So your CTO is going to have a totally different way of looking at something and different concerns from your chief marketing officer to your head of design. They're all going to look at things differently and be thinking about it differently. And so if you know that you're going to be having a big impact in someone's space and you want to hear from them, it's good to set that meeting up early when you've got some clarity but it's not fully fleshed out and so that you can fold in some of their concerns because they'll have this much broader view. And that also creates people who will be an advocate for you once you get into that room, that final meeting.

(00:27:50):
So I think all of those in the lead up, there's a lot of lead up work to getting buy-in that makes sure that you have a good time in that meeting.

Lenny (00:28:00):
Just to maybe summarize so far, which you've shared, one is just... Basically it's lieu people in early, especially the person that it's going to impact most.

Megan Cook (00:28:08):
I think in addition to that is having that mindset of being open to not necessarily coming up with the right solution, it's more about solving for the problem or the opportunity. So you want to be clear about your hypotheses and what are your facts and what are the principles you're using to make a decision and just be open to not necessarily ending up with the solution you thought would be best.

Lenny (00:28:34):
I imagine most people think they are always in that state, "I am very open to feedback. I am totally open-minded, but really they're not." Is there anything that you think would either convince someone you're actually not as open-minded as you seem or any advice for how to come across as more open-minded? Or is there anything that you see... I see this all the time. People think they're listening, but they're not. You should change.

Megan Cook (00:28:56):
I think one way to force yourself into that situation is to be clear about the hypotheses you have and the facts. So I think often people can present as, "This is absolutely the case. This is what I know, and this is obviously the correct response to the situation." Where most of the time you've got a good set of data, you've got a good understanding with your knowledge of the space, but what is actually going to happen is a hypothesis. There's always going to be something you don't know and oftentimes you don't know until you ship it. That is absolutely the best test of whether or not what you thought was going to happen will actually happen.

(00:29:41):
And so I think when you come to the meeting going, okay, here's the top-back so we actually know, and here's the hypotheses and here's my plan to prove or disprove them, then you're exposing your idea for people to go, oh, here's more that I know about that hypotheses, or here's some data that you don't have or here's another way to think about it. I think people can feel like they're not going to be credible. That you have to come in, you have to come in confident, you have to come in knowing exactly what that solution is going to be. But I usually find that if you come in there open and you're exposed, you're thinking and where you could use some help on perspectives, that actually that builds more credibility because everyone knows that you are not going to have all the answers and you're not going to be able to see the future. And so that can really help in building people's trust in you and that you know what you're doing.

Lenny (00:30:34):
Is there an example of that that comes to mind to make it even more real of either someone on your team doing that or you doing that? Because I think it's still going to be hard for people to realize, "Hey, I'm not actually paying attention to anyone and I just want to convince them this idea is right. This is what we're doing. Just come on, get out of my way. Give me the okay."

Megan Cook (00:30:51):
An example from my past is there was this potential acquisition that we could have made, and I was really, really keen on it because it would mean adding a whole bunch of much needed capability really quickly to the product. And I just loved that momentum and I didn't see any other way that we could do this. I'd looked at a bunch of other options about building it in-house and it just didn't seem possible. And there were a few people that I needed to convince, my boss, but also the head of engineering for the area. And when I took it to them, what I learned was the head of engineering was able to pull a bunch of people from other areas within the company to come and bolster this effort and who had all of the knowledge that we needed. So what seemed like the impossible task, he actually had this extra knowledge to make possible.

(00:31:45):
And in the end, acquisition or not, that doesn't really matter. It's more about being able to get that value back to our customers. That's what we're solving for. And so it was really about coming back, not falling in love with that solution and that other company, it was just taking a step back and going, "Okay, well, really it's just what are we here to do? What's the real goal at the end of the day?"

Lenny (00:32:11):
Awesome. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to share along these lines before I move on to a different topic?

Megan Cook (00:32:16):
The other thing I would say is that setting up the meeting when you finally get there can be really important as well. I often see people go in there and they've got a big document or a presentation or something and they just launch into it. They're really excited. But actually you want to take a step back and you want to be really clear on what are you looking for from that group. You can ask for the decision, you can ask for feedback, you can ask for... You can expose where you're not quite sure about something and you want them to be thinking about that angle in particular and helping test that hypothesis with what they know. And so setting that early, you can put that in people's heads as they read through your document or listen to the rest of the proposal.

(00:33:02):
Then I find it's really useful to have a narrative that just encompasses everything that you're going to talk about. So just really brief, what's the current situation, what has changed and what are the implications that you now want to... We mean we have a problem to solve and an opportunity that we can go after.

(00:33:21):
And the last thing is just making sure you've got your data. There's executives, there's people in the meeting. They're usually across a whole ton of stuff just hearing about... Maybe they've got 10 proposals a day and they're across all different areas in the business, and so they're not going to have the detail that you do. So being really thoughtful about what you bring, what are the key points that are going to help them understand the situation as clearly as possible. But then really knowing your data so that you can dive in more detail where they need it. And that also helps build your credibility and builds people's confidence in the plan to go ahead.

Lenny (00:34:05):
Would you mind just quickly summarizing these pieces of advice and then I was going to move on to another area of strength of yours that I hear?

Megan Cook (00:34:13):
Yeah, sure. So the first one is to find people who are affected negatively or positively or might have a really good point of view and partner with them as you develop the solution or the response to the current situation. And the second one is to come at it with this mindset of being open, of being really key on what is the core problem or the value that you want to deliver, and just being open to how you get there and things that you don't know which might adjust along the way. And the last one is just setting up the meeting walls. So coming in, making sure that it's very clear what you need. Do you need a decision or something like that? And making sure that you've got very good supporting data to build that credibility with your audience.

Lenny (00:35:03):
Love it. This is where the term or the cliche of product managers asking, "But what problem are we trying to solve," comes from. But it comes from a really important place of always focusing on let's all align on here's the problem we're solving. Because oftentimes as you chatted about, the biggest disagreements come from people just thinking they're solving different problems. And on that note, I have a Swag Store now, lennyswag.com, and we have stickers on there, a bunch of cliche PM terms including, "But what problem are we trying to solve?" And so I think that's... But it's rooted in, that's actually a really important question to ask. Sometimes you get annoying.

Megan Cook (00:35:38):
Yeah, that's such a good sticker to have front and center.

Lenny (00:35:42):
Just need that as a big sign. Maybe the sticker needs to be bigger.

Megan Cook (00:35:44):
Exactly.

(00:36:45):
Okay, something else that I hear you're incredibly good at, and it's actually related to all of these things we've been talking about, is the way someone described you is you're really good at fighting the good fight, which essentially is just doing the things that need to be done that aren't necessarily popular or that people are prioritizing right now. I hear that you led to a big investment in CSAT at Atlassian because you just felt like this was the right way of doing it. And there's a few other projects that came out of just like, "I'm just going to do the thing that needs to be done." Can you just talk about why that's important to you, what impact that sort of had, and then just how you actually successfully do that? Obviously it ties into this skill of getting buy-in on stuff.

Megan Cook (00:37:24):
I think that's a really good example actually, the CSAT example, because sometimes you can get caught up in let's add value, add value, add value to the product, but if the customer aren't satisfied with what you built, or in our case we found that one of the core reasons was the usability, it wasn't where it needed to be. Then we can't access that value anyway. It doesn't matter. And sometimes it can be hard to get investment for things like that because it's not like the shiny, exciting new thing. It's no, I want to work on the features we already have and improve those. So it was about two years ago, our chief experience officer, he cared really deeply about improving our CSAT scores and asked me to look into it. And this-

Lenny (00:38:12):
Briefly explain CSAT real quick. Some people may not be familiar with that term.

Megan Cook (00:38:17):
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. Of course. CSAT means customer satisfaction. So for us, we actually have a survey so that we can measure CSAT and it just asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with the product and then different aspects so we can see for different tasks that they need to perform or different aspects of it, like the reliability or the speed or the usability. How do customers feel about that?

Lenny (00:38:48):
We actually had a podcast episode recently Judd, where we talking about NPS and how much there's data showing it's not actually a great predictor of anything, and he's a big fan of CSAT instead. So you could almost think of it as little replacement for NPS in a lot of cases. And I'm sorry, pushed you off track. Keep going.

Megan Cook (00:39:05):
Yeah, no worries. So he cared really deeply about this, asked me to look into it. Even though this request was coming from the top, that doesn't mean that it gets any sort of funding. So we went through a couple of different steps to see what was worth investing in here. First of all, I mentioned we had that survey and so we had really rich feedback. So it's not just a rating, what we get, we get people talking about why they gave that rating and that can really help us zero in on what are the key aspects that's bringing this down. And we also had great conversations with our customers. It was the kinds of conversations that are really rich and really helpful, but so painful to listen to and go through because you're seeing somebody really struggle with something that you thought was going to bring them so much value.

(00:39:58):
And then we had a look at, well, what is this going to impact? And so logically it's what we found was that usability was one of the key reasons, like I said. And logically, if your product is hard to use in places, if some of the core actions are hard for people to do, then a new user to that product or a new customer is going to have a longer ramp up time. You've got a harder time showing them that there's value. And even for an existing customer that's using your product really well, when they bring on a new user, that user might have a really hard time getting up to speed and using it and it just completely slows them down. So from a business point of view, it can impact your new customer acquisition as well as your ability to expand. So there was some good revenue connections in there as well.

(00:40:52):
What I also found was that we have a lot of dependencies. So we've got all of these platform teams and a lot of the improvements that would be really good to make to sort out this problem depended on many, many teams around Atlassian. And they all had different goals and other products that they had to serve too. I don't know if you've ever tried to align three or four different roadmaps so that the timing is just right to get some improvement through, but it's basically impossible. There was no way that was going to happen. But we did find that they were really passionate about this area and improving usability. So we worked together to find a low cost way for those teams to help us make the changes that we need to, but they didn't have to bear the brunt of all the development costs.

(00:41:39):
So each of those teams flipped forward, we call them a shepherd, so that as our developers came in and made changes in the code base that this shepherd would make sure that they weren't causing any issues and we're doing reviews and reviews of designs and things like that. And so getting that buy-in, finding the data to support the reason why this was important. And then we constructed the roadmap so that we found this sort of a low cost, very cheap way to have some impactful change early on. I think that was really, really important. And so we put together just some of the designs for what the experiences were going to look like.

(00:42:24):
So our head of design, Charlie Sutton at the moment has this great mantra of show don't tell. And in this case, it was just at the core of getting people excited because you could show the initial experience, you could show the pain, you could bring in a video of the customer trying to use it and what they thought of it. And that just really brought that emotional aspect to it. It helped get people on board on the issue, the new experience, which is just far and away molds better, might cut out like 20 clicks or whatever. And so all that worked together to get the investment that we needed.

(00:43:04):
I think the last thing that was useful there actually is that we started pretty small too. So I think if you have a hypothesis and you can start small, you can get that investment more easily, you can show success, you can always build on that in the future to get more and more. But in this case, we got about 40 people to come and join onto this. And then as we shipped things, we just made sure that it kept being quite small. And so we got that momentum really quickly. We kept with regular updates, we kept up the excitement about what the team was doing.

(00:43:38):
At one stage, the team picked out something that was pretty impactful throughout the whole thing. So that was dark mode. That took a lot of coordination around the whole company to make that thing happen. But it was well overdue, we loved it. And then the feedback that we got as well really helps with that. Actually just yesterday, I saw some feedback on one of the changes we'd made recently, and this customer said it was the best quality of life improvement they've seen in a long time, which just the way that's phrased even, that gets you excited about the impact that you're having on that person.

Lenny (00:44:20):
And this was the CSAT work or the dark mode?

Megan Cook (00:44:24):
This was CSAT work. This was improving one of the processes.

Lenny (00:44:28):
Okay, cool. That's amazing. There's a lot of stuff I love about this story. One is just the power of just empowering yourself to do things that you believe need to be done. There's a lot of PMs and just people in general that just assume they don't have any power and the square peg they're in is just all they're going to be able to do and nobody's going to allow them to do things that they believe are important and no one else agrees with. So I think there's just a lot of power in just understanding that you have more power and leverage and agency than you probably think you do, but then you also have to do it well. So I took a bunch of notes as you were talking of the things that I think are core to getting stuff like this done, just a scrappy project that you're kind of doing on your own without a lot of buy-in from the top initially.

(00:45:14):
So I want to stay small. Two is make it visual and visceral so you can like, "Oh wow, I could see this being amazing," and getting people excited as you go. Making it really easy for people I think is a really interesting takeaway there. Just like, "We did all the work for you already for these other teams, it's going to be so easy. It's not going to be a lot of work for you." And then showed the data like, "Here's what we've gotten from CSAT so far, here's the impact you'll probably get from it. Here's how much work it'll take." Show actual data. And then keep it scrappy. It feels like a lot of this is just like stay small, keep it scrappy, don't ask for a lot of resources initially and just kind of show momentum.

Megan Cook (00:45:50):
I think that's really important. When you keep it scrappy and small in the beginning, it doesn't feel like it's as big of a bet, but that gives you the opportunity to really prove that the direction that you're going in could pay off. And so it's sort of like this little inroad to getting more investment.

Lenny (00:46:07):
Awesome. Okay. I want to move to a different topic around Atlassian as a company, but is there anything else you wanted to share along those lines before we do that?

Megan Cook (00:46:15):
No, let's go for it.

Lenny (00:46:17):
Okay. One of the most interesting things about Atlassian to me is it's a great example of a company that's been able to launch new product lines. This is the dream of every software company business in general is you start with one product that gets to a certain point and then you hit some kind of plateau, and then you add an additional business product line, and then you add more and more. Somewhere around Atlassian's 15 products. Is that an accurate number?

Megan Cook (00:46:43):
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we are up to 15. Yes.

Lenny (00:46:45):
Jesus Christ. Amazing. So this is very rare and the dream of many companies. And so I'm just curious what it is you think Atlassian has done so right to have so many successful individual products?

Megan Cook (00:46:59):
You know what, it's not like we added the first product and got it just right way off the bat. So yeah, 15, we've had a lot of shots at this, so I might talk about two examples. I think the first one, if I think about Jira software, it started just as a really humble bug tracker. That was it. There wasn't as much to it, and then it sort of weathered these massive changes in how people build software. So it launched in 2003. And if I remember correctly, just to date this, the mobile phone that was most popular at the time was the Nokia 6100. I don't know if you ever had one of those.

Lenny (00:47:41):
I don't remember what that specific one was, but I'm picturing a Nokia phone. It's like a little small brick.

Megan Cook (00:47:47):
Yeah, it was my mother-in-law's favorite phone. It took us forever to get her off that onto something better. But there's a lot that's changed since that time. There's been agile, there's been cloud. And what we saw recently was more in the expansion of software teams. So they used to be extremely developer centric. And I think most people when they think about Jira software, they think, oh, that must be, well, 80% developers that are using it. But actually it's more like 50% or maybe just shy of 50% are developers. And the rest is this huge mix of support in operations, in sales and marketing, finance, design, HR, legal, just this massive mix of everybody, all the roles you could think of in a company basically that get in there and make work happen.

(00:48:36):
And so what we saw years ago was, well, software teams aren't just developers anymore. And we saw this in our teams as well, but we saw that these other teams, the finance, the marketing teams, even design teams were sort of cobbling together their own solutions. So Jira software is incredibly flexible, which is a massive pro of it. That these teams were seeing software teams get more effective at the way they were getting work done and collaborating better. And they wanted that same benefit and they started using Jira, but we hadn't set it up well for them at all. So it was quite difficult for them to do that. But the positive was that there was this really good signal from our users that they were looking for more from us, and we knew that your marketing team is going to work differently from your developer team. That's how it should be. And so we started Jira work management to be more focused on all of these other use cases outside of the software team that our users were asking us to go ahead and solve.

(00:49:36):
So that was a really great way to discover the need for a new product. Were these really strong signals from within our customers in that same area of business that we're really well set up to help them learn.

Lenny (00:49:50):
What was that process like from noticing, "Hey, designers are using Jira and they're not having a good time. PMs are using Jira, researchers, and here's the issues they're running." So just that insight of like, "Oh, interesting. There might be an opportunity here to launching." I don't know the first version. I don't know if you're actually involved in this, but whatever you can share would be awesome. Where there design partners they all chose and like let's work with Salesforce and Microsoft and make sure they love it? How long was that process? Because I think that's the prop people are so curious about just how do we validate and discover and then actually launch something that's going to work.

Megan Cook (00:50:28):
Yeah, I was just as close to that one, but I can give you a second example.

Lenny (00:50:33):
Oh, great.

Megan Cook (00:50:35):
Yeah, for sure. The second example actually came from our product internal innovation program and that we let anyone pitch an idea for new product in the company if they want to. So we had this wonderful product manager, Tammy Carson, who saw a demand for a solution for product managers to build their roadmaps a bit better before ideas get committed. So as you know, this is fuzzy area before you actually start building something as a product manager where you're looking at lots of opportunities and ideas and you're prioritizing them. And it's not really confirmed real work yet. And nobody wanted to put that in Jira because once it was in Jira, then everyone just expected it to happen. And so this is where Jira product discovery came from.

(00:51:24):
And in the past we'd tried things like this before in new products at Atlassian and they've been successful, but it'd been really hard because large parts of the company process and those checks were optimizing for the success of the bigger products like Jira software. And so we changed that to create really small groups with stage gates that we call wonder, explore, make, impact, and then getting to scale. And that meant to assess those bets at every stage. And the idea was to iterate really quickly, either to it not working out and proving that it couldn't be a business or iterate really quickly to yes it could and we should invest more in this. And so with each stage there would be a little bit of investment.

(00:52:12):
So you say that for a stage of wonder might just be the person with the idea. And then explore, you might add on a couple more people, like three people to go and really have a look at, here's a prototype, here are some customers that'd be interested in it and could help us think about this some more and put together what the roadmap looks like. And then when you get to make that's when you get a full team, but a full team is going to be 12 people or so, it's still not huge. And I think that's really important because at each stage you're getting validation, you're getting more customers who are interested and invested in helping you develop what that solution looks like.

(00:52:56):
You asked about whether we went and partnered with a partner company like Salesforce for something like this, for a new product. In this case it was just really partnering heavily with our customers where we saw that interest coming through in our other products like Jira software and building something that really works for them before expanding it to more and more customers and finding that product market fit and then upping the investment. And so we've had a couple of new products recently that have gone through that sort of stage rollout. So there's Jira Product Discovery, there's Atlas that I mentioned before, and I think Compass is the latest one.

Lenny (00:53:36):
So what I'm hearing here is essentially there's this step-by-step gated process that you put new product ideas through and they make it one step at a time. And I imagine there's a leader that can decide, "No, this one's not working out. Let's end it at the explorer phase and invest in other ideas." I imagine

Megan Cook (00:53:56):
Yeah, that's right. It might be someone who's looking after that particular market. At each one of those stages, there's that check on whether or not we continue to go ahead.

Lenny (00:54:08):
And the stages are wonder. I like that a lot. That's a great name. Explore, make, and then what were the other ones?

Megan Cook (00:54:16):
Impact and scale.

Lenny (00:54:18):
Got it. So impact is like is it showing any impact? We made it, is it working? And then scale. Got it. That makes sense. Just like let's go for it.

Megan Cook (00:54:25):
Yeah. Impact could be I can be self-sufficient in the revenue that I'm generating, and scale is just really launching it to take off.

Lenny (00:54:35):
Launch it. Yeah, it goes on the website. Okay. So wonder is like a PM and an engineer maybe at Hackathon where we have an idea. Explore is they maybe get a little bit of resourcing and they start exploring the idea, build the prototype, maybe find a design partner too, to think about this. Is that roughly right?

Megan Cook (00:54:52):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:52):
Okay.

Megan Cook (00:54:52):
Make sure you've got a clear roadmap. Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:54):
Okay, got it. And then make, is that where they expand it to a few more customers and make it more fully featured?

Megan Cook (00:55:04):
Yeah. Make is where you'd actually build it. So the prototype-

Lenny (00:55:09):
Okay, got it.

Megan Cook (00:55:10):
... could be pretty simple, could be a bit cobbled together, make is actually building the product and see if you can get more and more customers.

Lenny (00:55:14):
Got it.

Megan Cook (00:55:15):
That's where you'd start to make it with those customers.

Lenny (00:55:19):
This is really interesting because again, I think Atlassian is one of the very few companies that has done this so well. And I don't know, this number is absurd. I've never heard of another company that's 15 successful products. I don't know how successful they're, but they're out there and people seem to be... They're being promoted. I guess is there any other advice to share along the lines of if someone is thinking about launching a second product, anything you would suggest they do or think about they may not be thinking about?

Megan Cook (00:55:42):
I think my advice is skied towards the Atlassian case, which is where you're in a 12,000 strong employee company and how do you seed something that you want to run as more with more of a startup kind of mindset. So when you get to this size, you've got quarterly planning and business reviews and all of these different process and you don't necessarily want to put your seed startup through that. It's not quite ready for that kind of thing. So I think the key things here that make it really successful is starting really small with the idea and the solution to be proved and don't add too many people, don't feel pressured to add too many people. I think it's easy to get really excited about the potential and just want to throw four or five teams at it, but that can... We were talking about this stat. That can make things run slower and so you want to protect them.

(00:56:39):
And the second thing is just give them freedom to move really fast and solve those problems in a different way. So there are different expectations. They don't necessarily need to be a part of that process that I was talking about before. This team should just be running hard to prove whether or not the idea's going to work and whether there's product market fit.

(00:56:59):
And for different approaches. If I want to add something to Jira software, but we're talking millions and millions of users there, that thing has to be resilient. It's got to scale. There are all these things that users inherently expect from something like that. But for something small like this, we are proving product market fit. You don't need to think about that initially. So you've got to hold this to a different standard, otherwise you're just going to slow them down way too much.

(00:57:25):
And actually we found that by letting them tackle problems a little differently, we found innovative way of looking at things that we can pull back into our other products. So for example, if you look at Jira Product Discovery, and just the way that it gives more of a spreadsheet kind of view of a list of ideas and things like that, some of the experience there is definitely something that we'll be pulling into Jira software.

Lenny (00:58:00):
You mentioned that over the years, Jira has weathered many storms. From my perspective, it feels like it continues to weather many storms incredibly well. One, because there's just endless startups always coming at Jira trying to become the new project management tool that everyone uses. And two, it just feels like people are always dissing on Jira like, "Jira sucks, I want to use something else." On the other hand, it continues to dominate. Many people love it. I'm curious what you believe Atlassian generally has done and your team has done to keep Jira ahead of everyone. And I know you're probably going to say, "We listen to customers better than anyone." So if that's a big part of the answer, definitely share that. But I'm curious, is there anything else people may not be recognizing of just why Jira has been so successful for so long?

Megan Cook (00:58:46):
Yeah. I think the number of startups that enter this space, just so it shows how important the problem is that we solve and that problem of teamwork and collaboration. We've got more than 125,000 customers around the world who start their day in Jira, millions of users and the kinds of companies that use it. I just love hearing about what they do with it. They really blow me away. Like NASA landing the Mars rover or Canva building this design platform for 40 million people, it's just massive.

Lenny (00:59:23):
I don't think you can beat that Mars rover story array. That's a good one. I think when you follow it up with the Canvas story, that one's less interesting now, but it's also amazing. Okay. Sorry. Keep going.

Megan Cook (00:59:33):
So like you said, they are integral to our success. We do obsess over them. We think if we do right by them, then we're going to be going in the right direction. I don't think we've ever had this sense of arrogance of just... No matter how big we are, we've always got this healthy dose of paranoia that we need to keep working on improving things and being better. So to your point about customer feedback, that is a big part of it. We bake in these rituals just to make it super easy for everyone to do that. So the whole company gets an email every week and it's just got a random selection of feedback from our customers. It's got how they rate us and just a quote as well. And so everyone's sort of getting this dose of feedback all the time.

(01:00:24):
We have regular share outs of all of the research that everyone gets. We get in-product feedback. We make it super easy to talk to our customers through social media or LinkedIn or X now. And then we also have a whole community space where customers can have longer conversations with us about different ideas that we're coming up with or feedback that they have for us. So I think that is all massively important for keeping Jira ahead of the pack.

(01:00:58):
I think how we stay ahead in other areas is just that the culture is super, super open to innovation, kind of invites innovation. So we have these hackathons, we call them shepherd. The whole company stops and everyone can play with new ideas or technologies. It's a competition. So the best ideas get visibility. It can get people working with other people that they wouldn't normally. And also the visibility of the ideas helps generate more ideas all over the place.

(01:01:31):
Like I said before, innovation can come from anywhere. So anyone can pitch new ideas or products. And when we see new technologies emerging that we think are going to be really foundational and interesting, we'll carve off a team to go and look at that. So I think we've had an AI team central to Atlassian for a long time, but with the advent of ChatGPT, there's sort of this huge move forward. There's this leak that's happening. And so in my team, I just carved off a small team to go and explore that and see what interesting things that we could do there.

(01:02:09):
I think we don't shy away from tackling subsets of the market that we're seeing that need a bit more love, like the Jira Product Discovery story that we were just talking about a second ago. And we also use our products a lot and that helps us find all of those little problems and makes it really real. We get really excited about the different things that the whole team is working on. We send lots of feedback to each other. I think that's also a really important part of it.

(01:02:42):
Another area is when we look at how we're investing, there's always this pressure to invest in the core business, of course, but we also make sure that we invest in seeding future businesses. And like we're talking about, they might not always work out. So we had then the Compass and the Atlas example of ones that have worked out, but we also see things through Atlassian inventions. So if there are interesting ideas or technologies, these might support the products later on, that's something that we'll go and seed out there in the market. And that's led to a few acquisitions there as well, which has been really useful.

(01:03:21):
And the last thing is I think I am just really impressed at the way that we stay agile to move towards these different shifts that come up. It always surprises me just how agile we can be. For example, in 2020 we decided to double down on our mission to deliver a world-class cloud experience. And it was like hundreds of people just moved around in Atlassian to make that happen, which was in a very short period of time, which was impressive. And we're not shy about killing things off with their [inaudible 01:03:55]. So I'll give you another example of one of those products that was going through that we ended up killing off. So we had a whiteboard product that we thought would be its own product, sort of like a Jira Product Discovery. And when we came to one of those gates with the team, we realized actually this is more a really useful document type. And so now you'll see that it's a feature in Confluence. It was very quick to make that decision.

Lenny (01:04:28):
I have this new segment, not that new anymore, called Failure Corner. I'm curious if you have any interesting story of a big failure in your career. And if you do, what you learned from that experience?

Megan Cook (01:04:41):
I think I'll give you a bit of a different one because I think this one is harder to spot and I think that's really interesting. It's something that I think about all the time though. So I missed a really big opportunity to move Atlassian forward back in the day. And I, like I said, think about it every time I review a new idea or look at an opportunity that we're thinking about.

(01:05:06):
So I was on this team and I was improving the way that our products help developers get their work done. And so typically we saw them start in Jira software. They'd pick up a piece of work and then they'd switch tools. They'd create a brand, they'd start writing code. And we noticed that they would forget to come back and update the status of their work and this could create a lot of confusion in the team. Another developer could pick up that work thinking it wasn't started and then there was a lot of wasted time. Or if you're trying to track metrics like how long does it take for a piece of work to get started through to done? That'll totally ski things. So this was causing a lot of problems.

(01:05:42):
But we didn't want to make developers come back into the tool that was obviously something that was getting in the way of their work. So we decided to build automation so they didn't have to leave their ID or the command line to do that. They can just keep working. So an example is Jira would detect that a new command had been created and then it could automatically move your piece of work to in progress because there's code being written against it. And there were a whole bunch of these examples that parties integrated into it and I made the decision to put into Jira as a user was editing their workflow and we shipped it and it performed just fine. People discovered it, they used it, and seemed to give a lot of value. People liked it, which doesn't really sound like a fail. I don't think that...

(01:06:33):
Where I dropped the ball was more about what I should have realized about that feature. So automation, it's super useful. It can be used by a whole slew of people who aren't just developers. It could be used in every single product. It's more than just moving things to a new status. And so I should have realized that we could have built this amazing service that every product could have moved themselves forward with. And years later, Atlassian actually acquired a company that did exactly that, this advanced automation. And it's in every product now. And so you can imagine how much it costs to acquire a company. That was a really extensive mistake on my part. So when I see a new idea, I'm always asking myself, "How do we push this further? Is there something there that we can 10X? Can we apply it more broadly to more types of users, more products? Is there some bigger opportunity that we can really take advantage of?"

Lenny (01:07:31):
That's an awesome story. So the lesson there is just think bigger with the products. You almost need to wait for it to first be successful for you just to be like, "Oh, but can we do something more with this?" Do you think you should have been thinking about that as you were building it or would that have been too early?

Megan Cook (01:07:47):
No, I think I should have caught that as we were building it, because even when I think about the experience, so it was a really good proving ground for it for sure. But even when I think about the experience, just where that experience was designed and product limited its functionality, which is a real shame.

Lenny (01:08:07):
I guess the takeaway there is just if you're committing to some idea, ask yourself what would it look like if this was 10 times bigger? If this was a bigger deal, can this apply to other things we're doing? Is that right?

Megan Cook (01:08:21):
Yeah. Where could this go in three years, five years? And should that change the way that you think about it now?

Lenny (01:08:29):
Great advice. Megan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or is there anything you wanted to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Megan Cook (01:08:39):
I'll leave you with something. And it's just this practice that I've found really useful for my squad that we've implemented pretty recently, and especially with remote work and all of that. So like I said, we have limited time together, but what we put into place is something we called Fight Club. I'll probably get in trouble for talking about Fight Club. The first rule is you don't talk about fight club.

Lenny (01:09:05):
Everyone knows that.

Megan Cook (01:09:08):
It's 30 minutes every week. And it's just for myself, my engineering and my design leader, and we get together and we know that we're going in there to have a conflict. I think often when there's difficult conversations or those conflicts come up, you can put them off until they become much bigger. Or if somebody is conflict adverse, they can try to avoid having it at all. But by having a specific sort of time in your week for something like that, then you're sort of in that mindset. You know you're going in there to solve a hard problem. You know that there's going to be a disagreement and it makes it much better. And I think the relationship we all have is so much better because we get on top of these things early.

Lenny (01:09:53):
This is super cool. It's like couples therapy or something where you're just like, "What issues do we have? Let's work through them right now." I love that. I love that. And it makes it okay to bring up things that are bothering you and things that you think need to change. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Megan Cook (01:10:12):
Yes, can't wait. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:10:14):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Megan Cook (01:10:19):
Look, I have a habit of sending books to everyone who reports to me every year just on a skill they're working on. So I've got a huge list that I actually send out, but the one that I send out the most to new PMs especially is just inspired by Marty Cagan. It holds up really well. It was recommended to me by my first boss, and it's just got a bunch of great tips in there, just great foundational knowledge.

(01:10:49):
More recently, what I've been sending out for my managers is Scaling People by Claire Hughes Johnson. I think that just came out within the last year actually, but it's just got an incredible amount of really useful tactical things, templates, all sorts of things that you can put into practice.

Lenny (01:11:11):
Great choices. We have both in the bookshelf behind me. Both of them have been on the podcast. I wish I could see the whole list of books that you recommend to people. If you don't have this written out anywhere, you should publish some kind of blog or newsletter post of here's the skill and here's the book you recommend.

Megan Cook (01:11:26):
Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Thanks.

Lenny (01:11:29):
Right, you have a homework assignment. Okay, next question. What is the favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Megan Cook (01:11:35):
I am so late to TV, but Foundation is the one that I've been binging lately, and I think it's just this huge world. And I'm not usually one that gets super into sci-fi, but the way that it brings forward some of these ideas for what new technologies could mean... If you haven't seen it, and this is really spoiling it, one of the main characters or three of the main characters are actually clones of this emperor who rules the universe and decided to clone himself at three different stages of his life so that those people could continue rolling. And I think even that idea just invites the idea of what if we stretched out human life? What are the impact? How do things advance when you've got that same mindset and same people continue on? It's super compelling.

Lenny (01:12:28):
Foundation, the show got ruined for me by reading the books many, many years ago, is one of my favorite sci-fi trilogy of all time. And then I was so excited for the show and has nothing to do with the books, basically. It's like the storyline is completely different, the core idea is the same as the only real. So I just got tired of it and stopped. But if you haven't read the books, I think you would love it. It's beautiful.

Megan Cook (01:12:50):
Are the books better?

Lenny (01:12:53):
Yeah, the books are better. The books are always better, I think is a good rule of thumb.

Megan Cook (01:13:00):
Yeah, that is a good rule. I'll probably pick that up.

Lenny (01:13:00):
Yeah. I was like a teenager when I read them, so I don't know. Maybe they suck, but I think people love them. Highly recommend the books if you liked the show especially. Next question, do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates?

Megan Cook (01:13:12):
I think it's an old one, but a great one on the subject of failure. I love to ask people about their biggest failure and I think it's a good way to get to know somebody because you can see how introspective they are, how much they think about what's happened and what they learned from it. It shows whether or not they can be vulnerable with you. You can see what they consider to be a big failure. Some people will list something that's not really a failure. And also you can see about whether they've got that growth mindset. So have they learned something from that? Have they applied it moving forward?

(01:13:51):
Weird rule that I've found is that a lot of the best hires that I've had has had big failure stories that they've worked through and learned from. And so I think that's great to see what they consider there, what the learnings are, but also in the solution you can also see how they tackle something like that. So are they the type of person who wants to go and forge something all by themselves? Are they the type of person who will pull together a community to figure something out? So you get that insight into their values and their approach from that question too, which is hugely useful.

Lenny (01:14:30):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Megan Cook (01:14:34):
Yeah. You might have to stop me from going on and on about this, but I recently got a smoker, a Traeger smoker for smoking meat. And just the unboxing experience was incredible. So you get this huge box, cardboard box, you open it up. If you reverse the cardboard box, it becomes like a play saloon that your kid can jump into and just mess around in which-

Lenny (01:15:02):
Wow, that's cool.

Megan Cook (01:15:03):
... rather than just throwing it out, it becomes something really cool and useful. The set of instructions has a six-pack of beer at the top, just helps you understand how far through you should be through your six-pack as you're constructing it. You get some tools with it. And they're really good actually. They're not the usual kind of throwaway tools that you get in something to put together something like this. In addition to that sort of playful delightfulness in there, as you build it, you discover things along the way. So I opened up the hopper where you put in your wood pellets and there was a baseball cap, a tray of baseball cap in there, which was unexpected and really cool. And then the whole experience of actually using it once you've set it up is amazing. So it's all connected to my phone. I can just head to the beach and have some brisket going and come home and it's beautifully done. It just works. It's integrated. It's got integrated recipes. Yeah, I love that. I like that one.

Lenny (01:16:12):
And salt. That sounds so delightful. Such a great product experience. I'm going to have to get one I think. I think we're going to sell some Traeger smokers.

Megan Cook (01:16:17):
Sure.

Lenny (01:16:22):
Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, either in work or in life?

Megan Cook (01:16:28):
It's around maximizing joy. And what I mean by that is it's about finding what's important and leaning into it or finding what's annoying and turning it into something I enjoy. To give you a super small example is I'm terrible with keys. I will leave that thing all over the place. You'll find it in my cutlery drawer or whatever, and I'll never find it again. And I think an obvious solution to that could be to put a hook on the wall or something where you can just leave them and you go back to that and it's easy to find. But what gives me joy is not actually having to have keys at all. And so now I have a fingerprint reader on my front door and I feel a little bit like James Bond every time I enter my house and I can let people in if somebody needs to leave a package or something that's easy to do. So it was turning something annoying into something more joyful.

(01:17:24):
And I think the other thing there is just I really value keeping great relationships and increasing those relationships. And so I always make time for these amazing friends that I have that live in London, and we have this pact where every time either one of us goes to the others' continent, we'll go meet them there. So every time I go to Europe, which last year I was in Berlin, at one point in Amsterdam, and on the plane, they came over and we just hung out and had a great time. And so it's making sure that you make time for those important things.

Lenny (01:18:00):
Along the same lines, final question related to creating more joy. I noticed a beautiful surfboard behind you. For somebody that's trying to surf and maybe not being successful, what's one tip you could share with listeners to improve their success with surfing?

Megan Cook (01:18:18):
Isn't surfing the most humbling sport that you've ever tried?

Lenny (01:18:22):
Yeah, I've tried a few times and yeah, I would say so.

Megan Cook (01:18:29):
I think surfing's really interesting. I've never done a sport like it in that it's something that you have to really feel. So I find every time you learn and you think about surfing, you sort of feel it before you know how to do it. So even just being able to catch a wave, a green pace wave, you're paddling, you're paddling, you don't quite know where to be, you don't quite know how much to paddle for that wave, and you just have to sort of be successful a couple times before you get the feel for it. And it's the same with trying to find the right wave. When I looked at the ocean the first time to try and pick the wave and pick where to be, I couldn't even see the shape of it to find that right place. It took me just seeing a hundred waves to be able to do that.

(01:19:15):
So my best tip for surfing is get out there, keep doing it, do it over and over and over again. You will get better. You'll start to see all of these things that you've never noticed before. And get some friends. Get some friends out there, get surfing accountability buddy to make sure that you're getting out there often.

Lenny (01:19:37):
He's the best buddy. Amazing. Megan, we've talked about play and safety and buy-in and fighting the good fight and adding new product lines, also surfing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on some stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Megan Cook (01:19:55):
The best place to find me is on LinkedIn. I'm Megan Cook on LinkedIn. You can also find me if you're a customer in the Atlassian community, if you want to have a chat. And I'm also on social media, so on X, you can find me there as well. And be useful to me. Look, any feedback, absolutely any feedback on Jira software, always hungry for that. Also, really keen, if you want to just chat about how people's ways of working are evolving and shifting and changing, and how do you think that's going to turn out and how you see your goals for your team changing. I would love to talk about that. Please get in touch.

Lenny (01:20:37):
Awesome. Megan, thank you so much for being here.

Megan Cook (01:20:40):
Thank you, Lenny. It's been fun.

Lenny (01:20:42):

# She turned 100+ rejections into a $42B company | Melanie Perkins

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
There's a very famous story about Canva. Early on, you pitched over a hundred investors and over a hundred investors said no to you.

Melanie Perkins (00:00:06):
It was really clear in my mind that it was the future and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback. Often in the form of rejection, they would say, "Oh, your market's not big enough," and I would say, "It's going to be huge." And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market I believe was, and then they'd say, "You're the same as some of other company." And I would say, "Hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
One of your values, Crazy Big Goals. I love that as a value.

Melanie Perkins (00:00:35):
The thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. You want to work really hard to will it into existence. I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want Right now? I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, there's a deck like this for every project you kick off. There's this big vision deck.

Melanie Perkins (00:00:59):
So we have this concept of chaos to clarity. Every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. That very first step at the far end of chaos was quite an embarrassing step actually, because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:14):
A lot of people think of Canva as like design graphics for social media and marketing and things like that, but you also have spreadsheets, whiteboards, charts, AI coding tool.

Melanie Perkins (00:01:24):
Was funny, looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:30):
Today my guest is Melanie Perkins, CEO and co-founder of Canva. Melanie is on track to be the most successful female tech founder in history and one of the most successful founders, period. Canva is currently valued at over $42 billion, making over $3.3 billion in revenue a year. They've been profitable for eight years straight and are one of the hottest private tech companies in the world right now. But it wasn't always this way. Melanie was rejected by over 100 investors when she was trying to raise her first round. Their team spent two years rewriting their entire code base and were unable to ship any new features for over two years, something they expected to just take six months, and they even went through a big pivot early on from a yearbook publishing platform to the Canva that you know today, Melanie does not do a lot of podcasts. She shares stories that I've never heard before and lessons that I'm still thinking about.

(00:02:21):

Melanie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Melanie Perkins (00:04:53):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
I'm even more excited. It's such an honor to have you here. I am such a fan of yours. I'm such a fan of the company that you've built. Also just everyone I meet from Canva is just so nice and so awesome and so smart, and so clearly you've built something really special. I'm really excited to use this hour to learn as much as I can from you about how you did that. We were actually chatting ahead of this about what would make the best use of this hour. I asked you what you believe has been the biggest factor in the success of Canva. You described something called building a Column B company and Column B thinking, I've never heard of this before, so let us start there. What is building Column B company, what does that mean?

Melanie Perkins (00:05:35):
Really great place to start. So I guess there's two ways of planning. The way that you can plan is you can dream of what is the perfect vision of the future, what future do you want to exist in, what would you like the world to look like? What would you like companies to look like? And then going from there, which is completely improbable, a completely crazy big dream, and then working hard to turn that into reality. And the alternate is, so just imagine you are building a castle on the hill and you're like, "What would be the most magical, wonderful, mythical experience?" And the other thing you can do is you can look at the bricks around you and you can say, "What can I do with these bricks? How high can I stack them? What can I do?" And I think most planning is often done by looking at the bricks and trying to stack them, and then you can create only so much. And so I guess the column B thinking is thinking about what is that magical wonderful future that you then want to invest years and decades of your life actually building? And so that's column A and column B in a nutshell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:37):
So column A is the traditional just work from today's world. Column B is work from this dream reality and work backwards from how to achieve that.

Melanie Perkins (00:06:44):
Exactly that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:45):
This is exactly the way actually Brian Chesky thought. I worked at Airbnb for a long time and it was always just, "Think about the world, the dream and then work backwards from that," so there's a lot clearly also worked out. So clearly this is an important lesson in the example of Canva, just what would've been column A for what Canva could have been and how did you think about the column B approach of what Canva in a dreamland could be?

Melanie Perkins (00:07:07):
So column A would've been nothing frankly, because the reality was when I was a university student with no company and no business or product or software experience, the reality would've been not very much. And so it was all column B, it was all thinking about the wild future that we wanted to create. Imagine what would be publishing in the future, what would communications look like in the future? And it seemed really impossible that it would stay on the desktop, it would stay really complicated. And it just seemed so apparent to me that in the future it was going to be completely different. Could I build that future? I had absolutely no idea, but the idea, it seemed completely likely, completely improbable that it wouldn't be the case that in the future, design would be online and collaborative and really simple. And so starting from that, we then took that concept and applied it to the school yearbook market in Australia with our first company Fusion Books. And then we applied it to Canva where we wanted to take it much, much bigger.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):
Let's talk about just how to actually go about building a Column B company. Say a founder is listening to this and they're just like, "Okay, I want to do this." What do they do? What are the steps? Where do you start?

Melanie Perkins (00:08:17):
I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want? What is the world that you want to live in? What is the future of transportation? What is the future of healthcare? What is the future that you want to live in and exist in? And for example, right now I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050. And so it's not necessarily that you can bring that into existence or you can will that into existence, but just to start to get clearer on what you would like that world to be like. Would you like it to be more inclusive? Would you like it? For me, one of the things I desperately want is everyone on this planet to have their basic human needs met.

(00:08:56):
What are those things that you believe are so important that you would love to see exist in that future? And I think an exercise we often do is what is wild success for X, or what is wild success for Y? And then equally, what is terrible failure for those things? And you can apply that just to abstract thinking in different industries. You can do that, apply that. We do that for the whole company for different areas of the company. And I think just taking that very long timescale of 10 years and getting a really crisp idea of what you want, of what you don't want, that's sort of the first step. And I think a lot of people don't spend quite enough time imagining that. And then the next part is you don't want to just have this crazy big dream and then do nothing about turning it into reality.

(00:09:43):
You kind of want to have a ladder that goes all the way up to the moon, which is your crazy, wild vision. And then you want to have rungs that just work its way up step by step. And so you want to get that really clear picture of the future that you would like and then just take little step, after little step, after little step. And it doesn't matter how small that first step is or how seemingly inconsequential if it is working towards that future that you want to will into existence, then you'll keep on climbing up that ladder in the right direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):
I think a lot of people hearing this might feel like, "I do this. Yeah, I have a vision. I know where I'm going. I have this big idea." What do you think they might be missing about just what this actually means and why they're probably not thinking big enough, they're not making the time to think this.

Melanie Perkins (00:10:23):
I think it is easy to be discouraged by the two, because they're completely two complete odds. They're completely different ends of the spectrum. So one is dreaming about the future, not that you think you can will into existence, it's just the future that you want. And then the next part is taking the tiny step that might be extremely microscopic and it feels a little embarrassing to be like, "I want a future that is," whatever it might be. And then to take such a microscopic step because I think you often have the future in one side or don't spend much time thinking about that. You're just thinking about the bricks before you. And so I think it's also naturally we all get distracted by day-to-day. It's your email, your Slack, the things that are kind of in your face, the reality that lives around you every day that kind of pulls you into this moment right now.

(00:11:14):
And so I think actually just making time to spend thinking about that is probably one of the most critical pieces. Just literally dreaming what is wild success in 10 years, what is terrible failure in 10 years is a really great place to start, is just spending some time there. And then even if that is so big and so vast and so wild, having that very first step is so important because then you take that little tiny first step and then the next step then that compounds for us, it's been compounding over a decade as we continue to work towards that same mission and vision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:49):
I want to hear how you operationalize this. I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, that there's a deck like this for every project you kick off. There's this big vision deck. Talk about what that looks like, because I think that's where people are like, "Okay, how do I actually do this?" Talk about that deck.

Melanie Perkins (00:12:04):
So we have this concept of chaos to clarity and every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. And so chaos can be an idea, it can be a problem, it can be a philosophy or a belief. And I've got a joke that I find funny. I'm not sure if you will, but how do you go from chaos to clarity? You add clarity. And so the idea is that each little step from chaos to clarity is the very first step might be literally writing it down. So rather than it being in your head, you've written it down, then the next step might be starting to create a pitch deck on it. And the next step might be starting to refine that, turning it into some designs, turning into a prototype. And then as it kind of goes from chaos to clarity, it starts to become more and more real and more and more people can see it. And so just taking those little incremental steps that adds clarity with every single step, then starts to help will it into existence rather than it being something that's completely amorphous and just stays in your head. So I think that's why visual communication for us is so important, is because otherwise, if it's just in your head, no one else can see it and you can't will it into existence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:13):
This makes me think about this concept of an ugly baby from the book, Creativity Inc., by I think Ed Catmull where he talks about how new ideas or this ugly baby that nobody wants to look at and deal with that I think he says they want to kill. I don't know why you would do that with an ugly baby. But there are these very soft, fragile things and it's really important to not kill them early and give them a chance to survive. And it's kind what I'm hearing here is have this big vision that many people are be like, "No, wait. This is completely absurd." And I love this idea of, "Okay, but here's one step we could take there to see if this could be a thing."

Melanie Perkins (00:13:48):
Yeah, I completely agree. And I think that's the thing is that that very first step at the very far end of chaos, it's very embarrassing because you're like, "I have this idea that is so big and so wild and how the hell would I do that? I have no idea." And so it's quite a embarrassing step, actually, because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers. In fact, you have likely none of the answers, but you just have the idea that you think would be cool. And ideally you get the idea that it would be so cool that you want to work really hard to will that into existence. And so I think one of the really key parts is not only just having the idea but thinking it's so cool that you're going to work for years to will it into existence. Actually Melissa did a really amazing pitch deck recently about the vision of, I won't go into the details right here, but the vision of her space and I was really excited about it. And so I think that that's the great thing about a pitch deck, is that other people can see your thinking and your thinking actually gets clarified as well as you go through that process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
I talked to Melissa, I talked to a bunch of other people that work at Canva, that have worked at Canva, and something else I heard along these lines is this phrase, Crazy Big Goals, which I think is one of your values. Crazy Big Goals. I love that as a value. Why is that so important? How does that fit into this? And just talk about the power of having Crazy Big Goals.

Melanie Perkins (00:15:08):
Yeah, so right from the start of Canva, it was truly a crazy-big goal. We're like, "We want to empower the world of design and take all these things that are super complicated and put them into one platform and make it accessible to the whole world. And we want to, rather than it be super expensive and unaffordable, we want to empower everyone everywhere in the world to design." So I mean, that was the epitome of a crazy big goal. And if we macro out even further, we've got this two-step plan, build one of the world's most valuable companies and do the most good we can do. So again, a rather crazy big goal. And I think the thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. Another crazy big goal. We'd love to see everyone's basic human needs met on the planet. Completely crazy big, that truly shouldn't be. It's kind of absolutely absurd that that's the case, but we can go into that later.

(00:16:02):
But I think with a crazy big goal, then you want to work really hard to will it into existence. And so if you start with a reasonable goal or a realistic goal, then you kind of get to it and you're like, "Oh cool, whatever." Or more importantly, if something happens, all the problems and roadblocks come along as they always do, then you're like, "Okay, I won't bother with that." And then you can just go and choose another course. And so a crazy big goal is both crazy big, but it's also something that you think is incredibly important that you actually want to will into existence because it is so much work to will a crazy big goal into existence. So it better be one that you want to actually achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:45):
Is there a crazy big goal that you set that comes to mind maybe as a good example of, "This is what I'm talking about?" Maybe a product you launched or feature back in the day?

Melanie Perkins (00:16:53):
Yeah, I mean so many things. So we have our mission to empower the world to design and we break it down into mission pillars. So empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, obviously a mouthful. But then what we do is we take successive goals every year towards this mission. And so for designing anything, we started off with social media and presentations and docs and websites and whiteboards and video. And so every year we're just launching more and more things to fulfill that part of the mission of empowering everyone to design anything. And then equally in every language we started in English and then it was Spanish and then it was 20 languages and then a hundred languages and then hard languages like Arabic and Hebrew and Urdu and right to left languages. And now we're in a hundred plus languages now and now we're really doubling down on the localization experience to make it feel truly local in every market around the world.

(00:17:47):
And so you can see how having these very big, audacious goals that you then just take a step after step towards helps then will it into existence or on every device. We started off obviously just with a web platform and then we launched our iPad app and then iPhone and then Android and then we spent years investing in cross-platform. So we have the same feature set across every device. And so you can see how these big amorphous things that seem very outlandish, you can then just will into existence after continual investment for a decade and it compounds over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:20):
I see how all this is starting to fade together. There's this big crazy ambitious vision and below there are the mission pillars that are feeding into this vision and then the Crazy Big Goals within each of those mission pillars to measure your progress towards all these components of the mission.

Melanie Perkins (00:18:32):
Exactly, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:34):
Okay, so with all that in mind, there's also this kind of trade-off you have to make of just how ambitious you get because oftentimes sometimes maybe you never miss the goal, but many times people miss these very ambitious goals. How do you just find that balance between ambitious crazy but doable enough where people don't get discouraged?

Melanie Perkins (00:18:51):
I think with a crazy big goal, the thing we have been really great at is achieving them. The timeframe that we achieve them on has not always been very reliable. We have certainly not been able to have pin dart. What's it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:07):
Bullseye?

Melanie Perkins (00:19:08):
We have not been very accurate with timing, but it's really interesting. I look back at a 2021 vision deck that we made obviously in 2021, but it was about 2026 and it was fascinating to see how much we'd actually been able to achieve from that vision deck and how many things were currently still in flight. And so by having that, I thought in 2021, some of those things may have happened a little quicker, but over the last five years they've really been coming into reality. And so we might think things are going to take six months and they take a year. We might think things are going to take six months and they take two years. This has been the case. We might think something's actually going to take our entire lifetime as some of those really truly Crazy Big Goals. And in fact, I don't even know if we can ever achieve them frankly. But they're such an important goal that even if you make a little step in their direction, they're worthwhile nonetheless.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
Whether you like him or not, Elon, this is similar to his, if you watch him, he sets these really ambitious goals and then often is far late on achieving them, but clearly it has worked out in achieving the crazy things that he's achieved. Something else I hear is you celebrate these goals in a really unique way. Talk about that.

Melanie Perkins (00:20:18):
So when we have these Crazy Big Goals, we also have couple them with really fun celebrations. And so we attempt to make the Crazy Big Goals happen in a moment in time. So then when we achieve them, we actually have a really fun moment because if you're just trying to plod towards the top of the mountain always and you never take a little moment to pat yourself on the back, it would feel a little arduous. And so over the years we had all sorts of fun little celebrations where we have smashed great plates and released doves and had a La Tomatina festival.

(00:20:51):
All sorts of fun things just to take a moment with the team to celebrate that huge achievement. And so I think that you want to celebrate what you want to really focus on and what you want everyone to take that moment. So when you achieve that crazy big goal when we launch in Spanish, when we hit a hundred languages and then the so forth across the company, taking that moment to actually pat yourself on the back and pat the teams on the back and say, "Hey, we did this thing. That thing that seemed really hard, we've now achieved." And the mission is often each of the different mission pillars, they're obviously a long area of investment that's going to take a long time to get to, but being able to celebrate each of the rungs on that on the way there I think is extraordinarily important. And then everyone works extraordinarily hard to bring them to life and then it gives everyone a little moment to feel proud of themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:43):
It'd be very motivating to get to just break a bunch of plates. I really like that. Celebration strategy.

Melanie Perkins (00:21:47):
We need to bring that one back. We haven't done that one in a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
That's a good one. I just love how concrete you're making this. So it's set these Crazy Big Goals, confine the component of the goals, set numbers there and then figure out the kind of steps you take to achieve these things. All fail is very easy. On the flip side of that, this is a segue. People hear these stories, they hear your story, they see Canva over the years and it's just this up into the right huge success story, one of the most successful companies in history. I imagine there have been many periods where things weren't going so great and when maybe things didn't look like they would work out. So let me just ask you this over the course of building Canva, once it started to click and started to feel like it was going to be a thing, was there a point where it started to again feel like, "Wow, maybe this may not work out. Maybe there's a huge setback that we may not get over?"

Melanie Perkins (00:22:35):
I think it's just a constant evolution. Every time the company doubles in size, pretty much all your systems break, all the things that were working don't work. A little example, in the early days we'd stand up and everyone would present their goals, what they're working on every day, every week. And then it kind of moved every month and then it was just taking too long because we've got so many people. And then it was sort of like we'd started doing these things called season openers and season openers were really fun where we got the entire company together, we talked about the goals that we'd achieved. And it was so funny because ahead of season openers, everyone would launch everything because they wanted to do it ahead of the season opener. And then we'd also set the goals for the coming cycle for the coming season at that point in time.

(00:23:17):
But then they started to become six hours long because we had so many people and so many teams. And so trying to find that right with the same philosophies of deep context for everyone with the same philosophies of the celebrations and the goals and trying to find that right flavor at every stage of scale is definitely hard. And so I think it's just a constant work in progress. Or back to your earlier point about timing of things, we were doing a front-end rewrite and we thought it would take about six months. It was really important because it was critical for cross-platform. It was critical for right to left. It was critical because we could only have five people working in our editor at any point in time because of the way the code base was structured and we thought it was going to take six months and then it took two years and it was two years of not shipping any product, two years of a product company not being able to ship product.

(00:24:14):
And that is such a core motivation for our team. He's shipping something, seeing great customer feedback and that kind of makes everyone feel happy and you've got momentum and it just felt like we're in a dark, dark tunnel that we could hardly see the end of the tunnel. And we didn't really know how long it was going to take because it just had to take as long as the tunnel was going to take. And it was a very hard time because other people would be launching this and that. And it was eventually we got out of that tunnel and it was extremely important that we did that work. We've now got two and a half thousand engineers and we're able to deliver amazing things that would've just been completely infeasible and simultaneous collaboration, so many things were baked into this. But yeah, it was not a fun period of time. A product company not shipping product is not really a recipe for fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:15):
For two years.

Melanie Perkins (00:25:16):
For two years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:17):
I feel like every builder listening to this knows exactly what you've been through and maybe not on that scale in those stakes, but you start on something, "Oh yeah, it'll take a few weeks," and then a year later you're still working on it.

Melanie Perkins (00:25:27):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
Just was the mood really, I don't know, sad internally? Two years, that's a long time not to ship anything. Just what was it like internally during that period?

Melanie Perkins (00:25:39):
I think it was kind of everything internally. We made it into a bit of a game. We had this game board and I bought these little rubber ducky sort of bath toys and we had, so we all the little components represented as a bath toy on this board and there was all these stages of went launched in product. There was an emergency lane at the end of it was home and hosed. And we did these weekly stand ups where everyone would come in and talk where their bath toy was at and just, we tried to make it fun for the team. So it was partly fun and it was partly distressing as all of our investors were like, "Hey, that thing." So I think it was both things at the same time. It was bonding let's say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:30):
Okay. Speaking of investors, speaking of other hard times, there's a very famous story about Canva. Early on you pitched over a hundred investors and over a hundred investors said no to you when you were just starting Canva. I think that's important. The investors than any founder I've talked to actually tries to pitch. It's impressive you tried that hard and went for so many pitches and finally got someone to take a bet. Now you are something like a $40 billion company making 3.3 billion ARR. I think there's something like $240 million monthly active users, one of the hottest private companies in the world. Just how does this feel?

Melanie Perkins (00:27:06):
I don't know. It was really clear in my mind that it was the future and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback often in the form of rejection. So they would say, "Oh, your market's not big enough." And I would say, "It's going to be huge." And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market I believe was. And then they'd say, "You're the same as some other company," coupled with rejection, and I would say, "Hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill." Or most investors just knew absolutely nothing about design or the industry that we're in. And so we then ended up with the first few slides saying, "Here's the lay of the land today. Here's the problem that we're going to solve."

(00:27:53):
And so while it was extraordinarily frustrating, their feedback made us stronger and made our pitch deck stronger. And it was sort of from that chaos to clarity. At the start it was this idea and then through the copious amounts of rejection, the pitch deck got stronger and more refined. So then when people, the first time I remember I spoke to someone for hours and they eventually got it. They were really committed to understanding what we were trying to do, but then not everyone has six hours to understand a concept. And so being able to take all the gems of wisdom from that conversation and have that understood really clearly in a really short period of time and have all of the reasons that people were rejecting us pre-answered in that initial pitch deck was really important. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why when I look back at our 2012 pitch deck, it's so valid and really still captures what we're doing today. And so I think that rejection in some ways makes you stronger if you can persist through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
Well, I think beyond that, I've never heard this part of the story. It's not just persisting, it's actually iterating and taking feedback that you're hearing to continue to evolve the pitch to a place where, "Okay, I finally get what you're doing." That is such a cool part of the story. How much of that vision and product changed throughout that journey versus just the way you pitched it and convinced people?

Melanie Perkins (00:29:10):
It was pretty consistent, but the way we articulated it changed greatly. And so for example, I wouldn't, in the early days, articulate the problem very much. And I went into, "Here's the cool solution." And so then the first few pages became very much more problem-based because if people don't understand the problem then they can't understand or care about your solution. And so there was a lot of refinement on the way it was articulated, but the actual vision itself I think was pretty consistent through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):
Guessing a lot of founders ask for your advice on raising money, getting started, having gone through so much rejection early on. What's your general advice to folks that are having a hard time fundraising?

Melanie Perkins (00:29:48):
I mean, I can only go on my experience, but I think it's sort of the dark tunnel analogy. Or chaos to clarity, let's go with that one. It's a slightly friendlier analogy and I think just taking the rejection and turning into things that you can control. So I can control my pitch deck, I can control the number of people I'm speaking to and I just spoke to literally everyone. And I think that continuing to use it to refine it rather than taking it as a personal rejection, I think it's really important to think how can I improve? How can I help someone to understand it? Some people are never going to understand it. I remember pitching an investor that had the lean startup book behind them when I was pitching them and they were never going to like Canva. We were not the lean startup. That was not the way that we were approaching it whatsoever. So there's some people that are just going to never like you and that's okay. I think it's important to find some people that do what you're trying to say and trying to do and kind of finding your tribe, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:47):
As an investor, this is really interesting to hear because it tells you there are companies like Canva there that everyone's turning down, a hundred investors passed on, that you might still be able to invest in.

(00:30:58):
Talking about your growth as a leader, say if you compare Melanie of today to Melanie of, I don't know, 12, 13 years ago when you were just starting Canva, what would you say is most different in terms of leadership?

Melanie Perkins (00:31:11):
I don't really know. Probably if you ask other people around me, they'd probably be more observant. But it is funny because there's some things that I think that I need to change and then I realize you go into it the same as some other company. And sometimes we even try that for a while and then we try that out and we're like... It didn't really work for us. And it's kind of building a house that you want every brick in the house to match. And if you go and try and take some bricks from someone else's house and stick it in your house, it's probably going to not look very matched. And so trying to find things that are authentic to us and are authentic to everything that's come before it, is just that constant, constant thing. And then each scale of each stage of scale of the company rather than going, taking someone else's bricks and trying to stick that in your house, trying to build the thing that's authentic.

(00:31:59):
So I think there's many things that are the same, but obviously the stage and scale and we're constantly having to give away hats. And so you kind of think about it in the very early days. We just a few of us, two of us in Fusion and then three of us in a little tiny group, and you kind of wear a hundred hats and then you have to be able to give away those hats to other people that can then do that way better than yourself. And so I'm sure there's been a few skills I guess I would've had to have developed over the last decade to be able to give away those hats. But yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we've had to do and double down on that was more authentic to the way we did it in the early days actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:37):
I love that story. I think again, if anyone working at a company that has gone through a lot of growth has experienced that when people from other companies come in and, "Here's how we did it at this company." Is there an example of some there that just like, "Here's something that this company brought in and people from this company thought we should do and we try it and didn't work?"

Melanie Perkins (00:32:54):
I won't go into specific examples, but so many times over. And I think that, I mean maybe that's probably, in answer your other question, we did things our way because that was the only way we knew. And there was many, many times over the years that we didn't have confidence in the way we were doing things and we were like, "Oh, they've done it from a big company that's bigger than our company. Let's go do that." And that hasn't always worked out so well for us. And so yeah, I think confidence in how we take what is authentic to us and do it at the next level of scale is a constant work in progress. It feels like, as I was saying before, systems break and need to be reinvented but also reimagined for that next layer of scale rather than going to try to get something off the shelf from another company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
I imagine it also helped that you were in Australia away from the Bay Area and where all these other big companies are at, just being able to do it your own way.

Melanie Perkins (00:33:48):
Yeah, very much so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):
Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter? I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in the roles. JustWorks knows that your employees are more than just your employees, they're your people. My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal, West Africa and San Francisco. My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people internationally to pay people on time and in their local currencies and to answer their HR questions 24/7. But with JustWorks, it's super easy whether you're setting up your own automated payroll, offering premium benefits or hiring internationally. JustWorks offer simple software and 24 7 human support from small business experts for you and your people. They do your human resources so that you can do right by your people, JustWorks, for your people.

(00:34:38):
Is there anything else that is a good example of how you did something pretty different from how other companies operate? Anything else that comes to mind as a fun example?

Melanie Perkins (00:34:48):
The goal driven structure, I think the things that we were talking about before. So the mission, actually breaking that down into the mission pillars, breaking those mission pillars down into the goals that we're then pursuing and then celebrating those goals when we do achieve them, I think is a deeply underloved way of building a company. Often people have a mission that's kind of on the wall somewhere and then what they're actually doing and the way they actually make money and the way people actually spend their time is in a very, very different direction from that original mission. And I think the magic is when you can bring those two things together and so you can have your mission, you can have your mission pillars that actually are helping to achieve that. And I think there's a real authenticity in that for customers as well, is that you are actually doing the thing that you promised you do, and it all ladders up together. It's certainly not an easy way to run a company, but I think that when you do get that formula, I think that there's a lot of authenticity with what you're saying you're doing, you're actually doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):
I want to come back to that. That's a whole really cool process. Do you have with closing the loop with customers, but something else I want to talk about while we're in this topic of growth over time. I saw you post something about how you had to realize they had to slow down and not just work, work, work like crazy. Talk about just that realization and why that ended up being so valuable.

Melanie Perkins (00:36:06):
So in the early days, I would just work seven days a week round the clock. In our very first company, we actually had printing presses because we were printing the yearbooks in my mom's house and then delivering them to schools around Australia. And in the early days of Canva, we certainly were working all weekend, all hours of the day. It was just constant. But when you've been doing this for a while, if you just keep working at that pace, I don't think it's good for anyone's health, mental health or anything else. So I think finding ways to continue, I still work extraordinarily hard, but to continue to have that balance in my day to day where I actually go to sleep, I find time to do things like going for walks or doing yoga, journaling I find extraordinarily helpful to make sure that I can always bring my best to everything that I'm doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:00):
It's easy to say that kind of stuff. It must be really hard to actually make time for that thing. Is there anything for those sorts of things, is there anything that you do that allows you to actually protect that time to actually do these things? Because as you said, there's a billion things that are just looking for your attention constantly.

Melanie Perkins (00:37:15):
I feel like I've developed some healthy habits over the years. I don't have emails on my phone and so when I shut my laptop, I actually tune out and then if there's a real issue, I'll get an emergency call or page. But I think trying to delineate I think is really important. So when I'm working, I'm all in and then when I'm not working, I'm all out. And actually giving that mental space I think is really important. I've spoken to a lot of founders that haven't quite found that and then do struggle with it. So when they're working every weekend it feels like the right thing, but then sometimes you can miss the forest from the trees when you're just working harder and harder, but maybe you're actually working on the wrong thing. And so I think being able to step away a little just to be able to get perspective is actually really beneficial.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):
I want to come back to this closing the loop process. Let's say that you have where you figure out what to build. A lot of your ideas come actually from the community. Talk about just that process and how many of your ideas actually came from your community.

Melanie Perkins (00:38:17):
Oh, it's one of my favorite things. We've been doing it for years now, and so we get more than a million requests from our community every year and we've got a whole incredible team that then tallies them, breaks them down, and then delivers them to all of our product teams and then those actually get closed. So this year we've closed more than 200 loops, but we know that each one of those things is going to be loved and needed by so many more people that don't bother to actually fill out the request form. So many things from gradient text, like little things like gradient text to really big things like our Sheets product. There's just been countless products. In the early days with our AI products, we didn't release them to teachers because we knew there was a lot of hesitancy for teachers using AI in the classroom.

(00:39:03):
And we got so many requests from teachers saying, "Can I please use this MagicWrite in the classroom?" And so with them we unlocked that and put on safety controls for teachers. And so it's just constant, actually. It's just part of our product process. I think there's two parts to product. One is building the future and towards the mission and the mission pillars as I was saying before. And the other is actually listening to our community and building what they want. And so I think that that's the two core pieces of product in my mind. And the closing the loop comes in so many different forms. There's the explicit asks, and then the other thing that we double down on all the time is user testing and watching people use it. And if people hesitate clicking a button or people don't quite understand how something works, it's amazing to me how you can find 10 random people on the internet and they can give such astute feedback that then is so representative for such a large number of people. I've personally run hundreds if not thousands of user tests myself and it's been deeply embedded in our product teams also.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
Wow, that must be really stressful for someone looking at a test of Canva, trying to try something when you're in the room.

Melanie Perkins (00:40:08):
It's actually, we do it all online actually. I mean the ones I've run are typically online. So people are so much more frank I think when it's just them and their camera and they don't really... Yeah, they tell you really how it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:24):
Is there a tool or a kind of a process there that you find really helpful? I don't know if you want to name names of products or anything like that, but it's something that you find helpful or useful.

Melanie Perkins (00:40:31):
Yeah, we use a lot of UserTesting.com, find that super valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):
All right, go user testing. Okay. Something else that I know is really important to you and also really unique to Canva is something that's called the two-step plan. You mentioned this earlier, I want to definitely talk about this. What is the two-step plan? Why is this so important to you?

Melanie Perkins (00:40:50):
Yeah, so when you were asking about Crazy Big Goals, I think this is our most macro, most crazy biggest goal. Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies and step two, do the most good we can do. And in our early days I thought I'd do step one and then step two and realize that actually step one can fuel step two and step two can fuel step one. And so that's been a really big part of Canva for some years now. In the early days we took the 1% pledge, which I think is an incredible program. Every single person, every single company should take that where you give 1% of time, money, equity and profitability. And I think that's a really easy thing to do in the early days that then can compound greatly over time. We also knew that Canva's equity was obviously going to be a really key part of it.

(00:41:35):
So Cliff and I owned a little over 30% of Canva, and so we decided we were going to take 30% of Canva and use it to do the most good we can do. And we are doing that. So we're doing all of our donating through the Canva Foundation. We've just, over the last few years, we've donated $50 million to GiveDirectly, where they give money directly to people in Malawi who are in extreme poverty and then they can use that money on their family to go to school, to get healthcare, to start small businesses, to get a roof so they can sleep in without being wet. Just real truly basic human needs things. And we've just announced that we're going to be giving another a hundred million dollars over the next four years to people in extreme poverty. And it's just like when you go and sit with people and you hear about how they're spending, what's very microscopic amount at $550 doesn't buy us that much, but it's a life-changing amount of money for people in extreme poverty and it's truly transformational what it can do.

(00:42:39):
And you meet people and you hear their stories and it's truly the best money I could ever imagine spending. And that crazy big dream I was mentioning earlier of everyone having basic human needs met, it's so completely insane that isn't the case today. There's no specific reason why people don't have their basic human needs met on our planet, but we just haven't got to act together as humanity. And so that is a truly crazy, big dream. But back to the two-step plan. Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies and step two do the most good we can do. And finding ways to do that at the same time I think is extraordinarily important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:17):
That's incredible. It makes me think about, not to mention Elon again, but Elon's three-step strategy plan and it's like build better cars versus this is like, "Okay, solve all the problems of the world and make the world a better place." What a better master plan to compare. Something else about this that I love is a lot of companies have this, have something philanthropic going on with the company and it's like sitting in a doc on some page. It's part of their mission. It's not actually that big of a deal to them. What I hear from folks at Canva is something you talk about all the time. This is an actually core part of how you work and think and how you set goals and set vision and missions.

Melanie Perkins (00:43:53):
Yeah, I'm happy to hear that. I wouldn't do Canva if it wasn't going to have a positive impact on the world. For me, getting really rich is not a goal unto itself whatsoever. It's a means to an end and I've been very blessed to be able to do some work and that creates wealth that can then go and have people's basic human needs met. But they're working just as hard, but they don't have the opportunity. And even our education product, it's now used by a hundred million people each month and we are in most school districts and rolled out across countries and being able to bring quality education tools to every, and we give that away for free as well. Being able to help empower schools all around the world and we're going to be doubling down and doubling down into that product to bring quality education to all. I think it gives so much more meaning behind work. We've also, between our education product and our non-profit program where we also give away our paid product for free, we are giving away 1.5 billion of product a year now. And so the impact that that can have and the ripple effect of that I think is pretty great. And I think for all of us, it gives a lot more meaning to our work than, "Get Rich."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):
Okay. So speaking of product, coming back to that, you guys are launching something, maybe you've already launched it by the time this comes out, what I heard described as the biggest launching canvas history, no big deal, that's a high bar. Considering all the things you guys have launched, what are you launching? Why is it such a big deal?

Melanie Perkins (00:45:24):
We are extraordinarily excited about what we are launching. I guess the whole mission of Canva is to empower the world to design. And so what has been enabled by new technology with all of AI has been just really profound. Enabling people to take their idea and turn it into design a design and have as little friction between those two points. So we are doubling down radically on our video product and bring some incredible capabilities to our mobile and desktop platform. We are launching email, which has been one of our most hotly requested features from enterprise customers around the world and business customers around the world who want to be able to design with Canva's drag and drop ease and to be able to create an email. We are launching forms, we are launching, probably one of the most exciting things is the way we're embedding AI across the entire product suite.

(00:46:12):
And so you can actually use AI to design a presentation, a video, a email, a website. All of these things can actually now be done inside the core editor, inside the design tab, which is used by 170. It's used 170 million times a month. And then on our elements tab, which is used 900 million times a month, we are also embedding AI. So you can actually generate a video, you can generate a canvas code and you can generate photos all directly inside that platform. And then we're also launching comments as lots of our customers use Canvas to comment and collaborate. And now you can actually just tag at Canvas and you can collaborate. You can just say, "Hey, can you make this title shorter? Can you do this? Can you do that?" And it has all of the context of the design so in situ, you can actually just have a collaborator that can help get your work done. So we are pretty excited about all of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):
Amazing. Something I'm going to just let people know, I don't know if people know all this, how many products you all have now. I think a lot of people think of Canva as a design graphics for social media and marketing and things like that, but you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, code, AI coding tool. And now what I'm hearing is email forums. There's probably a few other things I'm not thinking [inaudible 00:47:36]-

Melanie Perkins (00:47:35):
Yeah, truly design anything. We're literally living up to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):
Oh my god, it's happening.

Melanie Perkins (00:47:38):
100 million people design a presentation in Canva each month now and it's pretty fascinating to see that when you speak to, I saw a tweet some time ago. They were talking about how it's a generational thing that a certain generation uses Microsoft, a certain generation uses Google. Gen Z, the way they design a presentation is in Canva, but it's not just generational for those with other generational ilk, but it is been fascinating to see that come to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:11):
The email product, is that like a email client product or It's a design emails that you can then send through your products?

Melanie Perkins (00:48:17):
It is design emails, so you can design email, then you can take that code and you can pop it into any email platform that you use.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:24):
How do you think about products you're going to expand to, I know there's trade secrets here. You don't want to tell everyone where you're going next, but just how do you approach, here's where we're going next.

Melanie Perkins (00:48:31):
So our mission, empower world design, empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and just take those things very literally. So to literally design anything, to literally publish anywhere. And so we now print in 50 something countries around the world and you can get it printed and delivered to your house. And we plant it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):
I actually did that, while you're on it.

Melanie Perkins (00:48:55):
Oh, awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:59):
I wasn't planning this, but I had a print thing delivered to my house. It's so cool.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:02):
Oh, yeah. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
We have to go to a print shop in this freaking graphic and well here's a button. Let's click that.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:07):
Exactly. Just click print and it pops up beautifully packaged to your door.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):
I don't know how that works. Yeah, I don't know how you did that, but it worked. How cool.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:14):
But it's very cool. And so yeah, I guess literally bring these things to life. Oh, we're like launching 3D as well. So all of these things we will be bringing to life literally. And just picking off what is the most strategically important next thing to enable everyone to design anything, to enable everyone to publish anywhere. And we have been doing that for a decade and we'll continue to do that forever more using the latest technology to truly bring people's ideas to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:40):
Okay, so this is helpful. So if someone's like, "Oh, will Canva come for my space?" Are people designing thing that was design and also, what was it? Publish?

Melanie Perkins (00:49:49):
Publishing anywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:50):
Okay. Publishing and designing. Okay. So if you're doing any designing or publishing, watch out.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:57):
From a macro perspective, there was creativity tools and productivity tools. And what Canva really does is we're literally smack bang in the middle of that Venn diagram of creativity and productivity, rather than making our customers have to make a choice between those two suites.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):
Something I wasn't planning on asking about, but I think it's on everyone's minds. There's always this Figma and Adobe and then there's Canva and there's kind of a bunch of places we could go with this. One is just at the beginning of the journey where a lot of founders try to figure out their wedge and their specific niche. Just how did you think about that? "Here's how we might have a chance to..." I know Figma wasn't even around back then, I don't think. Just how did you approach your early wedge of users?

Melanie Perkins (00:50:38):
One of the most important things that we did was we didn't really worry about competitors at all. We actually just saw where is there a gap in the market that we can uniquely fill, and what can we solve a problem, a core problem that people currently have today? And so with our first company that was yearbooks in Australia and there wasn't great tools and these yearbook coordinators got thrown in to have to design something and they'd have no design experience. And we spoke to every single customer. We gave them an over the phone tutorial, we understood all of their pain points, we got continuous customer feedback, and then we tried to iterate and improve.

(00:51:12):
And then when we were thinking about Canva, a few years into that, actually one of the schools said, "I love this product so much. Can I use it to design newsletters?" And they had all sorts of other things that they wanted to use it for, and we kind of looked around and were like, "Oh, there's still nothing on the market." This was a few years into it, that actually does the thing that we're doing, but for all these other things. And so it was much more like where is the gap in the market that people are currently having a pain point? And if you can solve that pain point really well and solve it in such a way that people actually want to pay for it because it is truly solving a real pain point that they have, I think that kind of sets it up for success rather than be a problem or a solution looking for a problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:53):
So what I'm hearing there is you didn't overthink, "Here's my CP, here's the wedge and the strategy of how we expand into this large thing." It's like, "Here's people with a problem that hasn't been solved in years that we keep seeing. Let's try to solve it."

Melanie Perkins (00:52:04):
Exactly that. And if you take that problem centered approach that helps people to achieve something they actually want to do in the real life, you're probably going to be at a reasonably good spot, especially if it maps to a larger market. That's a particularly great thing. If it only solves one person's problem, that might not be a great company going forward. But if a few people have that same problem... But I think that again, back to that big ladder and that first rung, I think it's better to solve a small number of people's problem really well than trying to solve a large number of people's problem. Not very well at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
Something I can't not ask about is just how you think about AI in your product. You mentioned how you integrated or all through the product, just you guys are doing really good stuff with AI. A lot of companies are struggling to find something really that works great. Do you have just a philosophy of, "Here's how we integrate AI into Canva," where it ends up being really helpful and people love it?

Melanie Perkins (00:52:56):
Your question is actually the answer at the same time. I think being able to integrate it into the product where it actually helps people to get their work done where it genuinely helps them to achieve their goals, and then being really open to listening to your community and hearing what they're loving, what they're struggling with and refining from there I think is really, really important. Just because AI is all the rage and investors really like AI doesn't necessarily mean it should be front and center, but if it can genuinely help your customers to achieve their goals. So the thing that I was mentioning before, enabling people to communicate their ideas and have little friction between those two points, AI is just kind of naturally a very critical part of that equation for us. In fact, it was funny looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing because it really was critical to what we were trying to do even in our 2012 deck. You can kind of imagine how AI very much fit into the equation because of exactly what we're trying to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
I'm going to keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. So here's the question: what's a way you've found in your personal life and work life to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might find useful?

Melanie Perkins (00:54:11):
So many things. So AI is often the first. If I'm having an idea, it'll be a first place that I go and explore the idea. And now with Canva, and you can just tag Canva, I can say, "Give me more ideas of this," and it's shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design. It's actually integrated deeply into your workflow. Another really fun thing I do is an AI walk and it's when I just put my ear pods in and then I go for a walk and I just say everything on my mind and I use that to then kind of filter out my thoughts and figure out what are the things I need to action. And it kind of helps again, get out of the weeds and think about things from a more macro perspective rather than from the things that might be in my Slack messages or in my email. It just gives you that sort of helpful vantage point I find. So yeah, so many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:01):
For the Voice Note tool, is there a tool that you find useful for that?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:04):
Yeah, I might use Apple Notes or directly into Canva Docs, and then I actually just do the brain dump into Canva Docs and then just summarize them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:16):
Got it. And so you just use native microphone-

Melanie Perkins (00:55:19):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:19):
... dictation sort of thing. Nothing fancy?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):
Okay.

Melanie Perkins (00:55:21):
Yeah, I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:23):
This reminded me of, you mentioned earlier in our conversation you had this vision board that you said is for 2050. Is that right?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:30):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):
Can you share something from that vision board?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:35):
I'll tell you why the vision board came about because it's only been in recent months. I did feel like as humanity, we are on a bit of a freight train and that freight training is, I think if we take a lot of visions for a lot of different companies and a lot of things that are happening and you just fast-forward 50 years or you do 2050 and you say, "Are we in a safer world? Is the world the place that we want our kids to grow up in? Is this the humanity that we want?" I didn't feel that the train that we are headed on always feels great. In fact, it scared me quite greatly for a whole host of reasons. And so I sat with that feeling for a little and then I kind of got to work on my 2050 walls and back to the chaos to clarity.

(00:56:22):
The first thing was riding my 2050 wall and I've really been loving, I've got a whole on the 2050 wall, started with a lot of quotes. Everything good was once imagined and many other quotes were along those similar lines. And then rather than just being fearful of the things that I'm worried about for society and for humanity, I started to think what would the alternative be? What is that vision that I would love to see us have basic human needs for all global education being a basic human right that everyone experiences all the really important things that we want as humanity. And again, using vision and using imagination and just dreaming about the future. And I find it really fascinating in my day-to-day by literally having it beside me as I work every day, the little tiny decisions that can kind of help to angle towards that future that we want and can I help will any of that into existence? I honestly don't know.

(00:57:24):
But I feel like just by starting to write it down some little brainstorm exercise with a number of other people and starting to just etch out, how do we get closer and closer to that. On my vision of the future, it's community. It's the whole of humanity trying to dream bigger and to dream bigger goals. And then us actually rising to that occasion in the world. We don't want, I think loneliness is rife, purpose is gone. What we teach people in schools is pointless. And in my vision for 2050, it's none of those things. Communities are bound to fall. We all have deep purpose. And that deep purpose springs from having bigger dreams that we collectively go out and achieve. Something that we're doing at our Canva world to a keynote in two weeks time, which I think is going to be after this is released, we've been asking people what is one goal you'd like to see the world achieved in our lifetime?

(00:58:25):
And then people literally writing it down I think is pretty powerful. And then people sharing that with other people I think is pretty powerful. And then us actually figuring out how the hell do we turn? That reality that we all deeply desperately want into existence, I think is genuinely one of the biggest questions of our time. But then again, rather than trying to tackle that entire thing by yourself, how do you take that first tiny step that starts to see that in your own life, in your own family, in your own community? And I think that's where we'll get purpose from and I think that is one of the key answers to loneliness is actually working towards something bigger than yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:02):
Wow. I really appreciate you sharing all that. I was thinking as you're talking, just considering how wildly successful Canva has been and just how ambitious that was when you started. I would not be at all surprised that this actually happens and that you achieve this very difficult vision.

Melanie Perkins (00:59:18):
It's not something that I alone can achieve. I think it has to be obviously a global collective effort because there's zero chance I can go and achieve basic human needs for all. But I think that I'd like to change that. I'd like to help change the mood. I'd like to help change the way we're thinking about things. I genuinely think we need to move course a little and decide not what are all the things that we... what's the freight train we're currently on, but what is it that we actually want? What do we want our societies to look like? What do we want the world to look like? Is it good enough that there's people, hundreds of millions of people that can't eat? What the hell? It just literally makes no sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:03):
A column B world, you might say.

Melanie Perkins (01:00:06):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:07):
Melanie, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?

Melanie Perkins (01:00:17):
You have been extremely extensive. I don't think I've got anything else to add, frankly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:20):
That's the goal. That's the goal. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Melanie, are you ready?

Melanie Perkins (01:00:25):
Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Melanie Perkins (01:00:31):
One of the books I love is The Power of Moments, and it talks, am I supposed to be really fast and not tell you about it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
It's all good.

Melanie Perkins (01:00:39):
Okay. Two books, the Power of Moments, and one of the books early on I read was Designing the Obvious, which I found very insightful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:48):
I like they shifted to fast mode. You don't have to go superfast. All good. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Not Canva.

Melanie Perkins (01:00:56):
I love the Calm app. It is my daily companion. I use it to meditate. I use it to listen to music. I just find it very calming.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:05):
Okay. First question. I usually ask about movies and TV shows. I hear you don't watch a lot because you're so busy and have so much going on. So I'm going to try it, new question I haven't asked before. I'm curious where this goes. So excluding Canva, what's a product you'd love to work on someday, whether it's like an existing other company like, "Oh, I wish I could work on that thing," or just a new product you'd love to build maybe after the Canva chapter.

Melanie Perkins (01:01:27):
I feel like my Canva chapter's going to go on for a long time, so I don't know, because we've got-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:27):
On the side, on the side.

Melanie Perkins (01:01:33):
... decent plans side and we're pretty extensive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):
Okay, maybe a company you'd love to fund. There we go.

Melanie Perkins (01:01:36):
I feel like there's a lot of opportunity to create global infrastructure that is truly empowering. And so as I look at my 2050 wall, I think there's a lot of things that are currently only exclusively available to a small number of people that should be available to everyone. And so the more that we can do to uplift the rising tide lifts all boats I think is a thing that's just so of such critical importance. And I think there is this weird belief that you can be fine and everyone else can be not fine and that's all cool. I don't think that's cool. I think everyone suffers in such a case. So I think more things that help everyone to rise.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):
Maybe along those lines, but maybe not, is there a life motto that you find yourself coming back to and work your own life?

Melanie Perkins (01:02:28):
There's a few. I love the quote, happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. I feel like that's a constant aspiration. And then I've just been so obsessed lately with the idea that everything is led by imagination. That imagination is the very first step of that creative process. So everything is good because once imagined is a quote you're going to be seeing from Canva all the time now because it is true that if you don't imagine it, you can't will it into existence. And in fact, everything great that we experience in life was first imagined.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:00):
Wow. There's so much power to that one thought nugget there is just, there's all these tools now that can make building so much easier. You can just build anything you want, just describe it. But so many people are just like, I'm in the same boat. I'm just stuck. "What do I want?" I don't even don't know what I need. What should I build? And that's exactly what you're talking about there. Okay. Last question. So I saw it somewhere that you were an aspiring figure skater in your early years in high school, you had to wake up at 4:30 A.M. to practice. Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building Canva?

Melanie Perkins (01:03:36):
So many things are quite directly applicable, falling down over and over again and getting up and trying again, the importance of hard work and determination. I think the falling down, it was quite literal in my figure skating in days, and maybe it was a little more metaphorical in today, but it is constant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:57):
You're right. I wonder what that metaphor is for figure skating. I don't know. Anyway, Melanie, this was incredible. I am so thankful that you agreed to do this. Two final questions: where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out, send you feedback on Canvas or join Canva, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Melanie Perkins (01:04:12):
Really great questions. So you can find me on LinkedIn. That's where I post the most. And you can go to and I can get the URL to give us your wishes and we want to hear them and we literally listen to them. It doesn't just go into a suggestion box. And then how can they be helpful? Use Canva, spread Canva, teach Canva. We're doing a Canva World Tour through October, which is probably going to be updated when this is posted.

(01:04:43):
Come to our events. We do events all around the world and we'd love to see you and to hear from you. And if you are in a company, starting a company, try and do the 1% pledge. Try and figure out your own version of the two-step plan and try and build products and in every decision that you make that actually makes the world that you want to live in. I think there's this kind of belief sometimes that the world is created by other people, but we all have a very active hand in creating the world that we live in. And every decision that you make for investors, every company that you fund, is that contributing the world to the world that you want to live in? Or is it creating the freight train that none of us want to be on?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:27):
I have to ask before I let you go. Are you going to have the rap dancers at the next Canva event?

Melanie Perkins (01:05:33):
You'll have to wait and see.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:34):
Okay. Melanie, thank you so much for being here.

Melanie Perkins (01:05:38):
Thank you so much, Lenny, for having me and your great well-researched questions.

# Everything you’ve ever wanted to know about SAFe and the product owner role | Melissa Perri

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
There's this whole concept of SAFe, basically Scaled Agile, right?

Melissa Perri (00:00:03):
Scaled Agile Framework came out of the desire to figure out how do we scale Scrum and different processes. I do not recommend using SAFe. Every single person I have talked to who likes SAFe, found success with SAFe, they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
You've been up close and personal with a lot of companies working with product owners, Scaled Agile, and all these things.

Melissa Perri (00:00:23):
This product owner role did not emerge from product management as we know it today. It was a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on. I ended up going to a ton of Agile conferences and speaking about product management, and I started to learn that there was this product owner role in Scrum.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
It feels like it's growing. More and more companies are adopting this as the way to work.

Melissa Perri (00:00:44):
A lot of large companies turn to Scrum or to the frameworks, and it's because they traditionally didn't grow up building software. When you look at agile methodologies, what we're really saying there is we want to be able to move quickly and deliver great value to customers. If you embrace those principles, you're going to do well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:05):
Today my guest is Melissa Perri. Melissa is a legend in the product management community. She's the author of the foundational book Escaping the Build Trap, and her most recent book Product Operations. She's also the CEO and founder of The Product Institute, which trains product managers at all levels. She's trained PMs at almost every Fortune 500 company at this point, and in our conversation we dive deep into a topic that I don't spend a lot of time on on this podcast, product owners, Scrum, Scaled Agile, and building product at very large non-tech companies.

(00:01:38):
Melissa shares the history behind these ways of working, what she's seen work and not work when companies roll out these frameworks, and most importantly what you can do as a leader at one of these companies and as a product owner working in one of these companies to level up your organization and yourself. I learned a ton from this conversation and I'm really curious to hear what you think since we don't cover this kind of stuff on this podcast too much. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Melissa Perri. Melissa, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Melissa Perri (00:02:19):
Thanks, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:21):
First, let me give a little context on this conversation that we're having. I think it's going to be a little bit unique. I was doing a deep dive on the job market in tech, and I saw something that was really surprising to me that the product owner role was the third-fastest growing role in tech, and this was just in the US, the data I was looking at, but I think it's probably true broadly. This was extremely surprising to me because I've never worked with a product owner, I don't hear anyone in my circles talking about product owners, I've never wanted to hire a product owner, and it feels like it's just this very different part of the tech ecosystem that you don't hear a lot about on podcasts like this, and it's clearly growing so I felt like it'd be really helpful to spend some time helping people and helping me understand this part of the world.

(00:03:08):
I asked you to come on to talk about this. You've been up close and personal with a lot of companies working with this way of working with product owners, Scaled Agile and all these things, so I couldn't think of a better person to have on here to help us understand what's happening here, and also just to help people do this better. Melissa, thank you again for coming on and helping us understand this.

Melissa Perri (00:03:28):
Yeah, I'm excited to talk about this. I have been really passionate about this topic for many years and I've been talking about it in both agile circles and product management circles, so pretty excited for the listeners to hear what else is going on out there.

(00:05:06):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long-time podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:13):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, [inaudible 00:05:22], and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:31):
Yes. We just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:53):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema, not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:06:05):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:24):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us, and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co, that's oneschema.co.

(00:06:39):
Before we get into the history, is there just anything broadly that you think might be helpful to share before we dive into the history of the product owner role and all these things?

Melissa Perri (00:06:46):
Maybe it'll help to set some context of where did I see all of this start emerging as well. When I started in tech, I was very much a product manager, never heard of the product owner role before in my life. In Escaping the Build Trap I talk a lot about how we used Scrum when I started working with this team in a startup, and it was the first time I ever heard of it. That was 2011. At the time, the person who was teaching me about agile was very like, "Hey, this is flexible. We're just going to break things into sprints. We're going to sit there and actually talk about the work. This is made for us to actually get better at our jobs." We were pretty sold on it and it was never dogmatic. As I worked at other companies, I found that they were being a little more dogmatic with their Scrum, with their stand-ups, how we actually run things.

(00:07:36):
Then I started speaking at conferences, and one of the first conferences I spoke at in New York City was called Lean UX, and there was a bunch of people from the agile world there too. I learned that this was much bigger than what we were learning in my company and what we were doing in these companies. There's this whole group of people out there practicing agile, and I was like, "Oh, this is cool. I want to learn how to do things better. Teach me about your philosophies." I ended up going to a ton of agile conferences and speaking about product management.

(00:08:04):
At the time, people were really excited to hear more about it, and I started to learn that there was this product owner role in Scrum where I was talking more about how we traditionally talk about product management, understand your customer, go out test things, make sure there's a hypothesis, don't just blindly build what you want to build. I found out that that was not the case in a lot of these companies who are adopting Scrum and introducing a product owner role, so I started doing a lot of trainings through my school product institute and I'd get called into these large companies, all these large banks, probably around 2014, 2015, to help them learn product management. I was really excited about this because before, they didn't want anything to do with it. They were like, "I don't know what product management is. I don't need this."

(00:08:47):
I go in to train people and I found that a lot of them had been going through an agile transformation and they had all of these new product owners where they came in and they basically said, "Hey, you're a product owner now. Your whole role has changed." They came from all different backgrounds. Some were developers, so a lot were business people who worked on the banking side, a lot were business analysts, some were project managers, but they just collectively took a bunch of people and said, "Tada, today you're going to be a product owner because we're going to do agile now." I will come in and help train these people.

(00:09:20):
What I found was that there was a really big misconception about what those people should be doing compared to what they teach in agile and Scrum versus what we all consider great product management. I've been trying to fill that gap for the last almost 10 years working with these companies here. Then I would go to their leaders and at the beginning of these agile transformations, I'd be like, "You can't just do Scrum. That's not going to make you amazing at delivering products. There's so much more to this." The leaders didn't quite understand that.

(00:09:51):
I'm noticing this really big shift in the industry where we're finally getting there. A lot of companies are doing it well now. Capital One is a great example that took their agile transformation and started adding product management on it, and they've really turned that around in the card business. So many organizations are still at the beginning of this journey and they're at the place where I saw people 10 years ago. I think there's still a lot of companies out there. Maybe we take it for granted in tech or in Silicon Valley about how many companies are doing this and how big this scope is where they're making these roles, but they're not really doing product management end to end. That's where I've seen all of these areas and I've been trying to help organizations for the last 10 years really set up robust product management practices. It's not just one piece of development, it's how do we actually build better products?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:42):
I love this example of Capital One. It can work really well and you can get to a place where it's actually really productive. There's a few ways we can go about this. Do you think it would be helpful to talk through the history of the product owner role just like where it initially emerged?

Melissa Perri (00:10:56):
Yeah, I think that's a great place to start. I think it brings a lot of context too to what's happening. People forget about the history here. When I explain it to people, I say we had product managers in Silicon Valley, right? They were in Google, they were in all of these companies, Amazon, and they were born out of this business role. From a software native company, your software is the business, right? It's what you sell, it's what you actually look at. Our product managers in Silicon Valley, they're doing market research, they're talking to customers, they're working with developers, they're iterating, they're doing the end-to-end product management.

(00:11:31):
What happened on the other side of things, especially in large companies, is the emergence of product management from Scrum, from product ownership. That's usually the first time these companies were introduced to product management was from implementing a product owner role and then going, "Hey, we're still not meeting our goals. Are we building the right thing?" Then they started thinking product management. Where that role came from is Scrum. If we go back and talk about the history of agile, agile was a movement that got started by software developers. In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was written. A bunch of developers got together in Park City, Utah, they were all skiing together and they said, "Hey, we've been independently all working on how to develop software better."

(00:12:18):
Some people were practicing Scrum as we know it today. That was Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland. There were people who were doing different types of agile frameworks as well, Kanban, where you were moving it through a Kanban board. There was behavioral-driven development, there was feature-driven development. That was the style of agile. There was XP, extreme programming, that was started by Ron Jeffries. All of these people found each other saying, "Hey, we've been trying to push the boundaries of how do we develop better software," and they got together and they wrote the Agile Manifesto as we know it today.

(00:12:51):
The Agile Manifesto is really just a guideline on how they're striving to not just be people who code what people want, but building better products. How do we build better products through software development? The premise to remember this is, and I keep saying it, but they're all software developers. Nobody was a product manager who went to that meeting. Nobody who wrote the Agile Manifesto was actually a product manager. I've spent a long time talking to these people as well over the past 10 years just saying, "Hey, how did this come about? Where did this come from?"

(00:13:23):
The one person who was really close to them who was a product manager was Jeff Patton, but he never signed the Agile Manifesto, he wasn't at that meeting. He talked to them a lot, he was able to see what was going on, but all of this was a purge from how do we build better products from a development perspective. That's really important to know. Two of the people who signed the Agile Manifesto, Jeff and Ken, as I was talking about, they were independently coming up with Scrum on their own in their different companies, and they got together and started to codify it and they said, "This is how I'm doing it, this is how I'm doing it." They ended up writing the Scrum Guide. The Scrum Guide is what a lot of people base their agile practices off of today. In the Scrum Guide, it outlines a bunch of roles that you would do on the development team, and then it says how you should be developing products.

(00:14:11):
Most people out there are working in Scrum today, and what they say is, "Let's break things down into two-week sprints." You can change the length of your sprint if you want to, but two-week sprints is pretty standard at the beginning. We define what we're going to work on in the backlog. It's the product owner's responsibility to define what goes into the backlog, write down the user stories for it, do all that. Then the development team comes in, they discuss it, the product owner prioritizes it, they ask questions, and then the development team commits to what they want to build and they go out and do it. At the end, the result is a potentially shippable product, not necessarily shippable, but potentially shippable.

(00:14:48):
They're trying to break it down into small chunks and build things instead of what they had been doing in a lot of companies, which was building stuff for three years and then releasing it in a big bang. What all of the people who signed the Agile Manifesto realized was if we do it the other way, if we do a waterfall type environment, agile waterfall, that's where we go across, there's a lot of risk because we don't test it with the customer and we don't get feedback on it if we spend three years building it and never show it to somebody. It really approached a different way of building software. It said let's chunk it down and try to get feedback faster. Really noble intention.

(00:15:24):
In the Scrum guide though, it introduces these new roles. We have developers as we know and love them, we also have a product owner, then we have a Scrum master, and the Scrum master is in charge in Scrum of actually helping people do Scrum better. That's literally their job. How do I do Scrum better? How do I make sure that the team is working well together? They host things like retrospectives where at the end of a sprint we say what went well, what didn't go well, how should we actually inspect and adapt our process. The product owner is where things get murky.

(00:15:57):
The product owner in general first showed up with Scrum, and if you go and you read the first Scrum guide, which I pulled up and started reading, because I've been very fascinated about how this is described, it says that the product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of work done, the team does the work. Interesting, because now the product owner is not quite part of the team. The team consists of developers with all the skills to turn the product owner's request into the potentially shippable increment each sprint. The team is usually seven plus or minus two members.

(00:16:29):
Then when you go further into the first version of the Scrum Guide, it does say that the Scrum master works with the customers and management to identify and instantiate a product owner. The Scrum master teaches the product owner how to do his or her job in order to optimize the value of the use of Scrum. If they don't, the Scrum master is held accountable. Then it's got another tip if we go deeper into this. It says per commercial development, the product owner may be the product manager. For in-house development efforts, the product owner could be the user department manager.

(00:17:01):
What's interesting is that that was the first version of the Scrum Guide, and I get into arguments about the Scrum Guide with people all the time. 2013's version though, the more updated one that you could go and find is the one that almost every company has run an agile transformation off of. It loses that thing that says the product manager could be the product owner. It doesn't say it anywhere in that guide. This was the first version, and you can kind of tell it was an aside. It's like, "Oh, by the way, the product owner in Scrum doesn't need to be a product manager, it could be the customer, it could be a developer." It's usually the customer.

(00:17:34):
When they were writing this too, sometimes the customer was an internal person at a bank or somewhere where we were building software who was asking for the software. They were like, "Go build me an internal tool. Go do this." Now we're just asking for requirements inside a company, and that's where you can start to see how the product owner role kind of evolved into somebody going to ask, "Hey, what do you want me to build? What's required here?," and then just listening to somebody come back and say, "I need this feature, I need this feature, I need this feature." Scrum doesn't describe how to get the stuff into the backlog, and it didn't in the 2013 manuals. The manuals have all been a little bit better, they've all kind of been updated since then, and they do describe it has to start with the vision a little bit more, you have to break down the vision for the product and get in there, but none of that existed in the early versions of Scrum.

(00:18:29):
When people got trained on how to be a product owner, what was happening here is, and this is the whole other world of Scrum over here, when people get trained to be a product owner, it's usually a two-day class where they teach them, "Hey, this is how you break down a backlog. This is how you do stand-ups with your teams. This is how you think about prioritizing work. This is how you manage your backlog, prioritize it for the developers. This is how you work with the retrospectives," but it doesn't teach them about experimentation, it doesn't teach them about market research, it doesn't teach them about data, it doesn't teach them about any of the things that we need to be a product manager.

(00:19:06):
Then what happened was we went into these agile transformations at these companies and they said, "Hey, let's adopt Scrum because Scrum was built as a way to build better products faster." It's literally the tagline. Everybody was like, "Yeah, I want to build products faster. Okay, great. Let's do Scrum." All these large organizations back in the early 2010s, in the 2000s said, "Oh, we got to be better at software. How do we do this better? Otherwise, we're going to lose when it comes to innovation." They adopted Scrum as a way to build software faster.

(00:19:42):
Now, what happened is in order to do Scrum, Scrum basically sells training. That's what Scrum does. All of these agile coaches would come in and teach the product owners, newly minted product owners, took all those people, made them into product owners, put them through a two-day class and then say, "Go." That was the beginning of all the agile transformations, and that's where a lot of companies still are today. This product owner role did not emerge from product management as we know it today, it was a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on, but that was it. The product owner was held accountable for making sure that they were working on the most pressing things or the highest value things, they do say that, but to me, if you look at it from a developer perspective, it's also the person where you can say, "Hey, well, you told me to build that, right? We didn't build it wrong. You told me to build that."

(00:20:35):
It almost gets into consulting territory where you're like, "Okay. If the product owner prioritized all this stuff for me and told me what to do, I can't be held accountable if it was the wrong thing to build." Some of that stuff does come up in a lot of teams that struggle to adopt agile, to adopt Scrum. I feel like there's a big misunderstanding out there about what is this role and what should we be doing, but the premise of this is when we talk about Scrum, it's just one piece of the puzzle, and when people talk about agile now, they almost always associate it with Scrum.

(00:21:10):
I was actually Googling agile methodologies, and like I said, the other ones, Kanbans is an agile methodology, XP is an agile methodology. They don't have product owners, they do not exist in those methodologies. There are four developers to work on things, or teams to work on things. XP would consider product managers in the teams as far as I know it, but Scrum kind of sees it as a separate thing.  Agile methodologies, everybody says, "Oh, they're Scrum now," so it gets a bad connotation out there about what to do with it. I think Scrum if you do it well is bad, but you have to understand that it's just one piece of building great products, it's not the whole thing, and companies will adopt it like it's going to radically transform everything. To be fair, a lot of times it's sold that way too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:59):
There's a bigger picture question that's coming to mind as you talk about this. I'm imagining founders listening to this and smaller companies listening to this be like, "Why do we need any of this?", especially Silicon Valley startups, "We're just going to build stuff. We don't need these frameworks, we don't need a Scrum master. We just have awesome developers and product managers and we're just going to build awesome stuff." I don't know anyone that has worked this way that has built amazing things. Can you talk a bit about who ends up looking for solutions here, where this even comes from, what companies need help here versus, "I just don't need any of this?"

Melissa Perri (00:22:36):
A lot of large companies turn to Scrum or to the frameworks, and it's because they traditionally didn't grow up building software. They're looking at how do I implement something that has rigor at scale, and that's where you see a lot of Scrum come up. Now, I've seen startups using Scrum. Some of them do it fine, they understand that it's just more about trying to get things out the door every two weeks to test it with customers. I think if you keep that philosophy, like I said, I used it and we didn't have a lot of rigor around it, that was fine. When we were doing Scrum, when I did it with my team back in OpenSky, we got to this point where we were like, "Two weeks is too long. We're just going to ship things every week."

(00:23:12):
We just talked to each other, we skipped stand-ups, which is sacrilege in Scrum, but we kipped daily stand-ups. We didn't need to stand around and talk about it, we talked to each other every day. For me, what was amazing and where I see teams actually thrive when they start using Scrum is when you go and talk to people. You're having the conversations about the work, you're breaking it down, you're understanding it, so the developers and the rest of the team can go hit the road running and people can ask important questions. If you're not doing that, that's where I think things like a framework help, but if you already are doing that, you don't need a framework, you don't need Scrum, you don't need to be prescribed to this two-week sprint or anything like that.

(00:23:52):
As long as you have a methodology, it doesn't even have to be a defined methodology. As long as you have a way of working that gets things out to customers, well, who cares? Who actually cares? Where there's a lot of, I think, baggage in the industry and where I hear product managers get really frustrated and other people as well, developers too, is that when you do Scrum by the book or how people teach it and how they write about it, it's a million meetings. I know they were put in there so that people were forced to talk, but when you already know what you're supposed to work on, why do you need to keep doing meetings? Shouldn't you just go do some work?

(00:24:28):
A lot of developers complain, a lot of product managers complain that Scrum has too many meetings and they don't actually get to do work. That's where I think you have to go back to the inspect and adapt part. A lot of people who are very religious about Scrum will come and yell at me about this. They're like, "Oh, well, that's not how it's supposed to be. You're supposed to inspect and adapt." Agree, but a lot of people aren't doing it and that's the piece where you go and you say, "Is this serving us? If not, let's get rid of it. Let's not do those types of things." When you're a small startup, I don't think you need a lot of this overhead. It's really much designed for larger scale companies, and those are the ones that you see really adopting it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:06):
From what I've seen on the data, it's also companies that are as you I think alluded to at the beginning, not necessarily software first, product first companies. Feels like it's very common in banks and telecom companies and companies that aren't product First and software first.

Melissa Perri (00:25:21):
There are SaaS companies that do Scrum out there and they like it, and I don't think they're very dogmatic about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:27):
Got it. Yeah.

Melissa Perri (00:25:28):
They do it for a reason of just trying to provide some more context to their teams about how to work together at scale. I've also seen places where they don't prescribe whatever methodology you want to work with for the teams, but instead they'll spend a lot more effort breaking down the road maps, thinking about what are we going to do each quarter, trying to set those themes, and then they just let the teams run, and that works as well. I think it really depends how they adopt it, but I would say it's not a hard and fast rule that no startups are doing this. Some are doing it, I just don't know how it's going for them. To me, it might be overkill if you're doing that with a team that's pretty experienced in doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):
What I was insinuating is less just Scrum as a general idea and more very structured rigid processes and also product owners. Then there's this whole concept of SAFe that we can talk about. Should we get into that or should we talk about product manager versus product owner and just the challenges people have there?

Melissa Perri (00:26:33):
Let's talk about SAFe because that's where a lot of this started to get Confusing

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):
Okay, cool. Let's go there. Yeah.

Melissa Perri (00:26:37):
Scaled Agile Framework came out of the desire to figure out how do we scale Scrum and different processes and bring it to organizations at scale. It originated from a more structured approach to agile too called Rational Unified Processing. Now, SAFe wasn't the first thing that started at scale. There was also LeSS, which is a Scaled Agile Framework, and then Jeff Sutherland who did Scrum has Scrum@Scale. It's not the only scaling framework out there. There's a lot, there's actually a lot out there, but SAFe was one that was marketed the best. The way it's marketed is will tell you everything you need to do, to do all of your agile teams with Scrum and put them all together.

(00:27:22):
The idea behind SAFe was that Dean Leffingwell came up with it. He wanted to really show how you tie multiple teams together at scale in an organization and how do you bring some rigor and process to that. The executives at really large enterprises, we're talking tens of thousands of people, they love SAFe because it prescribes a lot of an operating model of what to do when it comes to development, but it also gets billed as like, "Hey, this is the whole model for you to go do software." If you look at it, it's a big map that everybody kind of makes fun of a little bit, and it describes all different things on it if you look at the map. You can click in and you can see the definitions and you can see what's going on in the areas.

(00:28:10):
The SAFe image has gotten bigger and bigger over time. I think, what is this? Version six. I do know a lot of people who worked on SAFe, so I know a lot of trainers and I've worked with companies. The first time I was introduced to SAFe was when I was working with a bank back in 2015. I came in to train their product managers, I'm doing my training, we're setting them up on how to go talk to customers, talk about hypotheses, MVP, and somebody came up to me and they said, "Hey, Melissa, all of this is great, but I don't have time to go talk to customers because I'm a product owner." I was like, "Well, what are you doing on a day-to-day basis? What don't you have time for it?", "I got to write my user stories." I'm like, "Okay. How many user stories do you write per day?"

(00:28:53):
This was for the developers to have a full backlog so they could all work, right? She's like, "Oh, yeah. I spend pretty much 40 hours a day writing user stories." I'm like, "On what?" We're like, "What are you controlling?" She's like, "The login API for a bank." I'm like, "Can you log in?" She's like, "Yeah," and I'm like, "So what else are you working on? Is there a new initiative? Is there a new thing?" It's like, "No, I was reorganized into a team where I became the product owner. I have a product manager who goes and talks to customers, but then she comes and she tells me what to build, and then I write the user stories around it and I put it into the backlog for the teams." I was like, "What is this?" Then they said, "That's SAFe. This is what we're working towards."

(00:29:34):
This was my first experience with SAFe, and then I ran into another company that did it, another company, same thing over and over and over again, where all these product owners were just basically trying to keep these backlogs full for developers, and they were working on such a narrow level. When a lot of organizations too I saw it reorganized into agile teams, they did it by component. Everybody was over every tiny little feature, and these teams were massive, super huge scope, and some of the stuff was just not prioritized. It was done, you didn't need to work on it. They were finding work to do so people wouldn't get fired. That's how the product owners operated. There was all this legacy baggage sometimes in companies where they were all re-put on things by component, and they're just making up work to do.

(00:30:21):
SAFe introduced this kind of split between product manager and product owner, and if you look at the map, the product owner is part of the agile team where they sit with the Scrum masters, which is a team coach that they call here and the developers, and then the product manager is sitting with a system architect and what they call a release train engineer. What SAFe does is they pull a bunch of agile teams into a release train and you get on the train when you're ready to ship things and you make sure that it all goes pretty smoothly to get to that potential shippable increment or that big feature launch that you would be doing with SAFe. 

(00:30:58):
SAFe's really good at prescribing how to do that, they're great at describing how to do the release trains, how to bring those teams together, how to put them on it. Then they do this thing called big room planning where they get the entire release train together, all these teams, they put them in a room and in every quarter you're breaking down what we're all going to work on. Where I hear frustration from teams every time I come in and train them is that when you do big room planning, a lot of times it's a commitment. You start at the quarter, they haven't been doing good discovery because remember, these people have not been trained on good discovery so they don't really know what they should be working on, they haven't been out talking to customers a lot of times. They kind of scramble, they figure out what needs to happen. Usually they have a backlog of stuff that does need to happen, it just has to get done. They map it all out in a big room together, they commit to it, and then that's the quarter.

(00:31:47):
They ask me, "When am I supposed to do discovery?" I'm like, "Well before that ideally you should have a vision. You should be breaking it down, you should be putting discovery into that vision, talking to customers, feeding that in there." Then I hear, "We don't have time to do that because we sprint back to back." I was like, "What does that mean?", and they're like, "As a team, we go and we basically do two-week sprint into two-week sprint into two-week sprint, and I got to make sure my developers are full. I got to make sure they have things to work on. If I go take time off to go talk to customers, which also is not my job as a product owner, it's my product manager's job, they'll feed me in what the customers are saying, then I break those down into features and I can work with the developers on it." That's how all of this stuff starts going.

(00:32:32):
What happens in organizations that they don't understand here is that it's not the most efficient way to work. I see a lot of developers out there become almost ... How do you describe it? Reliant on the product manager or product owner to tell them what to do. Even though you build them this great vision and you explain what needs to happen, they go, "Oh, I can't work on it because the product owner hasn't prioritized it." Then they asked me, "If I don't have enough for the developers to do on feature work, what are they supposed to do?" I said, "I guarantee you there's a ton of tech debt they could be working on. You don't have to scope that out. Let them choose what's the most important thing. They should be working together as developers and architects to figure out how to tackle some of that tech debt, how to get into it while you're figuring out is this the right thing to be building."

(00:33:23):
With all of this stuff, people feel like they don't have time because they're in a million meetings, and the expectations of these companies is that every sprint, we're delivering software towards these roadmaps that we promised in the last quarter and we're not checking to see if they're right, we're not checking to see if they're actually helping us move it forward, and a lot of times the organizations are not set up with the right feedback mechanisms, the right user research and the right data to tell us if everything is working so they can feed that in to the next release planning. They're just planning, planning, planning, breaking it down into sprints and going.

(00:33:58):
SAFe is not good at describing how you do all that other work. In a lot of this stuff too, there's pieces that they put onto this map of SAFe where they're like, "Hey, you should do OKRs," and it's like, "This is what OKRs are. You should do a roadmap. This is what a roadmap is." How all of that cycle works together where you're balancing discovery and delivery and feeding it in is really confusing in organizations. Then what it's basically saying is a lot of the discovery work goes into the product managers, and the product managers, the product owners report into the product managers. What I've seen that doesn't work here is that you're basically making these product owners order-takers. They are extremely tactical, and then when it's time to actually be more strategic, let's say you want to be promoted to a product manager, some organizations, that's not even the same business line, not even the same career path. It's product owners go over here and product managers go here and they report into different people.

(00:34:58):
If you ever want to move from product owner to product manager, a lot of times you don't get experience with the strategy, figuring out what customers want, breaking it down, looking at the market research, determining is this valuable, is this what we should be working on. They're not even getting exposure or a chance to do that because SAFe is like, "No, that's the product manager's job. Your job is to go really deep and work with the developers."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):
Wow, okay. A lot of this sounds quite absurd as someone hearing all of the details and looking at this image. That being said, many companies are adopting this. It feels like it's growing. More and more companies are adopting this as the way to work. I imagine the incentive is we just want to build great software and we don't know exactly how, and there's this process we can plug in and it'll help us do it. I guess thoughts on that, and do you find it can work or often works or often doesn't work? What is your experience with people adopting this and how it goes?

Melissa Perri (00:35:59):
I know a ton of companies that adopted SAFe about eight years ago and have gotten rid of it. Capital One just came out and said they got rid of all their agile roles, all their Scrum roles. They were early adopter of SAFe, they don't do it anymore. They wrote about that in the newspaper. I've seen it happen more often. Now, in a lot of our organizations too I'll see parts of them do SAFe and other parts not do SAFe. It could change business line to business line. I don't think though that people grasp how much it's still out there. I get questions on SAFe every single day on the podcast. Everybody asks me, "Why are we still doing this?" It's for what you said, executives buy SAFe because it's the only framework out there that basically draws them a map and says, "Plug and play, do this."

(00:36:50):
That's why everybody's so excited about it because it's the only thing that specifies things to this level, and they went, "Oh, it's something I can understand, it's something that actually has definitions around it." To be fair, that was a great thing for SAFe to do as a marketing tool. Bravo, they created this thing that everybody wants, a good product to sell, but it's overkill, and that's what I keep hearing from organizations is it's basically taking the responsibility away from leaders to go figure their stuff out themselves as well. If you are a new leader and you've just been dropped into this role, I have tremendous empathy for them because yeah, where do you get started? How do you try to run a technology organization?

(00:37:33):
Somebody came and told me, the CIO came and told me I'm in charge now. I'm in charge of all of the developers, or I'm in charge of all the product managers. Now, where do you start? I can totally tell why people adopt SAFe because you're like, "Oh, I've been looking for the handbook. I've been looking for something to do here." The problem is it's only solving a little bit of the puzzle, which is bringing those teams together. People do say it does really strains well, but it doesn't tell you also how to do your job as a leader, it leaves it all out. They talk about portfolio visions and portfolio management and SAFe there too, but more often than not, I come in and I find everybody above product owners and product managers, let's talk about directors of product, VPs of product, they don't know what they should be doing as a VP of product or a director of product. It's like, "What's my role? What should I be feeding in here?"

(00:38:23):
SAFe doesn't even have that in there, that's not even a role. Product manager going up into those levels is not really there. What do you do when you own a whole product line in an organization? What you do when you're the head of product for a credit card at a bank, right? What's my job? Doesn't say that. There's a lot of people out there in these organizations that I've been working with who I'm like, "You are supposed to be doing strategy, and this is how you do strategy. This is how you go out and talk to customers. This is the patterns that we have in software. Are you doing a platform strategy? Do you need APIs? How do you think about your app strategy, rolling it out? How do you do this here?" All of that stuff doesn't quite come from ways of working, which is what SAFe is doing. It's about how do you do your jobs in those areas?

(00:39:12):
A lot of organizations who adopt SAFe don't realize that you need a head of product, you need somebody to actually be feeding that vision all the way down and make sure it's breaking up around the teams and controlling that portfolio vision and doing all of these things into it. I have not seen SAFe slowing down by any means out there for people adopting it, I see more and more organizations adopting it. I think we take for granted too in Silicon Valley how many people are just starting on their journey for digital transformation. There's a lot of pharmaceutical companies, banks, insurance companies, they outsource their development or they had an IT team, but they never had to really think about it before because digital wasn't as important. Now they do.

(00:39:59):
Some of these companies, most of these companies are Fortune 50 companies, right? Fortune 100 companies. I think a lot of the ones I see, at least banks, realized early on, "Hey, when it comes to apps and how people interact with our stuff, software is important," but there's a lot of companies that did not catch that train and they're just starting, and then they turn to things like SAFe because it gives them a guideline. "Hey, I've never done this before. I've been in this bank for 40 years. All I know is waterfall type development. What do we do?" Then we'll go, "We'll go look at SAFe."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:33):
I love that we spend time on that because I think it's really important. You can be cynical about all this and be like, "What the hell are people thinking? This is crazy," but as you described, people just have a problem to solve, they've never done this before, they look for solutions, they find something that seems right, they see other people doing this and like, "Okay, let's try this thing." What you've seen is it rarely actually works out the SAFe specific approach.

(00:40:59):
There's a few ways I think we can help folks. One is someone trying to do say an agile transformation or a digital transformation, your advice for how to actually do that better. Then I want to talk about say you're a product owner or a PM within an organization that works like this. What can you do? Maybe let's start with the first. Say someone's trying to figure out, "We need to build better products. Something's not working right." SAFe is an option. Your suggestion is don't maybe do that. What should people do? I know you're not going to have the answer in a short answer, but generally, how should people approach this?

Melissa Perri (00:41:33):
Yeah. When I've worked with companies on digital transformations, you want a development operating model. That's where a lot of these agile methodologies came out of. You have to understand that's just the development operating model, that's not actually going to help you with go-to-market, with launching your products and with product management. What I advise for companies to do is first sit down and say, "Hey, how do we think about building our operating model?" When I think of product operating models and what I do with companies is we break out how do you determine product strategy? Do you have a good product strategy? You look at your organizational design. How are we actually organized around our products? Do we have good coverage of product managers and do we have skilled product managers up and down the organization?

(00:42:20):
Then we want to look at product operations. Do we have the infrastructure in there to help support these teams? Can they get the data to make decisions? Can they actually be in touch with customers? A lot of these large organizations haven't actually thought through many of those steps as well that enable product managers and development teams to be successful. They don't have ways for them to go and talk to customers. That's why they're not doing it. I have a lot of empathy for people in these organizations as well who can't do product management well because of the bureaucracy or the things around it. Leaders need to solve that, right? They need to understand what the role is and they need to open it up.

(00:42:57):
Then we got to look at our culture and incentives. Are we just rewarding people for shipping as many things as possible, which is like, "Hey, just put everything you possibly can into that release train or that backlog," or are we coming back and saying, "Hey, is this valuable? Is this tying it back to our business?" Many organizations do not have a great product strategy, many large organizations that I've worked with, and it's that tying it back to the value piece, tying it back to, is this going to reach our company goals? If you are a huge organization and let's say making billions of dollars a year, and your goal is expand geographically, what are you doing in your portfolio to actually enable that? What products are you building to expand geographically? So many organizations don't have the transparency to actually even see that.

(00:43:50):
One crazy thing, a lot of people give large organizations a lot of flack for, and I know Marty does this too, for focusing on processes. I don't think processes are the enemy here. For example, if I hear somebody really worried about getting a roadmapping tool in there or something like that, I'm like, "Yes, you need that because you have no idea what your 4,000 teams are doing." If they're actually coming back to the business goals, you have no infrastructure in there to be able to see that transparency. Those types of blocking tackling is absolutely necessary for a transformation for a organization to be stood up around software product management. You have to have the transparency to actually see those things.

(00:44:29):
You do need to have enough process so that you as an organization can be efficient in getting things out the door, and that's what I think SAFe was trying to do, but it's not working because it's not solving the problems of the product management and it's not solving that problem of connecting the value back to the product teams. Instead, it's seen as a role that almost babysits developers or tells everybody what to do. Where's the discovery? Where do those things come in? I know with the SAFe image that we got over here, they try to drop things like Lean UX in there, which Jeff Gothelf thinks it's hilarious, but it's not really pulling it all together of how do we do this on a cadence? How do we help people go out there and actually talk to customers? How do we enable them to do it?

(00:45:15):
If you're starting a transformation, it's not just thinking about how do we build the product, but you should also be thinking about how do we launch the product and how do we make sure this is the right product to do. That's the big pieces of it, and that's where all that product strategy comes in. You should also look at the career paths. This is what really bothers me about agile transformations and what bothers me with Scrum and SAFe is that when we organized in these large organizations into agile teams, we made all these new roles called a product owner, and so many organizations don't have a career path for them so they email me and they go, "What's my career path? What do I do next? Where am I supposed to go?"

(00:45:59):
I've been saying for 10 years, this is not a team role, it's not just a team role, it's a business role and it rolls all the way up to helping you further your business. You have to make sure that people on teams can be promoted to running multiple teams, can be promoted to running an entire product line. To us, that's so simple in Silicon Valley native software companies, but it's still unheard of in other organizations. What happens too, and this is where I think leadership and C-suite needs to really pay attention, because we're transforming in this way of working, what happens is some of the roles that we had before do not serve us now. Maybe we don't need a million project managers, maybe people in the business who decided what we're going to build, are they the right people to bring with us on this next phase into product management? Can they learn? Can they grok software? Do they understand those pieces? That's what we have to ask.

(00:46:58):
Organizations are so afraid sometimes to put these career ladders in because it kind of overhauls their traditional ways of working, and then they've got people who've been in these organizations for 40 years and now you're saying, "Hey, you're actually not in charge of that, the product manager is in charge of that," and that's scary. A lot of them get in the way because of that. If you really want to transform though, the C-suite has to be like, "Hey, we're going in this direction," and just put it down because I've seen it run by a lot of middle managers, a transformation run by tons of middle managers, and those are the jobs that are usually in most jeopardy when you start transforming and you have to re-skill and you have to figure out what to do, and they don't want to do that. They're not going to be the ones who jump up and down and say, "Hey, let's do this."

(00:47:41):
There's a lot of people out there, I think, pushing organizations to try harder and to internally as well. I've worked with a lot of people who run these transformations who just really want it to work, and I think they do it with the best of intentions, but the C-suite has to understand this is not just a transformation project, this is a whole new way of working, and if we want a whole new way of working, we have to really rise to that occasion.

There's a few things I want to pull out from what you just shared. One is, just to clarify, you recommend not using SAFe, you don't think that's a good approach?

Melissa Perri (00:49:21):
I do not recommend using SAFe. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:24):
Great.

Melissa Perri (00:49:25):
There are people who like SAFe. Let me just say this, there are people who found success with SAFe. Every single person I have talked to who like SAFe found success with SAFe, they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else. It's not actually SAFe by the book. If you do that, fine, that's any process. If you ended up adopting SAFe and you want to go back and look at it and say, "Actually let's just get rid of all the stuff that's not working and keep the stuff that is," fine, but being open to understanding this is not the way that we do good product management. There's not a lot in SAFe about doing good product management. That's the stuff that we have to understand. It could help in certain areas, and I do think it does help in certain areas, bring some rigor to things, but if you take it too far, it will destroy things.

(00:50:17):
There's actually a great story about a water company in the Netherlands and they decided to adopt SAFe, and this was on the news a couple months ago. They decided to adopt SAFe in their IT teams and start working with it. They ended up going bankrupt, and the reason they ended up going bankrupt is because the teams were learning the processes for SAFe, they were taking so long to deploy their new invoicing system and payment collections that they couldn't collect payments from customers because they got so caught up in the process.

(00:50:53):
That's what I see happen a lot in these organizations. Instead of talking about what's really important, which is, "Hey, how are we serving our customers? How are we winning in this market? How do we stem churn? How do we do all these things?", we're talking instead about, "What stand-ups are we doing? Oh, how do we do this release planning? Oh, my God, you guys didn't sprint back to back, you did it wrong." We're talking about work about work, but we're not actually getting into what are we achieving here, and that's the part I do not like about rigid processes when it comes to this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:28):
That touches on the other theme I wanted to bring up is it feels like the stuff is a kind of replacement for skilled, talented people, a product leader that understands how to do these things and has product taste and has organized teams to build great product. It feels like people are just, "We don't have that so we're going to create this. This process is going to fix all our problems." Can you talk about just the importance of that, the people you hire to run these things as key to this, if that's true?

Melissa Perri (00:52:00):
In a lot of organizations, the people who buy SAFe, they have not run large scale technology organizations before, or they're new to this way of working so they adopt SAFe and they hope it works because it looks like a nice plan, like we said, to go out and do things. When you're doing a transformation, a lot of companies are pulling people into these roles for the first time. I've said since day one that I've been working with companies, it's okay and I think it's noble to want to train people and put them in different roles. Cool. If you're going to spend money upskilling your people, do that, but you also have to intersperse people who know what they're doing. I think at leadership it's really important to bring in somebody who knows what they're doing to help run this type of thing.

(00:52:44):
There are more people out there and more leaders who have done this before because we've been doing this for 10 years. There's Shruti Patel, she's chief product officer at US Bank for small business banking. I just had her on the podcast. She worked at Shopify, she saw how great teams worked, and then she was able to come and help apply that at a bank. She's experienced, right? She's an experienced product person who comes in to help. Melissa Douros is the CPO of Green Dot Bank and she had worked at Discover Financial leading the transformation there, did all that work, and then could bring it to Green Dot Bank. She can see what needs to happen, what needs to actually go on here.

(00:53:23):
We've got more and more people out there who have done this before who are looking for these opportunities to do it in the bank, and I think it's important for C-suite to bring them in to actually look at that. Where I've seen transformations be the most successful in all these organizations is when you do that mix, you keep some of your people, but you also bring people in to learn. I get hired all the time to come in and train. I've worked with almost every Fortune 50 company at this point, fortune 100 company too, and I get in, I come in to train a lot of product managers. We do it through Product Institute and we'll train everybody. What used to happen about eight years ago is they train everybody and they would say, "Go." Where do you go after you bring in the consultants to do training to keep learning? How do they watch other people in the organization do great product management if there's nobody in the organization who's done it before?

(00:54:20):
Luckily I think a lot of organizations are realizing that, so more leaders are out there who are saying, "Hey, I've got to actually intersperse skills here. I need to bring in some more directors who are experienced here, some more individual contributors who are experienced here." Those organizations I think are wildly successful because they recognize it and they say, "I've got to make sure that people can learn from others." That's how you keep developing, that's how we all keep developing, it's not just doing all external classes. That's where I think these things become powerful. You could do that at all levels. You don't have to just do it with the teams, you could do it at director level, you could do it at VP level. That's how we should be thinking about this.

(00:54:57):
Now, there are some CPOs out there and some VPs of product in these large organizations who are new to this way of working, but they've committed themselves to learning and to trying to figure out how to do it best. They're not saying, "Hey, I'm just going to adopt SAFe or I'm just going to do whatever is over here," they're actually saying, "What don't I know?" I'm watching them go out to talk to other CPOs, do all these other things. They usually have great market knowledge, great business knowledge, and they're fantastic at strategy, and then they hire people underneath them who are great at the other pieces like the execution and getting the software at the door. I think those people are successful in it as well because they notice their skill gaps and they hire for it just like any great leader would.

(00:55:41):
In these organizations, I do see sometimes SAFe for something being a crutch for people who don't know what they're doing to bring in. If you really think about, "Hey, how do I make this better?", and have that continuous learning mindset and that way to want to propel this forward, I think you'll consider other options and start to think about broader than just SAFe, broader than just agile, what do we need to make this successful?

(00:56:07):
The key part of this too is recognizing that product management is not just this role in Scrum. I say this in my talk too, I say Take Scrum away. You still need product management, right? Product owner doesn't exist without Scrum, that's not a thing, but you still need product managers and that's why all product owners should be product managers, they should be fundamentally product managers. That's why I do not like these career trajectories that keep them separate. Sure, if you want to have a principal IC product manager like they do in a lot of large Silicon Valley companies, perfect, let people keep working on those things. They don't have to go into management, but that doesn't mean they're different. Between an IC product owner and an IC product manager, it shouldn't be different there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):
Perfect segue to where I wanted to go next, which is say you are a product owner today listening to this and you're like, "Man, this is exactly my life. What can I do?", what's your advice to folks in that role right now about how to potentially become product managers, build the skills they need to not just be stuck in this career path that doesn't go anywhere?

Melissa Perri (00:57:14):
Yeah. I think the first thing is bringing awareness to that your role is more than just working with the developers. A lot of leaders argue with me that we need product owners because it just doesn't scale. You've seen massive companies at scale where they don't have any product owners. I do not understand that. It's a weak argument to me, it's a very weak argument. It just means you don't know how to distribute the work evenly and give a little bit of strategic guidance to product owners so that they can gon, or product managers, on a team so that they can go and build visions and cut down features and stuff like that. If you're a product owner and you're like, "Hey, I don't have the opportunity to talk to customers, my product manager does that. I am just working with the teams. I want to be more strategic, I want to think longer term," I'd say try to take some ownership over that and push back on the things that are being given to you.

(00:58:04):
I was doing a workshop for Mind the Product back in the day, and I had a product owner in my workshop and she said, "I don't think that things we're working on," they were doing SAFe, "are the right things to work on." I said, "You should bring this to your manager," and she was like, "I don't know. I'm going to get fired. I don't think it's the right thing. What am I going to work on if we're not going to work on this?" I'm like, "Well, this is the beauty of product instead of project, we stay with the product." Just because your project ends doesn't mean that you lose a job. She put together this whole thing, went and said, "I don't think we should be working on this," and they promoted her. They were like, "Fantastic." She took this leap of faith and went out there and started saying, "This is more. We need to do more."

(00:58:44):
I think if you're a product owner and there's no career path for you, start asking leaders what your career path is because it's going to make them go, "Oh, great question. What should the career path be?" There's a lot of literature out there about how we make career paths, so you can start there. Ask what's next for you after this product owner role. I would ask the product managers if they're doing all the customer research, see if you can do some customer research with them. Go sit in on this. A lot of them will say, "I don't have time. I don't have time to do this." Strip back all the user stories you're working on, stop thinking about it as a quantitative metric that needs to just go up and up. Instead, really think about the value you're delivering with your team. Is this the right thing?

(00:59:24):
When you talk to leaders and when you present your case, you say it in a way of, "Hey, I'm working on X, Y, and Z feature. What's the goal here? When we release this, what do we hope will happen?" I think that's one of the best questions anybody can ask if they're worried their company is not focused on outcomes. What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics are we going to change? How do we instrument it to make sure that's true? Then we can go back and actually see if it changed. One simple question to get alignment on it, and then you can start to say, "Oh, that didn't work or this did work." Great. Why did it work? You can open up those conversations.

(01:00:00):
I'd say there's a lot of things you can do to help move your companies forward, and I have seen in a lot of these organizations too, a groundswell of product owners and product managers saying, "Hey, what's next for me? What's going on?" That makes the organizations go and figure it out. I was working with one Fortune 10 company not too long ago, their C-suite, I've been working with them for a very long time and they're finally like, "Hey, we're going to codify the product manager role and we're going to have it all the way up and down our organization, we're going to make roles, we're going to make responsibilities." To me, that was music to my ears, but the reason they were doing it too is because they noticed there was a lot of churn in the organization in that role, and they also realized it's a critical role.

(01:00:44):
They're losing good people because people from the outside are coming because they want to work for this great big organization that's doing super well, fantastic, but they get in there and they go, "Where's my career path? What am I supposed to do? Where am I supposed to go?" A lot of leaders are out there now realizing, "Hey, we do have to get our stuff together," and the only reason they're coming to this conclusion as well is because they're looking around seeing other people doing it and they hear it from the teams, they hear it from the product managers. I don't want people to think, "Hey, I have no power. I'm in a 10,000 person organization." The more you bring this up, the more your leaders will respect it because they don't want to lose you, they don't want to lose good people. If you want to be great at your job and you need more support there, speak up, speak up.

(01:01:31):
At a certain point, I do tell people this. If you feel like you can't do great product management in your organization, try to find another organization. I know that is hard to say and I respect people are tied to insurances and it's hard to change jobs, but if you do have the opportunity to look for another organization that does it well, I would go there. I would also say in large corporations too, I've seen certain business lines and certain divisions do it super well and then others not. If you are in a large corporation, maybe think about moving internally, laterally to a different team and seeing if you can work there. I'd find the leaders who know what they're doing and go work for that. That's usually the best move here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:11):
The point you made about how a lot of companies don't have any product owners and have scaled very wide, just to reinforce that in the data dive that we did on job market trends, no tech company has a product owner basically, no top tech company. I know there's an important distinction here. These are tech, software first, product first businesses where their business is the software they're building, and a lot of the companies we're talking about here are not that. They're banks and telecoms, pharmaceutical companies. I get that it's a very different world, but I think it's important to highlight, "You can become very big." Google has no product owners as far as I know, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, no company you've heard of that's a tech company has a product owner. They're all product managers, they're all product managers.

Melissa Perri (01:02:56):
Yeah. I don't want people to think that there aren't people who build great software in these large corporations too because there are. There's pockets of people who are doing it super, super well. If you are one of those people who's been pushing the boundaries, doing great work, and your title is a product owner, what I always tell people on your resume, if you're looking for your next job so that you're not pushed out, let's say, of these large corporations like a Google or somewhere like that, and that's where you want to work in a tech firm, make sure you describe how you did your job from a value perspective. Do not talk about your agile cadences. Get Scrum out of there. Talk about what value you brought to the users and what metrics you moved, and that's how your resume should be laid out.

(01:03:40):
I do read tons of resumes to hire people, and also chief product officer, same thing. If I see immediately implemented Scrum processes across the organization, I'm like, "No, that's not what I need. That's not what I was looking for." I was looking for what are you going to do to push the strategy in that part of the organization? What are you going to do to actually build better products for customers? Then when you get into the interview, you can talk about what things you did to do that, but you want to make sure that you're focused on really understanding the customer and translating that into great products, and the outcomes that we were looking for when you do it on your resume, I think that's important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):
Okay. I want to spend more time here because this is so important. This is highlighting here's the difference between a product owner and a product manager. If you want to move into product management and become a great PM, if you're a product owner today, even if you're not a product owner and just want to get into product management, can you again just highlight here's the big difference and here's the skills that people value most in a PM versus a product owner.

Melissa Perri (01:04:38):
Yeah. When I see product owners write out their resumes or describe their job functions, they always approach it from a process standpoint. I prioritize the backlog, I worked with the developers to break down the work, I checked the developer's work and did the acceptance criteria, I wrote the user stories, all those functions is what I see over and over and over again in product owner resume. What you want to do instead is say, "I led the," we can even do the login API,"I led the work around the login API. The problem that I was solving around it was trying to enhance security for our login protocols to meet regulatory requirements. I interviewed a bunch of users, I got up to speed on the regulatory requirements, I worked really closely with our legal teams and our compliance teams to translate that into something that was going to secure our bank, and when we launched, we were able to meet our compliance, save our bank a couple million dollars, and we smoothly transitioned into these new security requirements without disrupting any service for customers for four million customers."

(01:05:40):
Way different story than I prioritized backlog and I shipped it off to developers. Take it a step further. If you're working on customer-facing things, who are your customers? Did you go out and talk to them? By interfacing with customers and understanding them, I was able to solve XY, and Z problem with them, which resulted in a measurable amount of XY and Z metric going up for the business. I ran this function, I ran this feature, I launched this feature, I watched it through, I iterated on it, I did the stuff that was needed to make this successful. That's what I want to see on a resume.

(01:06:15):
Even if you have a product owner title, I'll still read the details and everybody else will too, but I will say there's sometimes a poor connotation when you have that title unfortunately because of the baggage that's associated with agile. Even just on resumes, I would say do product owner/product manager in there just to let people know that I know how to do this and I've been doing this well. If you do that in your bullet points, that shows up as well. There's also this whole concept that we didn't even get into about certifications. People keep asking me if I want to transition into product management, should I get a certification, an agile certification?" I feel like these were bigger a couple years ago, but they're still big. If you ever see somebody with a CSPO on the end of their profile, which you probably have seen on LinkedIn, it's a certified Scrum product owner.

(01:07:05):
Now, one thing to remember, and this is about all agile stuff, is we call it the agile industrial complex, agile coaches and agile trainers, the whole Scrum team, scrum.org, Scrum Inc, SAFe, everybody, the way they make their money is through consulting to teach you these processes and by having people be trained to get these certifications. They come in and they say, "All your people need to be certified Scrum product owners. Give me 2,500 bucks per person," and then they get a certificate at the end of a two-day class that says they're a certified Scrum product owner. It doesn't necessarily mean they could do the job, it doesn't necessarily mean they could do product management, but let's think about when we're talking about too should we adopt SAFe in general, should we adopt these things, think about how these organizations make money.

(01:07:56):
They're selling certifications. Of course they want more and more people to adopt it. That's the idea here. They're selling you this dream that you just certify all your people and then you could be working on it. They take all these people, they put them in two-day classes or whatever, and they turn them out and then they say, "Go, you're a completely new role." It doesn't work that way. That's not in the best interest of your company, that's not really what we're looking for here, and that's why all of this stuff needs to go deeper. If you've done a CSPO class and you have that certification, it may help you get hired at another large enterprise that is adopting Scrum and SAFe. That will probably help you there.

(01:08:36):
If you want to transition into tech and go into the companies that we talk about, they're probably going to look at that and say, "This person doesn't know what they're doing. This is not here." If you do know what you're doing and you did that for a reason, because some people need that to get promoted, some companies actually require it, which is crazy, but to get promoted or be that thing, I have tremendous sympathy for that, but you're going to have to do a lot of work explaining in your resumes and stuff as you transition that you know more than that. You're not just a CSPO with a two-day class, you have done the work. That's where all of this building up on your resume becomes really, really important. It's not just about getting certified.

(01:09:14):
I had people ask me, they're like, "Can you just certify product managers?" I'm like, "No. If people take my course, I give them a certificate of completion and as a completion." You finished a course just like any other course, but I will not certify product managers because I do not think you can ever say somebody is prepared and able to do their job from a short class. Now, there are some agile agencies that do a lot more training where you have different levels, and what they would do is they would train people, but then they would make them go do work and they had a coach that they worked with, and they go back and forth and they could demonstrate that they could do the work over time to get to the next level.

(01:09:56):
It's almost like the PMP, the project management certification where you have to have time actually doing the job. That's different, that's a different type of skill, it's a different type of certification, but if you see any CSPOs, it's typically a two-day workshop that they went to and then got certified. That's the difference with this. I would say be careful if you are a product owner wanting to be a product manager of just certifications. All the large tech organizations I know too, they're not looking for certifications in product management or product ownership to hire people, they're looking for experience, but the organizations that might not know what they're doing, they are looking for CSPOs, they are looking for that.

(01:10:37):
If it's required by your organization, you might have to ask, "Are we all well set up here to do our best job? Is this the place where I'm going to learn how to be a better product manager?" I also feel bad though for people because it's hard to be a product manager, it's hard to get your foot in the door. I'm so torn on it because there are organizations that hire people with a CSPO and they require it, so of course if it gets your foot in the door and it helps you do it, but if it's not going to help you and it's not going to put you on the career path you want, I don't think it's worth money.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:14):
I think one interesting thread throughout this whole conversation is rarely is a plug-in play-ish easy solution going to be the answer to your problem, whether it's plugging in SAFe and it's going to help us build great software, taking a class helping you become a great product manager, be skeptical of that.

Melissa Perri (01:11:31):
Yeah. There's no quick way to doing any of this, there's no fast track. You don't get to skip over all the hard things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:39):
Yeah. Bummer.

Melissa Perri (01:11:41):
Yeah. I wish.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:43):
Yeah. One question I wanted to clarify. When you come into an org and they have product owners, do you encourage them to get rid of product owner as a title and role and make them product managers or do you keep product owners?

Melissa Perri (01:11:53):
I say that we should have a hierarchy. You would have all product managers on a team, they would be an IC, individual contributor, so they're either an associate product manager and that's if they don't have all the discovery experience or maybe they know basic Scrum, totally fine, you can be an associate product manager, but if they don't know how to talk to customers, digest what the customers are saying and turn that into a feature direction and a backlog and this is how we're going to work, all that stuff needs to be in there. If they don't know how they should be measuring things, you're not quite a product manager yet.

(01:12:28):
Associate product manager, and then product manager, and then a senior PM. A senior PM can work on a Scrum team as well or a development team. I do encourage them, I say, "Get rid of these two different titles because it's confusing everybody." I help a lot of people with career paths too. I've seen companies with 47 different titles for product managers because somebody in this organization is called a product associate and somebody over here is a product manager and that person is a platform product manager, and that person is a platform product owner, and this person is an API product owner. You can have product manager, senior product manager, all that stuff, but I would not confuse people with the two different titles of product owner versus product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:11):
But importantly, there's a bar for who is called a product manager because if you take a product owner as you've said, and say you're a product manager, they're going to be a terrible product manager. Your advice is make them an associate PM, and then once they reach a certain level, they've graduated to product manager.

Melissa Perri (01:13:28):
It depends. I don't say this as a hard and fast rule because there are product owners out there who've been doing their job very well. Just because they have a title of a product owner doesn't mean that somebody can't do the job of a product manager. There are plenty of people out there who were just named this because a company names them that and they know what they're doing, so don't look at that hard and fast. When we do this, we typically will say everybody's got product owner on their title, change it to product manager, but we will go back and look at what is the actual skillset.

(01:13:56):
When I've come in to work with companies on transformations, what we typically do, the way I get introduced usually is we come in and they're looking for some kind of training for all of their product teams, and then we bring in Product Institute and we do our online training, Then afterwards I work with the organization, I say, "Now that everybody's been baselined and trained, we have to figure out who is going to be a great product manager and who's not," so there's an awareness. You know what's interesting? Once people figure out what the job's about, a lot of them opt out.

(01:14:24):
When I did the transformation at Athenahealth, we had 365 product managers and they all had different titles too, product innovation, all over the place. We turned them into product managers, we trained everybody, we gave everybody the opportunity to learn, which I think is great, and then we gave them opportunity to practice their skills. What happened is at the end of the training, a lot of people raised their hand and said, "Oh, no, no, this is not what I wanted to do. I thought it was very different. I did not realize how much people work it was. I have to go influence these people, I have to do all this stuff. This is actually not really what I wanted to do."

(01:14:59):
We found other roles for them that were what they wanted to do or they decided to leave. That was up to them, we didn't cut anybody, but we moved some people into operations because they wanted to be a little more heads down to find process. That was their thing. We moved people into data roles who were good with SQL and were good with data analysis. We moved people into user research roles because they wanted to talk to customers, but they didn't want the responsibility and the accountability that came with the product management piece because they realized it was so intense.

(01:15:29):
I've seen this happen a lot in large organizations. You baseline everybody, you show them what the role is and then you let them go practice it, and then at that point some people will opt out and then you have to go back through your people and say, "Okay. How do we level-set now? Who's doing really well? Who's not doing so well? Which teams need to have more experienced people on it because they don't have anybody to learn from?" That's where we would say, "Hey, let's hire some ICs over here or a director of product management who can help train these people and help them keep growing." That's been super successful. I've seen people bring in some more directors, scattered them around, and they've leveled up these product owners who were not necessarily doing great product management and now they're doing fantastic.

(01:16:13):
I've watched fantastic leaders in these organizations that are not software native or doing these transformations. Bringing the right person, you can make amazing product managers. Give them a year or two and completely turn it around. It's totally possible. It's totally possible to take people and train them, and I firmly believe in that, but you got to get them exposure to what good looks like. If you are in an organization and you cannot see what good looks like anywhere, that's a red flag. That's where leaders need to look at their organization and say, "Do I have people with these skills interspersed around so that everybody can start to learn, so that everybody can actually be on the uptake of this and make sure that we are well-balanced?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:56):
That was an awesome nuance and addition. I'm just looking back at all the things we've talked about. We've covered so much ground, the history of agile and Scrum and SAFes and product owners, we've gotten into all kinds of advice on how to do this better as a company leader, as a product owner, as someone thinking about even moving through product management. Is there anything else that we have not covered that you think might be helpful to touch on or wrap up on?

Melissa Perri (01:17:25):
I think I would tell people to remember that when you look at agile methodologies, and if you look at it with small agile, what we are really saying there is we want to be able to move quickly and deliver great value to customers. If you embrace those principles, you're going to do well, but if you think of agile as just a defined super cut and dry process where you have to follow every single little step here and there, that's not going to serve you because you're not getting back into why are we doing this.

(01:17:54):
There are some great agile coaches out there. There are first principle approaches to doing great product work and doing great development work. They're there because they are not just selling Scrum, they are there to make people better. Those agile coaches I think can make great fantastic teams, and I've worked with a lot of them, and I think they are really there to just make it a better environment for the people who are working and to help the company produce better products. That's their whole goal.

(01:18:21):
Then there are people too who are wedded to this is SAFe and you will do it by the book. This is Scrum, you will do it by the book. I'd be very skeptical of that because what's the end goal? What's their end goal? Like I said, a lot of people out there get paid by certifying people and by consulting on these processes. McKinsey made a huge division to do this, and a lot of SAFe was actually introduced to organizations from McKinsey and from large organizations, consulting organizations like that. They came in and they said, "Yeah, this is what you do. I'll teach you how to do SAFe, I'll teach you how to do Scrum." They have been building those consulting agencies off of agile transformations.

(01:19:03):
We always laugh when I talk to other people who've been doing transformations and coaches. I go, "Why is McKinsey always coming in here and doing this?" I've followed them into so many organizations and I've been like, "Oh, wow, they screwed this up. Let me go fix it." There's always a saying that nobody gets fired for hiring McKinsey. McKinsey's big, people trust their name. A lot of the people at McKinsey haven't done this before, they've never been inside the organization trying to transform it and stay there for a long time. That's why I'd be really skeptical of who's selling that.

(01:19:37):
If you approach agile from a perspective of I want to be agile because I want to release things quickly and get feedback from customers and make sure that that's great, look at all of your processes like that and say, "Is that serving the best interest of our company and our culture and our customers? Is this making our customers proud of us? Is this helping our customers receive good value?" If your processes aren't, fix them, change them, inspect and adapt, ease a lowercase agile principle. We should be looking at every process we do and saying, "Is it working?", and not be afraid to change it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:15):
I think it's important to highlight this can work. There are ways to reorganize the way you build product at a very large company where you can actually deliver great product consistently. You've seen that happen a lot. Anything you want to add there to give people hope?

Melissa Perri (01:20:30):
Yeah. The biggest pushback I hear from large organizations, especially ones that are not software native as banks or insurance companies, whatever it is, is that we're not like Google, we're not like SaaS companies. It's true, you're not a SaaS company. The way that you do it is going to be slightly different than the way that Amazon runs or the way that Google runs. I don't see many companies actually run the same, and just because it works at Google doesn't mean it's going to work at an insurance company that's a hundred years old. That's okay, but you could still learn from people who've been producing software at scale for many, many years. You can still learn what makes them successful, and then you could take some of those principles and apply them to your organization and then figure out where we need to adapt. That's what I would look at.

(01:21:21):
I see software strategies and digital strategies becoming so intertwined into the strategies of companies in general, whether you're an insurance company or a bank or anything. They're becoming so heavily entwined in the C-suite strategies. The first thing I would say, and where I see a lot of companies struggle with this is you have to make sure that it is thought of at the C-suite. What some organizations do is go, "Oh, no, that's IT work. Let me push all the software strategy down." If you're doing that, you're missing out on innovation, and this is where the product role comes in and where I think more organizations need chief product officers because they're the person in the C-suite saying, "How can software enable us to be 10 times better and crush our competition, whether we're a bank or insurance company or a pharmaceutical company? What can we do with our software that's going to put us ahead of the competition, that's going to put us ahead of the market?"

(01:22:16):
If you're not having those conversations when you're thinking of your long-term company strategy, you're behind, you're behind because that is what every small high-growth startup is doing that's coming out to try to disrupt these big companies. The big companies are successful, they have a lot of money so they don't have as much urgency as sometimes these smaller companies do to change or somebody who's failing to change. That's why things are going so slow, but at the same time, if we don't pay attention to that and we're not considering it, that's where the danger comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):
I imagine people are going to have a lot of questions and hope to get even more advice. A couple of final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to ask more questions along these lines, maybe get your help on some of this stuff? Then finally, how can listeners be useful to you, Melissa.

Melissa Perri (01:23:02):
You can find me on LinkedIn. If you go search for Melissa Perri with an I, P-E-R-R-I, you'll find me there. My LinkedIn is /melissajeanPerri. I'm happy to connect with people there. My school is called Product Institute, so if you're interested in doing product management training or getting help with some of this stuff, go to productinstitute.com and reach out to me. I run a podcast too called The Product Thinking Podcast. We answer questions every week, and a lot of them are around SAFe, agile and all these topics, so if you have a question and you're saying, "Hey, how do I do this?", definitely reach out and let me know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Awesome. Melissa, I learned a lot. I feel like a lot of people who listen to this podcast, they're like, "I had no idea about any of this, and now I understand all these terms that I kind of hear occasionally." Thank you for coming and sharing all of this with us, especially the advice for folks that are in this world right now.

Melissa Perri (01:23:49):
Yeah. Thanks for having me.

# The ultimate guide to product operations | Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles

## Transcript

Melissa Perri (00:00:00):
Do you want to hire 10,000 product managers and let them all do these things off the side of their desk and then concentrate on strategic work 30% of the time or do you want them concentrating on strategic work majority of the time and then help build a product operations team around them that can create these shared systems and this infrastructure to allow them to work better?

Lenny (00:00:25):
Today, my guests are Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles. This is a rare two-guest episode. Melissa and Denise are authors of an awesome new book called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. Melissa is a legend in the product management community. She's the author of the foundational handbook, Escaping the Build Trap. She runs a product management training organization called Produx Labs, teaches product management at Harvard, and has worked with hundreds of companies on their product management function. Denise is a product leader, coach, and consultant helping companies with their product vision, strategy, and execution, and works with Melissa at Produx Labs. 

(00:01:02):
In our conversation, we get super deep into the emerging role of product ops. As you'll hear in our conversation, over the past few years, this role has gone from almost non-existent to something like half of scaling tech companies with at least one product ops person. This new role is probably the thing that's most changing in the role of product management. After this conversation, I'm convinced it's a great thing. 

(00:01:24):
We chat about what the role concretely is, how it differs from product management and project management, what to look for in your first product ops hire, how to roll out a product ops function, why product managers shouldn't be afraid of this role and how your life gets significantly better, plus, a case study on how they rolled out product ops function at a large company, and so much more. With that, I bring you Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles after a short word from our sponsor.

(00:01:50):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets. Create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds, and it's all built on Jira, where your engineering team's already working so true collaboration is finally possible. 

(00:02:36):
Great products are built by great teams, not just engineers, sales, support, leadership, even Greg from finance. Anyone that you want can contribute ideas, feedback, and insights in Jira Product Discovery for free, no catch, and it's only $10 a month for you. Say goodbye to your spreadsheets and the never ending alignment efforts. The old way of doing product management is over. Rediscover what's possible with Jira Product Discovery.

(00:03:13):
Melissa and Denise, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Denise Tilles (00:03:17):
Thank you. 

Melissa Perri (00:03:18):
Thanks for having us.

Lenny (00:03:19):
You are the second ever guest duo I've had on the podcast. Melissa, this is your second appearance on the podcast, and you two have a new book out, which I have right here. It's called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. What I want to do with our time today is to help people fully understand the role of product operations from every direction as much as we can get through in an hour. How does that sound?

Melissa Perri (00:03:44):
Sounds great. 

Denise Tilles (00:03:44):
Great.

Melissa Perri (00:03:45):
Let's do it. 

Lenny (00:03:45):
Awesome. So first question, just to set a little context on this role, how popular and how common is the role at this point? I did a quick skim of just awesome companies and really successful companies, and every single one of them seems to have a product ops role at this point. OpenAI, Uber, Stripe, Ramp, Deal, those are just the few that I looked at. Is that what you're seeing? How should people think about how popular and how common this role has become?

Melissa Perri (00:04:12):
I think over the last few years, we definitely have seen product operations start booming. It did originate in a lot of big companies that you mentioned too like Uber. The head of product operations at Uber and the person who started it, Blake Samic, is a case study in our book and he also did it at Stripe and he does it at OpenAI. So it's pretty funny that you mentioned those three because that's Blake right there who did that. We have seen a very good transition from people whispering about product operations, and I know when I wrote my first book, Escaping the Build Trap, in 2018 I mentioned it in there because we had just started doing it at Athenahealth. 

(00:04:49):
I saw this as a really big issue in trying to make a complete product management function there and especially at scale. We had 365 product teams. We were trying to figure out how does this all come together, and product operations for me was a key part of it. So when I had first written it into that book, a lot of people were like, "Oh, what is this thing? I think we need it. Do we need more?" and that's what got us to start writing this book. Since then, I've seen a lot more companies coming out and either making more mature product operations teams that started probably before that or actually introducing them now.

Lenny (00:05:21):
I guess maybe thinking about just tech companies, if you had to put a number on some rough percentage of interesting fast-growing, hyper growth, these startups, is there a percentage you'd put on how many of them have a product ops person at this point?

Melissa Perri (00:05:34):
We don't have a hard and fast number, I'll say that on this, but we have seen that. Let's take a sampling of maybe something that I know better. When I teach CPO accelerator, when I teach people in these cohorts, out of the 20, 25 people that we'll have in a cohort, I'd say at least half of them have somebody doing something product ops related. It might not be a mature function, it might just be one person on it, but at least half of them have somebody doing something.

Denise Tilles (00:06:06):
That's a good yardstick because I teach a product operations masterclass for Produx Labs with Melissa, and it's been interesting. I do some pre-work and try to understand where folks are in the products journey. When we started offering this class in 2020, about 60% were products curious. As time has gone on, it's really gone down and people have started to add it. They just want to understand what's the best way to optimize it. So I would say it's gone from that level to, say, probably 60% of them do have it now and then want to understand how to optimize it.

Lenny (00:06:41):
Do you have a sense of when this started to inflect and become such a common thing? When I was a product manager, I had no product ops person. So it's really fascinating to me to learn about this emergence. I know there's probably not a date, but just it sounds like maybe after your last book was published. Is there a timeframe of this became a thing? Is it this guy you mentioned that's now at OpenAI that started spreading it? 

Melissa Perri (00:07:01):
Blake, I think, was one of the people at the beginning who was talking about it the most and he's done a lot of work, I think, to push product operations and tell people about it. So that was great. I know Pendo has been speaking about product ops a little bit more and that's where I started to notice that it was picking up steam. I think around 2019 is when Pendo started talking about product operations. So it was roughly right after my book came out that I saw more people speaking about it and now they're trying to figure out, "Do we standardize it? What do we need? How does this actually look like in organizations?" but I think it's been probably a good five years of now hearing people doing it in realtime.

Lenny (00:07:41):
Awesome, and it sounds like maybe just in the last few years it started to really take off. We actually had Christine from Pendo on the podcast talking about product ops about a year ago at this point. So this is a great followup to a lot of that. Before we talk about what is product ops and what are the functions, what would you say are the biggest benefits to a company having a product ops role and also just what's a sign that you should probably seriously consider bringing on a product ops person and starting to invest in that area?

Denise Tilles (00:08:08):
It's really about helping the product managers focus on what they were actually hired for, the strategic work. In my role on the operating side and managing teams and Melissa as well, more and more product managers are taking on the data, harvesting the data, implementation and just to get data to work with, they're spending 20%, 30% of their time. So what would that look like if they were enabled and had all of those great inputs to actually focus on company growth, achieving the value, achieving the scaling goals that the company had? So it's really about helping them focus on what they were hired for.

Lenny (00:08:48):
Again, when I was a PM, I had no product ops person, and having read your book, basically all the things product ops does is stuff PMs historically have done. To me, it's scary to give up all those things and put them on someone else's plate. There's the ideal of, "Oh, amazing, I don't have to do all these things. I'll focus on things I really get excited about," but there's also this new fear of, "Oh, someone else is going to take these things and maybe they won't do as well. There's this new process I have to think about. There's new lines of communication." So what's your biggest pitch to a product manager starting to hear about product ops and this fear of like, "Oh, man, my job is going to be weird. This new person I have to deal with all the time. I used to do all these things." How do you help a PM get excited about this?

Melissa Perri (00:09:30):
Product operations does not take away decision making rights from the product manager. It's there to inform them. So if you're judging your success as a product manager of, "Hey, I do the SQL queries and I have to spend the 50 hours to set up all these customer interviews and calls," that to me is very operational process type work, but it's not work that's going to help you make a decision about your product. That's why we're looking at the product operations team because what I've seen is product managers doing this off the side of their desk like me too. I got excited about this because when I was at OpenSky in early days of my product management career, I had to go learn MongoDB to get data out of a database. I was sitting through a MongoDB class learning how to do this. I knew SQL, but we did not use the SQL database then. I had to go learn MongoDB so I would stop bothering the engineers to be able to actually just measure if my products and my features were doing anything correct. 

(00:10:27):
That was a lot of time that I spent doing that instead of spending it on good feature work and on understanding my customers and working with my developers and figuring out what we were actually going to build, instead I'm out here learning this programming language, which I never used again, by the way. Never used it again after that. That to me is the stuff that product ops takes away from the product managers. 

(00:10:51):
What I constantly hear from product managers though is, "I am so busy, I don't have time to do the things that I need to do correctly. I'm so busy trying to line up customer interviews," or, "I'm so busy just trying to get data out of systems. I'm fighting these fights to get the things that I need to do my job correctly that I don't have time to do my job correctly," and that's what we're trying to help them with. So I wouldn't be afraid that product ops is coming in here. It's not supposed to be something that's providing more overhead. It's supposed to be something that's a little more liberating and helps free you up from all the busy work.

Lenny (00:11:26):
That's a great pitch. I always thought product management is an insane role with way too much going on, and that's why everyone's always burnt out and stressed. There's just so many things you have to do. So I totally get how this is happening and why this is happening. I love that you're helping people figure out how to actually do it well. Let's actually get into what the role actually is. I think it's a really confusing role. A lot of people hear product ops and everyone know what it is. There's maybe research synthesis, there's some data stuff. What's the simplest way to think about what is the general consistent roles of a product ops person and what they can do for your company?

Denise Tilles (00:12:03):
The way we think about it is structured around the three pillars that we talk about in the book, so business and data insights, more of the quantitative side, making sure that the product manager has all of these engagement and revenue inputs to make smart decisions, the customer market insights, so the qualitative. We talked about this a little bit earlier in terms of finding folks to speak to, making sure you're speaking to more than one just customer. Finally, the third pillar is process and practices. So it's really around those areas and it depends on what your company needs and where the biggest opportunities and challenges might be.

Lenny (00:12:43):
Awesome. So the three, just to reshare what you just said, the three pillars of product ops, business, data and insights, customer and market insights and the process of how you build product and helping the business operate more effectively in the way they build product.

Denise Tilles (00:13:00):
Sounds great when you say it. Yes.

Lenny (00:13:03):
I have the notes and this is exactly described in your book, so well-described. Is there one of these three that you find most important, impactful? Is it really dependent on the business and their needs or what the PM wants to do? How do you think about, I don't know, which of these three is maybe most important or is it a super dependent?

Melissa Perri (00:13:20):
So we usually see that high growth companies start with business data and insights and make sure that they can actually monitor what they're doing and get the strategic inputs. We see larger companies and enterprises go more towards the process and governance, especially if they're in, let's say, a transformation because they don't have the infrastructure to run good product. Let's say it's that way. They're usually just starting out, they're just forming their teams. Let's say they just trained product managers and now they're like, "What else do we need to do besides just training product managers to make this work?" So they need an operating model and they typically don't have a product operating model. 

(00:13:58):
In that case, they're looking at even just, "How do we do roadmaps across the organization so that I as a chief product officer or VP of product can actually just have transparency into what my teams are doing?" Jira does not work for that. You need a portfolio tool to be able to roll that up into something that makes sense. Again, that helps me as a VP now or a CPO make strategic decisions and it helps me monitor my teams and understand, "Are we actually spending money on the right things? Are we doing the right work?" So they tend to do it more on the process and governance side, but it's all in service of being able to make rapid strategic decisions and get good products out there to the world.

Lenny (00:14:40):
That's a really handy way of thinking about it. So just to say what you said again, for high growth companies, you're finding of these three pillars generally where product ops can help most is the business and data insights, helping them understand what's happening and make decisions more quickly, which makes a lot of sense. For more established older companies going through a digital transformation, oftentimes it's helping them with their process and making them more efficient in how they operate. Is there also a bucket for the middle pillar of customer and market insights or is that spread across?

Denise Tilles (00:15:11):
That's the squishy middle. When I do teach this class, I ask people what their perception is of product ops and people never think that. So that's an area definitely for growth I think at a lot of companies.

Lenny (00:15:26):
How does that piece work with user research and that team?

Melissa Perri (00:15:30):
So we've seen a lot of the work that is done in that team. They work with user research. Now, in organizations where let's say, this happens in a lot of organizations but not all of them, where product oversees design as well and user research and it oversees UX, this becomes seamless because you are going to have, let's say, a product ops person usually with a user research background who's going to be helping to do the stuff we talk about and the customer market insights piece, which is pulling all the research that's been done, like the customer interviews, all those things together into things like a findings database. So there's great tools out there like Dovetail, but you can also roll your own, and it's about aggregating all the interviews or customer research that's been done so people can query it and start to see what do we already know so we're not going out there and duplicating a bunch of research.

(00:16:22):
It's also about finding participants who want to opt into research. So making sure that you have customers aware that, "Hey, we might contact you to do customer interviews. This is why. Do you want to participate in alphas and betas? If so, this is what it entails." If we can build a database of people and customers that we have who opt into those types of things, it makes it easier for product managers to go out and contact them and say, "Hey, by the way, we got a beta. Do you want to do it?" They know what it is, they're expecting it. They know what the cadence is that people will reach out to them on to do research, and the user researchers can use that as well. 

(00:16:58):
Now, the thing about the customer and market insights piece is that that person who's streamlining those activities and building those systems, they're not usually the same person who's doing the user research. So this is not about taking user research away from product managers or from user researchers, it's about enabling them to do it more effectively, enabling the insights to be put out across the company more effectively, and also helping them get in touch with users and get that feedback. 

(00:17:30):
Another piece of this too that we talk about is getting qualitative insights from sales and support. So we always hear from sales teams, and this is the classic product management tension, "The product managers aren't listening to me" or, "I've told them five months ago that I had this problem with these customers that were going to churn." We didn't build those features. What this function does with the customer and market insights here is that it helps get a lot of that information back to the product team in an effective way. 

(00:18:00):
Then it also helps communicate back to sales, "Hey, let's be a little transparent about how we're using that feedback." So that's how we can communicate it back in strategy. Let them know where we stand with working on those ideas or solving those problems for customers, but usually, there's a wealth of qualitative information stuck somewhere in our organization systems, whether it's in Salesforce, whether it's in support tickets, in somebody's Google doc of their customer interviews that they've been doing, and what we're trying to do is get that out of these individual systems and into somewhere where a lot of people can take those qualitative insights and start to learn from them.

Lenny (00:18:36):
People always ask me, "What's changing in product management? What's the future of product management?" I'm always like, "Nothing. It's going to be basically the same. It's just never going to be fully defined. It's going to keep doing this weird role," but I feel like this is actually the answer. What's changing in product management is this product ops role is emerging, taking a lot of these things that PMs don't necessarily want to be doing or aren't amazing at and giving you more space to do the things they really want to do. So I think that's pretty amazing. I think if you think about the timeline, you said five years ago there was no real product ops. Today, half of companies essentially have a product ops role and I'm guessing in another few years it'll be much higher. So this is really interesting.

Melissa Perri (00:19:12):
I'm excited about it too. I think what we saw before was that, like you were saying, product management was this squishy role for a long time, but now we're standardizing what do product managers do. What's happening, I think, though is product managers become more prevalent, and as people realize that this is a critical role for companies, whether you're a software company or a bank or something else. We build businesses off of software in today's world and if you're not building software, you are behind. With more and more software that we're putting out there, product managers don't have time to go do all these things off the side of their desk and it's fine when you're a small startup. I was doing it too. Like I said, I had to go learn MongoDB when I was in a smaller company, and then we start to scale and I've got more and more product responsibility and I'm like, "I don't have time to go learn MongoDB now," and that's where people start to burn out and where they get frustrated, like you said.

(00:20:09):
We've got more and more systems, we've got more software tools out there that product managers are using, and it becomes a lot to track. So it's either, for companies, do you want to hire 10,000 product managers and let them all do these things off the side of their desk and then concentrate on strategic work 30% of the time or do you want them concentrating on strategic work majority of the time and then help build a product operations team around them that can create these shared systems and this infrastructure to allow them to work better?

Lenny (00:20:39):
I think that's such a powerful way of thinking about this. I imagine PMs listening to you saying, "I don't have to learn MongoDB and SQL anymore," would think. Actually, no, I think that's good. They should learn to do SQL and run their own data, but I think the important pieces here, yes, it would be great, but as you scale, it becomes harder and harder to have time to do all that because things ... You end up with other work that you need to be doing. So in theory, it would be awesome if your PMs could run their own queries and do their own research and create the whole process, but it just becomes harder and harder. 

(00:21:12):
It reminds me of a lot of companies that are trying to delay hiring a product manager in general and instead giving the role to engineers and designers. My feedback is always like, "That's great as long as they want to be doing all these things that are not generally what they enjoy doing," like an engineer doesn't necessarily love running meetings and writing one pagers and strategy docs and taking notes. So I think it's a similar thing where, sure, it's great until you don't really want to be doing that or you don't have time for that and you have your actual job you need to be doing.

Denise Tilles (00:21:41):
That's your full-time job and your OKRs and your goals are really around the outcomes for the company, you're like, "But I wrote 20 scripts this year." So we need to help them focus on the things that they're being expected to deliver in terms of value.

Melissa Perri (00:21:56):
I also think it's funny how many people want to be a product manager until they realize what product management entails. This happens a lot and I saw it with my MBA students at Harvard too. We do a whole class, they play a product manager. I had a lot of people opt out of being a product manager at the end of it. They were like, "I did not realize it was like that. I did not realize I had to do so many things." I think a lot of what gets them as well is the type of context switching that's required as a product manager. So you already, just with the basis of what we have to do, do so many different things of user research, working with the designers, working with the developers, working with executives, working with different stakeholders. You got to context switch to be able to relate to all them. You got to empathize with all these different people. You have to do all these different tasks to do this type of work. 

(00:22:46):
Then you got to go figure out what template to put your roadmap in, which is going to be different template than the other 80 product managers on your team because somebody didn't come in and just say, "Hey, we're going to use this." That type of work to me is just distracting from it. Is it hard for a product leader to just be like, "Hey, this is a template we're using"? No, but then if that product leader has to go out and train 80 other people on that template, make sure it's consistently updated all the time, make sure it's in the right formats, make sure it's in the right software, that is where the overhead comes in, and a lot of product leaders are doing this right now and what we're trying to do is free up individual product managers, but also those product leaders.

(00:23:33):
So I work with all these CPOs, these VPs of product and they're like ... I see them just not working on strategy. I'm like, "Why are you not working on strategy?" and they're like, "I don't have time to do that. I'm in here stopping all these fires. I'm figuring out what template I should put my roadmap in." Like I said, it's not hard. They know what template it should be in, but think about if you now can delegate that to somebody else and say, "I want it in this template. Go roll it out. Go roll it out, go train everybody on it, find the right software for it, do it." It frees those people up, the leaders, to go work on strategy. That's why you're spending so much money for a product leader, anyway. That's why you spend so much money for a product manager, anyway. So to me, these things are not impossible to do. It's just do we have the right people doing them?

Lenny (00:24:23):
For PMs that are trying to figure out what remains on their plate, what are the the pieces that a PM should keep and not offload on a product ops person?

Melissa Perri (00:24:33):
They don't want to offload decision rights. You should never be outsourcing your decision making to a product ops person. That's not the point. They're the product manager for the product managers. That's how I think about it. So their decision should be around, "How do I operationalize great product management here?" but as a product manager, you shouldn't be delegating to them to make any decisions about their product, and that's not their job. If they are coming to you and saying, "You should build this," that's not their job either. That's not the right thing. 

(00:25:03):
So making the actual decision and then putting that decision into play with your teams, that's the type of work that you want to hold onto for a product manager. So while a product ops person can help you point you in the right direction, let's say, to find customers, maybe even help you get in touch with the customers, send out the email to invite them to a meeting or operationalize that, hopefully that's automated. I would love a product ops person to automate that type of stuff. You are going to be doing the user research. The product ops person you can go to and maybe say, "Hey, this is the type of problems that we're understanding," and maybe they help you find other pieces of information around the organization on those topics and bring it to you, but they're not going to be the ones reading through all this information and being like, "You should build this." 

(00:25:49):
They're also not going to be the ones who you say, "Hey, I made this decision about what to build, told the team about it, the team got together. Can you go monitor the developers and make sure they're building it on time?" No, they're not project managers, they're not the people who are going to be on top of your developers watching them build things, making sure that everything's out on time. That's not their role either. They're not going to handle hard stakeholder conversations about trade-offs for you, all of those things that you are going to want to keep ownership of because at the end of the day as a product manager, your job is to produce outcomes and you do need to make sure that you're monitoring those outcomes and moving towards them. You don't want to offload their responsibility.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So I took a couple notes of just things that the PM continues to own, whatever, in quotes, no one owns anything, strategy, vision, prioritizing, resource allocation, trade-off decisions, hard conversations around trade-offs and stakeholder input and things like that. Is there anything else in that bucket of just stuff a PM, a product manager continues to be responsible for?

Denise Tilles (00:26:55):
Well, there's a big piece that we're missing, go-to-market, and that's where product ops could really make a difference in terms of connecting those teams, but also being the first point of contact for sales, first point of contact for product, and enabling just some efficiencies if we want to call it process or method, but just trying to help break down the silos. 

(00:27:19):
A company I'm working with right now, there's big challenge with that and it's a large enterprise level company. So how do we break down all of the different silos between departments and team leads and whatnot? So it's really talking about, "Here's how we're going to do it. Here's some simple templates we will use at training sales, training product," and then getting that into play. Doing the book and doing our research, that was a consistent story point from a lot of people that we interviewed that go-to-market was a really big pain point.

Melissa Perri (00:27:50):
So I think too what Denise was saying is product ops will take on a lot of the coordination of those types of things and making the standardized templates, but as a product manager, your role in informing what the go-to-market is doesn't change. You're still putting the inputs in there. So maybe product ops will provide, for example, templates and help say, "Hey, here's the different pieces that we need to make a go-to-market plan," for example, "Here's the templates. Here's what I gathered from people," but you as a product manager still have to fill out your parts. 

(00:28:21):
You still have to go talk to the salespeople. You still have to work with the marketing people to make sure it's positioned correctly, but the product ops person can help with the program management around it of getting those people together, having consistent templates, creating the cadence for when you review those things, making sure that they all align and they're all in one place so you're not going to find them everywhere, and then making sure that go-to-market process is consistent across the organization so that it's not like, as Denise said, it's not like everybody's reinventing the wheel and somebody on a go-to-market team has to figure out how to go-to-market differently with a different product team.

Lenny (00:28:57):
Awesome. That's a really handy and important addition. You mentioned project management. I imagine many people think product ops also takes on project management. What's a good way to think about project management versus product ops? There's also program management. Do you have a way of thinking about those roles?

Denise Tilles (00:29:15):
The way I like to think about it is, however, whatever they're doing in terms of the three pillars of product ops is really thinking about, as I mentioned earlier, increasing the speed and quality of decision making and all of the pillars of play into that. Program manager, I think, is really thinking about larger company initiatives and the duration of their work is ongoing versus a project manager, they're responsible for certain project that's at a time box and an end date, but it does get a little wiffy, for sure.

Lenny (00:29:43):
I want to go back to the three pillars real quick and go one level deeper to help people understand what they actually entail and what are the jobs of a product ops person. So just we could even keep this brief, but just let's say with business data and insights, what are the functions and jobs and things that a product ops person would be doing for your company?

Denise Tilles (00:30:02):
A lot of companies will have a data science team or a business intelligence team and you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you don't have to have your internal product ops type of intelligence team, but it's about connecting those and making sure you're putting that with a product lens, and especially, say, with finance too. You don't want all the product managers hitting up the CFO for that month's revenue or having questions. So it's about accessing all of these inputs and putting it through a product lens and then making sure that product managers actually know what to do with it, can action it.

Lenny (00:30:36):
So it's essentially running queries for you, generating charts and graphs and recommendations based on what the data's telling you. Basically, it's doing all the data stuff that a PM would be doing. Is there anything else there?

Melissa Perri (00:30:51):
Also helping the leaders too. So we're talking about it from a product management perspective, but I think this one especially becomes really critical for leaders and executives. A lot of times, and I sit through board meetings where we talk about ARR, we talk about retention, we talk about net retention, and we talk about all of these business metrics, and they're great for monitoring the health of our business, but where product ops comes into play in business data and insights is how do we monitor the health of our product.

(00:31:22):
So as a chief product officer, ARR is interesting to me, but it's not as interesting to me as ARR by customer segment. It's not as interesting as ARR by product line. It's not as interesting if I take that and then look at it by retention or adoption by product or feature set or adoption by customer segment by product. When we start to put those lenses on it, they now become a really powerful strategy insight. 

(00:31:49):
So what I think these people do and do really well is even at the executive level, they help you ... You as a product leader are like, "I need these types of insights. This helps me. This is how our business runs and this is how I want to set the strategy." These people make those dashboards, make those repeatable insights for you. Then ideally, they know the data so well and they know your business so well that they can surface up other opportunities for you as well to look at data that you didn't know was there or can find these interesting trends.

(00:32:18):
So they are very much like the people digging into the data, they're just doing it with more of a product lens instead of, like Denise said, an overall company metric lens. It's not just in service of the product managers. I just wanted to point that out because I think this becomes so powerful for leaders because if leaders don't understand those types of metrics, they can't actually monitor their strategies. They can't go back and say, "Oh, we decided to go upmarket into the enterprise." Look, we've got enterprise revenue, but are you actually looking at where the enterprises are adopting different product lines? Are you looking at how the enterprise uses different features, and if certain enterprises are using these types of features, are they less likely to churn? It's those types of insights that I think are really important on this lens.

Lenny (00:33:09):
As a PM hearing that somebody else will be doing this, it feels really weird. This feels like such a core job of a PM is to spend a lot of time with data, try to find opportunities, try to find things going well, not going well, but I think the message, again, is not you shouldn't be doing that as a PM and it's not bad if you are really good at it, it's you probably just don't have a lot of time to do it well. If you can find someone that's really good at this and has time, that doesn't have all the other thousands of things on their plate, you'll actually end up finding more interesting results, finding more interesting insights. You're probably missing a bunch of stuff because you don't actually have a lot of time. Is that generally the way you think about it?

Melissa Perri (00:33:45):
Yeah, and I think too, the business and data insights people, they're not going to be experts on product. They're almost always not. We had a couple analysts at Produx Labs and they were ex-McKinsey, ex-Deloitte. They didn't know anything about product. So we taught them the product piece and we were the ones who were like, "Here's the interesting data I know I'm going to need to see," and they were able to pull those things together in views where we could actually dig into it, but that was a jumping off point on the quantitative research where we're like, "Okay. Now we need to go do the qualitative." 

(00:34:18):
I think for product managers, you still need to be super comfortable with data. If you can't read these charts, if you can't see or understand trends, and a lot of times too, if you're putting this stuff in Looker or a BI tool, ideally, you can pull ad hoc reports yourself. It's just that you don't have to craft a SQL query to do it. You still need to understand the relationship between data and product and you still need to understand what good data looks like. You need to understand too things like causation and correlation. You need to understand that, "If I put out this crazy marketing launch on Thursday, that's why all of a sudden we got a million signups on Thursday and we didn't get a million signups on Wednesday." They still need to understand all those things, and I don't think that becomes any less important. I don't think understanding and interpreting trends becomes any less important as a product manager's job. I just think it's about putting data into the hands of product faster so that it's not about you having to fight your way through bureaucratic processes at your company to get that data.

(00:35:21):
So product ops can help streamline things that we know we're going to look at repeatedly. There's a bunch of stuff that we know we should look at. So put them in a dashboard like, "Why should I have to go pull that report ad hoc every single time?" Put them in a dashboard, put them in a report. Same for board slides. We had one of my friends who's the chief product officer of Forsta, Brian Bhuta, and he said, "I love product ops because when we prepare for board meetings, I know there's a certain set of information that I'm going to have to put together for this board meeting, and then when we go do it manually, it becomes obsolete by the time the board meeting's over and then I got to start again and prepare for the next three months and do the board meeting again." So it's like you don't want your data to be obsolete. You want this to be in a repeatable fashion for things that you know are repeatable, but it doesn't get you off the hook of still looking for trends and looking for insights.

Lenny (00:36:17):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

(00:37:38):
We had a guest on, Casey Winters, and he has this perspective that when you have ops, operational people, that's generally a sign that something is not efficient and it could be made more efficient with software and product. Not everything can be productized, but do you have a perspective on that, that ops is often a sign where software, hopefully someday, could do itself?

Melissa Perri (00:38:02):
You still need people to oversee those programs. So I don't think they would fully be obsolete. It wouldn't be like this whole role goes away completely, but they're the people who should be looking at, "What can we do to optimize and streamline this?" and not do it with human components. I think that's why a product management mindset lands so well to a product ops function too because you're like, "How do I use software or tools or processes or frameworks to help fill in some of these gaps and standardize it and then let it run?" That what I was meaning by the shared services model. 

(00:38:32):
If you really think in that format, it's not like, "Hey, I need a team of 10,000 product ops people." I think you're doing it wrong if you're doing that right. It should be a well-run lean team who thinks about how to leverage tools for this or building your own or whatever and your products for the product team, and that's how it should be seen. So what I mean it shouldn't be obsolete one day, if you are building, let's say, products for the product team, you still need somebody to look over that product and make sure it's relevant. At the pace of everything changing like it does today, so many things are so different than they were five years ago, you want somebody to be looking over that and making sure they're still up-to-date, it's still relevant, it still works for our company and stuff like that, but you're going to have a smaller subset of people doing that. It's not going to be like, "Oh, I need a product ops team for every product manager that's on here." That's not how it should work at all.

Lenny (00:39:27):
I think that is going to make a lot of people feel better hearing that. Do you have any rule of thumb or way of thinking about just how many product ops people you want per product manager, per team? What's a simple heuristic for just how many people you may need?

Melissa Perri (00:39:43):
I don't have a hard and fast rule on that one, but I would say if you are at a one-to-one ratio, you're doing it wrong. Absolutely. 

Denise Tilles (00:39:47):
If you're at one-to-hundred, you're doing it wrong. 

Melissa Perri (00:39:54):
Yeah, too. I also think it's like ... So when we talked about it too with this hybrid versus shared services model, if you have a hybrid model, let's say, and typically, this is a symptom that your data is not well-instrumented. Let me put it that way as well. Sometimes you need a stopgap holdover until you can well-instrument your data or something, and that could be as long as it takes for certain companies. In this case, like we said, you might have a business data and insights person aligned to every director of product who oversees multiple Scrum teams. You might have one aligned to every VP of product, depending on how much help you need to get the product data out of things.

(00:40:37):
Now, if you have a very well-instrumented dataset like we were talking about at Doodle or something like that, you're probably going to have way less people because the product managers are armed and capable of going in there and being able to pull the queries themselves, do their ad hoc research themselves because they made it accessible and you made it possible for them to go do that. 

(00:40:59):
So I do think there's a balance there between how good your company is instrumented both for everything, for all three of these pieces that we're talking about relative to the size of your product ops team. It might take some more manpower at the beginning to get it going, but, ideally, you streamline this team and it becomes pretty lean and pretty small and they're overseeing multiple programs or software systems that run themselves.

Lenny (00:41:25):
Well, it gives me a lot of hope that this isn't going to become just another massive org within a company. It is looking at companies that are incredibly efficient like Ramp and Deal that have very few employees, very few product managers, and they have product ops people. So that tells me there's a lot of leverage that you can find from just maybe, I don't know, one or two that's probably not a large team of product ops people there.

Melissa Perri (00:41:48):
We say too, get started with one person. We described these three pillars and repeatedly through the book we're like, "Hone in on what's the most important part for you that's going to help you right now," that we talk through, and then just take one person and throw that out there. Usually, you can get so much leverage from that that it frees you up to do a lot of the stuff that you need to get done. Then when you're ready and you see the next hurdle and it's not something that first person can take on, then you might add one more person.

(00:42:18):
There are different expertise, I think, between the three different pillars and the people who would oversee it, and that's something to take into account as well. So like we said, in business data and insights, that person typically is not an expert on product. Hopefully they get ramped up on it working with you, but they're typically not an expert on product. A lot of times these people are not coming from a product management background. That's going to be actually a different person than I would look at to help with the governance and product pieces. That person needs to be a product background person because they're usually helping roll out the roadmap stuff, coach people on how to do it, helping to define the different systems and processes that you need on your product operating model, and if they have no experience with product management at all, that's going to be really hard for them to do and it's probably not going to be great. 

(00:43:05):
We do see this trend of people throwing agile coaches at this, and agile coaches who have never been a product manager before in a well-run company are going to struggle there because they're going to revert back to agile processes and optimizing for things like Scrum, but they're not going to do what that role is designed for, which is to help product management processes. We don't usually need another agile coach telling us how to run a standup. We need people to come in and help us figure out who's invited to these cross-functional roadmap reviews, what inputs do we need on there, and what decisions do we need to make coming out of it, and how do we communicate it at the correct level to executives as well so we're not digging into Jira at these meetings in front of A CEO. CEOs don't care about what's in Jira. Well, they shouldn't. Let's put it that way. 

Denise Tilles (00:43:57):
Shouldn't.

Melissa Perri (00:43:59):
They want to know like, "What are the big pushes that we're doing to help us reach our strategic objectives?" So it's helping that they know a little more about the right size of communication, the different cross-functional teams, what product managers do on a daily basis and what's important to them, and that's really critical in that role. So that's where, I think, your teams might just be slightly bigger from a perspective of more than one person. I'm not saying hundreds of people, but you might need a couple different people in this organization because the roles are slightly different. For the market research and the customer research thing too, you might need somebody with a user research background for that. Somebody who did research ops is a great person for that.

Denise Tilles (00:44:41):
It's pretty unusual, I think, to see companies start out with an entire team. I worked with Sam's Club and they were planning to do it that way, but mostly we see it starting organically. I think the way [inaudible 00:44:53] mentioned in her story of being a PM and feeling the pain and having the empathy of wanting to make it better, and that's typically the generation of these roles, that it might be someone being allocated part-time from their PM role and finding out that they really do enjoy this enablement aspect of it and that's where it grows.

Lenny (00:45:12):
Awesome. So let's just lean into this topic of just how to start rolling it out at your company, and you've already talked about a bunch of tips there. By the way, if you buy your book at the end there, there's this really beautiful little guy, there you go, I think, on the camera of just a little yellow brick road of all the steps that it takes to roll it out. 

Denise Tilles (00:45:12):
Yes, Candyland.

Lenny (00:45:32):
Candyland. So on this topic of just who to start with, sounds like you recommend start with one person, and what I'm hearing is pick one of these three pillars that you think is most highest leverage potentially to take off your product management plate. Is that right?

Denise Tilles (00:45:46):
Yup.

Lenny (00:45:49):
So what else should people be thinking about in starting to roll this role out, starting to build this team?

Denise Tilles (00:45:56):
That's a great question. So one of our case studies is Shintaro Matsui at Amplitude, and he created the role at Amplitude. When you think about, it's Meta. So they're creating a tool that helps in terms of product operations, but they're enabling it there as well. So he's done a really great job of getting that set up and really being a thought leader there. So the case study that we chatted with him about was introducing it and how do you get it going and how do you build the momentum and show the quick wins. That was his top tip was making sure that you set, understand, first of all, you may have a perception of what the biggest needs are, but doing your listening tour and doing your user research, some research sprints, understanding there may be a huge opportunity, but it also sounds massive in your team of one, where can you make the most difference quickly? Where can you have the most impact? 

(00:46:46):
So identifying those, celebrating those wins, making sure everybody understands that, and then showing what's above the line with a person of one the capabilities you'll have, and then below the line, things that you may not get but you could if we did think about building the team and setting the expectations as well.

Lenny (00:47:04):
Do you suggest they try to hire someone that has already been a product ops person? Is it okay to hire someone that hasn't then they just become a product ops person? How important is that experience?

Denise Tilles (00:47:14):
I think if you find someone that's done the role of product management, awesome. If someone's set it up somewhere ... Look at Blake Samic, started from Uber to Strike to AI. Clearly, he's got a model going that's really successful. So if somebody could get a Blake Samic, I would say definitely do that.

Lenny (00:47:32):
It'd be hard to pull him away from OpenAI. 

Melissa Perri (00:47:37):
I don't think he's leaving there right now. Just started, got a lot of work ahead of him.

Lenny (00:47:42):
We have a lot of LinkedIn requests right now. Here they come.

Melissa Perri (00:47:46):
Poor Blake. Sorry, sorry for your inbox. I think too it's about if you're going all in. If you're just trying to get buy-in for this and let's say it's originating from a CPO or a product leader who's like, "Hey, let's start this out," but the company's not ready to invest all the way, you might pull somebody from a different function, let's say, have them be the product ops person and try to rapidly demonstrate value. If you're a CPO or a leader and you're like, "I got budget. I know this is important. I'm totally bought in. Let's go," you're probably better off hiring, let's say, somebody who's done this before, somebody who's experienced, but also somebody who could be more of a VP or director of product ops and then they can go do the hiring and figuring out, "Do we pull people from other functions and streamline it?" That helps free up the leader as well from not having to go find 8,000. It's never going to be 8,000 people, but eight people to do that function.

(00:48:43):
So that would be a way to look at it as well. So if people are not quite sold on it, you might want to start with one function. Figure out where the burning issue is. Demonstrate that value. Show that it's something that you want to actually invest in, and then you might want to hire in a leader or help build up the team from there.

Lenny (00:49:00):
It feels like that first hire is so important because if they don't do great, the whole role of product ops starts to get a bad tinge within the company. So there's a lot of pressure on making sure that first person succeeds. I guess more reason to buy your book and make sure that they do it right. 

Melissa Perri (00:49:17):
If you feel like you as a leader can coach the product ops person and you have time to coach the product ops person, let's say, through being a good product ops person and getting started with it and directing them, you're probably good at taking somebody who does not have experience but has the right skillset and then you can teach them. If you have absolutely no time to coach this person and they're not super self-directed, let's say, so they're not going out taking classes, reading the books, doing that type of thing, probably going to want to hire somebody who's done it before, at least that portion of it, and then that person can help coach other people grow the function. 

(00:49:55):
It's the same thing with product management. We look at these teams especially in a lot of transformation companies. We have a lot of product managers who've never been product managers before, and a lot of leaders who've never been product managers before, and they ask me, "Do I hire in experienced leaders or what?" and I'm like, "Well, if those product leaders need to go coach other product managers, then you need somebody who's experienced in there. You need somebody who knows how to get that work done. If they don't have time to learn, if you're not on a timeline to actually teach these people these things and get them up to speed, then you need somebody to hit the ground running." 

(00:50:29):
So I'd look at it for how much time do we have to demonstrate value, how much coaching is available to get this person into the right mindset and the right skillset to do this and execute. I think that that's needed in almost every role, not just this one.

Denise Tilles (00:50:43):
One thing I wanted to mention was whether to hire products or product manager person for the role with the background of product ops or product management, there's not a ton of folks out there that have a products title, but as you're looking, dig in because this person may have been doing a lot of the work as a product manager or within that title. So there's a lot of people out there that probably would fit that profile, but not with a proper product ops title.

Lenny (00:51:10):
What are the key skills that you find are really important for finding this person, especially if they don't have this role? My guess is dependent on the pillar, if they're data-focused, research-focused or process-focused. What do you suggest to make sure you're looking for when you're hiring this person?

Melissa Perri (00:51:25):
With the business data and insights, you're looking for somebody who's really good at interpreting data, telling stories with data, somebody who's good at communicating to many different types of stakeholders about the data and putting it into useful ways. What I wouldn't hire for that role as a first person is it's not a database engineer. That's not what we're doing. We're not SQL-ing, turning things into the right SQL tables. We're instead trying to get the information out of the SQL tables and make sense out of it. 

(00:51:59):
So we actually find people with consultant backgrounds who are really good at this because they're usually churning out these types of reports and stuff for PE firms, VC firms, and whoever were their clients to begin with. What would be ideal is if that person has a lot of experience with a BI tool like Looker or Tableau as well and they could use it. That's not always the case. Sometimes those people are really good at Excel and PowerPoint, but they're not great at the Looker and BI. If you could find that two things together though, home run right there. 

(00:52:31):
So this person's probably a data analyst background. We did have a business intelligence background like you were talking about as well, something like that for the business and data and insights role. It does not have to be a product manager. I think you can help them, steer them in the right directions for what questions you need to answer. They shouldn't be the ones coming up with all the questions you need to answer. It'd be great if they surface some insights, but you ask them the questions, they can go get the answers.

Lenny (00:53:01):
What about for the other two pillars?

Denise Tilles (00:53:02):
Well, in terms of the process and practices, I think this person really needs a super high EQ, understanding what the needs are, but also has a good spidey sense of how much methods do we need to think about bringing to the team and thinking about how those things get introduced that it's not a mandate, but it's a suggestion of how we can work. Typically, product managers will be pretty open to that because if they're like, "I don't know what the roadmap template is. I don't know what the roadmap cadence is." "Here's some guidance." "Awesome. Now I don't have to think about how to do it, I'm just going to do it." 

(00:53:38):
So I think someone who has a lot of experience understanding the underlying tensions and opportunities, and then feels good and understands how to implement the systems thinking and also understands it's not a set it and forget it, that they're constantly reevaluating the processes, the tools, "Are these working for us?" Then understands, I think, in more broadly, "As my CPO is getting ready for a board meeting, what are the inputs they're going to need? As we're getting ready for the QBR, are the PMs ready? Do we have a cohesive stories? Anybody taking the time to look at all of the different presentations to make sure that we're giving the same perspective or building towards a certain strategy that everybody's focused on?" So that would be my advice.

Melissa Perri (00:54:30):
I think for customer and market research part, you're looking for somebody with more of a user research background here, but process-oriented. So I'd look for somebody who knows user research code, knows really good tactics for that because it can help create the toolkits, get the right type of prototyping and usability software in there. They know what good interviewing looks like, that type of stuff, but they also got this need to make things better. So they're like, "I need to create a system to do this." They're good at operationalizing stuff. I think that's a skill for everybody. They're like, "I can build a system to fix this." That's actually a really good interview guild that I would ask a product ops person and I never came up with it. I never thought about that before, but it's like, "Tell me about some process or something that you had to do in your job that you really hated and that you ended up just trying to automate a way or build a system around it to make it better." That would be a great interview question for anybody in those roles, I think. 

(00:55:27):
With the user and market insights person too, there's not a ton of people out there doing this, but there is a little research ops movement out there that I think could be really valuable here. So Jen Cardello, who is our case study on Fidelity, she runs their user insights team there and she's our VP of, I think it's user insights and she does oversee all the user researchers as well, but she also oversees a research ops team, and the research ops team is responsible for building their participant database. They also help build toolkits for people to do user research. They oversee any of the user research tools. They also go out and train other people in doing good user research. 

(00:56:07):
So with them, that looks like not everybody's allowed to go talk to customers and financial firms like this because of compliance reasons. They make sure they certify people to be able to go do good research up to certain points and they get levels for how far they can go so that they can democratize the research and help put it into their hands. Then if there's compliant issues around different research studies, they come back to Jen's team and the user researchers will help them complete it. 

(00:56:33):
So it's about how we ... There's a lot of legal things about what you can say and what you can't say to customers and stuff like that, what you can ask them, and they're navigating those complexities around there. So Jen comes from a research ops background. She comes from a whole UX background, but research ops is her thing and she's fantastic at setting up that stuff. She and I worked together at Athenahealth and she did that there. So I watched her put that into place and it was amazing and now she does it at Fidelity. 

(00:57:00):
So if you find somebody with that background, golden, but if you find somebody who ... If you can't find somebody like Jen because there's only one Jen, you should look for somebody who has at least a user research background, probably some UX background. They're really good at doing that and they want to operationalize it.

Lenny (00:57:18):
Jen's about to get a bunch of LinkedIn requests too.

Melissa Perri (00:57:22):
Sorry for your inbox, Jen.

Lenny (00:57:23):
I feel like the research team is going to hate people now for pulling you into product ops. Who would you suggest product ops report to generally at least to start?

Melissa Perri (00:57:35):
Head a product. 

Denise Tilles (00:57:35):
CPO. 

Lenny (00:57:38):
Such a clear, quick answer. I love it. How do they find time to train and work with this person? Are they the right-hand person that helps them just make everything more efficient? What's a way? What's that relationship like?

Melissa Perri (00:57:50):
I think definitely their right-hand person, and we say to a lot of CPOs, especially high growth companies, "Make your first hire just a product ops person to help you get this data out and start looking at it," because that helps them with board meetings, it helps them set strategy. Usually when you walk into a growth stage company, that's the first thing that you need to do is make sure that it's working, that you need to set it. Typically, when you're getting hired, there's usually a strategy problem and that person, they're like your right-hand man trying to operationalize that. So I definitely think that you're going to be guiding them there. 

(00:58:23):
I think this comes back to our question though about, do you hire somebody with experience or do you hire somebody who's new to it? If you as a CPO don't have a lot of time to train up somebody on product ops because you've got 8,000 fires to fight, then hire somebody with experience who knows how to do it and operationalize it. If you are like, "My biggest issue is business data and insights," for example, "and I just need to get my data so that I can do the strategy pieces and then I need to think through and work through what I want product ops to look like," maybe then you just hire the data analyst. If they're confident in the data analysis piece, it's pretty easy, I haven't done this myself, to teach them about what types of information you need to see as a product person. They're going to need a lot more handholding at the beginning because they're not going to know all the different cuts of data, but it's not an investment of an inordinate amount of time to be able to get something valuable back. 

(00:59:20):
It's not like training for 40 hours a week and then waiting six months to see results. It's more about, "I need you to go pull these types of cuts. Here's why. Let me explain to you this so that you learn it and then you can think about it next time," but that's going to help you there too. So I think it really depends. So how fast you need product ops fully rolled out and then how much time you have to train people, and then where you're starting from there and how big and how much buy-in you have to grow this thing from the get-go.

Lenny (00:59:49):
Awesome. Maybe as a last question, I'd love to go through a quick case study of a company you worked with and just share maybe how you rolled it out, what you ran into, challenges you had to overcome, and maybe the benefits and impact that adding this role had.

Melissa Perri (01:00:06):
When I was at Athenahealth, we were doing a ... Athenahealth has always been a software company, so let me put it that way, but they didn't have a formal product management role and they had just implemented it when I came in. So the chief product officer brought me in. He did not have an extensive product background, so he said, "I need to train all these product people and figure out what to do with this organization." So I came in to help him do that. We had over 360 product managers. We had 5,000 software developers there and it was a massive platform, $8 billion in market cap, I think, electronic health record system. 

(01:00:42):
So this is where I started to realize we needed product ops. This was me discovering this. So I'll tell you how we rolled it out and probably what we would do differently next time, but we had trained all the product managers. People were starting to use a lot of the things that we were teaching, and we saw that the maturity was getting a lot better in the organization, which was fantastic, but then we started to run into these problems, and these problems that we found could not be solved by just training product managers, and that's where the concept for product ops came up. 

(01:01:11):
We also realized we had way too many product managers, just way too many product managers. There was one person reporting into one person all the way down, and we were like, "This is not helpful." So we ended up training everybody, teaching people about what the role was, and then thinking through as we encounter these other problems, "What else do we need besides product managers?" Product ops became one of the things. We also had people actually move out of product management into other roles. We had people become data analysts, we had people become user researchers, we had people go into other parts of the organization, but a lot of people after we trained them actually just self-selected out of product management and some of them did come to us and say, "What else is there?" 

(01:01:53):
When we looked at the product ops role, we said, "Okay. What are the big fires that we have to fight that's just not from a lack of skills perspective?" That's a big part about product ops. It's not a replacement for product managers or product leaders not having product management skills. It's to help skilled product managers and product leaders do their job better. So this will never replace the fact that people don't have the skills to do their job. 

(01:02:19):
So where we ran into issues was, one, getting insights back to the executives on what the teams were actually doing. So the CEO and I were sitting there trying to set strategy and set the vision for the company and I was helping him formulate it into written form and help him deploy it and think through where we want it to go. He was in Jira, digging around in Jira trying to find information on what people were working on, and I was like, "You're not going to find that in Jira, especially when we've got hundreds of thousands of tickets for 5,000 people. You're not going to find this in there." 

(01:02:57):
That started to show me, "Hey, he's looking for this. What do you want to see?" He's looking for a portfolio roadmap of what everybody's doing and he wanted to see what are the big pushes we're making from a feature perspective and how do they tie back to our overall strategy and our goals. What's going to help our retention? What's going to help us get new customers? What's going to help us move into the enterprise, which was a big thing we were doing going upmarket into hospitals? We had no transparency into the allocation of R&D on that and also the roadmaps on that. 

(01:03:29):
So one of the things that we were trying to do in product ops was build that view, try to figure out how we get people to put the right information into Jira at the right level. So we actually had to train people on how to write ... At the time, we only had Jira, so epics in Jira that were not just build a button, they were more substantial than that. They actually had to meet behind it so we could look at it. Then we had to go out and find the right software to roll that up into a portfolio view so the executives could get the insights they were looking for.

(01:04:00):
We also had to build a way to track the OKRs that were deployed and actually see where it was. So we had to build the dashboards for that. So we started there and that became really important because that was a big issue was just the executive visibility, how do we make consistent roadmaps across the organizations, how do we get visibility into what's going on. As we started to identify more and more things, we said, "We're a huge team. We should actually have somebody overseeing this." 

(01:04:27):
Data and insights was a really big issue in the company in general, and we knew we had to instrument things better, and at the time, they brought in Amplitude and they were starting to put an Amplitude everywhere in the organization, but it wasn't fully rolled out yet. So we had these people who were going around trying to help the individual product teams get the information out of Amplitude and we said, "We need this to be more of a consistent thing, a consistent program." 

(01:04:52):
So that sparked the need for having our first product operations leader. So we ended up creating a VP of product operations and somebody moved from the product management role into that. She was much more of a process type person. She wanted to really help arm the teams into being able to get good data out there, but she understood product management well enough where she knew how all this stuff worked and she wanted to create the systems internally. 

(01:05:17):
So reporting into her, we had a business data and insights team that was overseeing Amplitude rollout and they were also putting people around the director level overseeing usually five to let's say eight Scrum teams on the director level, sometimes smaller just depending on the product. We had a business data and insights person embedded at that level to help get the ad hoc reports out now because we weren't well-instrumented. We said, "We're still making the programs and the shared services at the top level, but these people need to make decisions today. So how do we get them to do that?" So she oversaw that team. She had somebody directed there. 

(01:05:55):
then we also had the people looking at the portfolio views and the governance and the rollout and the rollout of that getting put into that as well. So that helped us get going with that. On the other side, so this didn't fall under product operations at the time, but like I said, Jen Cardello was doing research ops there and leading this team around the user insights. She got the participant database out. That was fantastic. She got out a bunch of different user research tools. They made a design systems database too that helped us be able to do prototyping a lot faster and have consistent design processes, which was amazing.

(01:06:32):
The head of UX reported into the chief product officer. So it still fell under the CPO, but it reported into the head of UX on that side and that was totally fine because we just collaborated with them pretty much all the time. So that's how we started to roll it out and get going and that's where that need was and it became so much better to get the insights that we needed out there. 

(01:06:53):
Then what happened was, actually, Athenahealth at this time, it was really wild and private. So this is where I left and a lot of leaders left at the same time, but they ended up restructuring it and they actually kept the product ops team. So now, Tim Davenport oversees product ops team. He was the chief of staff for the chief product officer at the time and he's been building it, again, taking the stuff that worked and then building onto it, and they're actually one of our key studies in the book as well about what Tim's doing now and how he's orchestrated as well to help with opex and capex and accounting type issues that they were having too. 

(01:07:28):
So Athenahealth has been through many different restructurings since I've been there, but they have always kept product ops and their current chief product officer said that he will never go anywhere else that doesn't have product ops. That's how much he believes in it.

Lenny (01:07:43):
Wow. What a testament to the value of product ops, 100% retention on the role through all these transitions. One of the interesting things you said is within this VP of product ops managed a bunch of different people and teams, which is really interesting because I always imagine product ops VP would manage product ops people. Is that common where they lead, say, there's a data team you mentioned and a few other team?

Melissa Perri (01:08:06):
Yeah. In this case, we did have her managing the business data and insights people and they were data analysts. I wouldn't say they were data engineers or anything like that, but there were people who were really good at pulling SQL and analyzing data from a product perspective. We actually moved. I should say this as well. We moved a lot of people who didn't want to be product managers but were good at that out of the role and into that role. So they had some product background, they had been trained in product, they were really good at the data pieces, but they were more suited for that than they were suited for product management. Like I said, a lot of people opted out. They were like, "Get me out of this role. I don't want to do this." They wanted more of a transactional type role or diving into data, and a lot of it came down to I think people under anticipate how much they're going to have to deal with stakeholders, and once they have to, they're like, "Oh, God, I don't want to do this," and I see that over and over again when it happens with product management. 

(01:09:00):
So she oversaw them, but they did work closely with the data people on the CTO side. There was a whole data team on the CTO side who were doing more of the database administration and the instrumentation of things. They were also helping to roll out Amplitude, instrument it correctly, and building the right views and things like Amplitudes or the other product analytics or other tools that they were using. We did not have Tableau at the time. That was something that was added later, but they were in charge of utilizing the data and trying to build those insights.

Lenny (01:09:33):
Amazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've never done this with two people. We'll see how it goes. So you can pick the question you want to take or both answer. Here we go. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Denise Tilles (01:09:48):
I'll take that. Of course, Escaping the Build Trap. It's true. 

Melissa Perri (01:09:51):
I thought you would say that. 

Denise Tilles (01:09:54):
Another one that I recommend is called Traffic. It came out this year by Ben Smith, around the invention and growth of HuffPo and Gawker and whatnot. I was in media at Condé Nast then, so peripherally part of it. It's an exciting ride that has an ending that we all know, but it's a good story, good tale.

Melissa Perri (01:10:15):
The Art of Action I think is a fantastic book on strategy and I always recommend this to people and it's out of the realm. There's a lot of great product management books out there too, but I like this one because it's a sleeper hit, I think, in the product management community. It is a fantastic description of deploying strategy and how you can tell if strategy is well-deployed in organizations or if there's gaps that you need to fill. So I find that when people read it, they go, "Oh, my God, we have all of these problems," and I'm like, "Yup, that's a strategy deployment and strategy creation problem. That's pretty apparent." So that's my favorite book to recommend to people. I love Theresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits. Fantastic book as well, just to give a shout out in the product world too.

Lenny (01:10:57):
Next question, favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Denise Tilles (01:11:01):
Deutschland 82, 86, 89. It's on Hulu. Highly recommend it, about East Germany. 

Lenny (01:11:08):
Like Pedal.

Denise Tilles (01:11:09):
Yeah, really great.

Melissa Perri (01:11:12):
I am going to go ... I just watched the House of Usher on Netflix. I love the ... It's Halloween right now. Well, it was just Halloween. 

Denise Tilles (01:11:12):
Perfect. 

Melissa Perri (01:11:22):
So I was watching all the scary movies, but I love the Netflix genre of everything from the Haunting of Hill House. Those were great.

Lenny (01:11:31):
Amazing. I started watching that and then I gave up quickly, but I should give it another chance. My wife and I have been stuck on Love is Blind. Classic.

Denise Tilles (01:11:39):
Same. 

Melissa Perri (01:11:40):
Good one.

Denise Tilles (01:11:40):
Same. 

Melissa Perri (01:11:40):
Good one. 

Lenny (01:11:41):
What a terrible, wonderful show.

Denise Tilles (01:11:43):
It is. It's the high low.

Lenny (01:11:45):
Next question, do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask when you're hiring people?

Denise Tilles (01:11:49):
When was the last time you changed your mind about something really important and why? So do they have a learning mindset? Do they have self-awareness? Can they acknowledge where they were and how they evolved? So that's usually a pretty insightful question.

Melissa Perri (01:12:06):
Mine's probably tell me about a time that you failed and what happened. That one's an interesting one too because if nobody has an example of a time that they failed, that right there is an interesting sign. Two, I feel like everybody tries to turn it into a positive story. They really try to spin it and I'm like, "I don't even want you to spin it. I just want to tell me what you learned." It's fine to say what you learned at the end of that. I think that's okay, but they're like, "Oh, but this happened and all these things were great afterwards," and I'm like, "I'm not looking for a fantastic outcome. I'm just looking for did you fail and did you learn something from it." 

Lenny (01:12:43):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Melissa Perri (01:12:47):
Well, there's one I'm going to have to plug. It's not that I recently discovered it, but I talked about all the issues that we had at Athenahealth with the portfolio management system, and after that, I discovered Dragon Boat and I'm now on their advisory board, but it helped me solve that problem. So much of rolling up everything that was in Jira sits on top of it and being able to look at it in a great view. So that was so, so good. 

(01:13:13):
Another one that I have not been involved with but that I just really love because I think they're doing great things with, again, in the product ops world, is Dovetail and they are a research repository out there and they're also putting AI on top of it to help generate insights into all the research that's been done. I have no affiliation with Dovetail, but I really love what they're doing because I've had that problem of us rolling our own research repository over and over and over again, and now we've got a tool out there to do it.

Denise Tilles (01:13:42):
I guess the one I would mention is Vistali, and some product leaders that I'm working with right now are playing around with it, and it's an interesting tool that's a single workspace that you can connect your strategy and discovery and delivery visually and guides people along those paths as well. So interested to play with it more, but it piqued my interest.

Lenny (01:14:05):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, often share with someone, come back to often to help either with work or with life?

Denise Tilles (01:14:15):
Mine's both, especially with teams that I'm working with or cross-functional stakeholders that if you try to serve everybody, you serve no one. So it's about honing in on who you're actually building your product for, who your persona is, and then with my children in terms of try to be everyone's friend, but it may not happen. So it goes both ways.

Melissa Perri (01:14:37):
What's the worst that can happen with most of the things that I've done? To me when I get scared about something or trying to do something or even interpersonal reactions where I'm like, "God, I have to have this hard conversation with this person," my brain, I try to tell myself, "What's the worst that can happen?" Usually when you sit down and start to think about it, it's not as bad as you anticipate. So for me, that's always helped me manage my anxiety around difficult situations or taking a leap and trying to get out there. I think in my younger days, I was a little crippled by overthinking and by being too anxious about things and not taking big leaps. So I've tried to stick by that and keep asking myself, "What's the worst that can happen?" and it's usually not as bad as you think it is. 

Lenny (01:15:27):
I love that. Final question, since there's two of you, we'll end in a really sweet way. What's one thing you really admire about each other?

Denise Tilles (01:15:36):
Melissa is a legend, but behind the legend, she's just a really great collaborative person. So of course, we got to know each other really well writing this book together. We worked together before that, but it was a really great way of staying connected to a former colleague, someone in the industry. Especially during COVID, it was a really great way of building towards something that was bigger than the both of us. So what I love about her is that she's really revered by so many folks, but really approachable and really truly wants to help people.

Melissa Perri (01:16:16):
Thanks, Denise. What I love about Denise is she's really this calming, patient presence and she approaches everything with so much professionalism, but also can really get to the meat of the problem, help calm down certain situations where escalated, turn them around, and she's got this patience and calm about her in everything that she does that helps you focus, helps you concentrate on the big issues and she can really steer people in the right direction. So to me, I've always admired watching her coach and lead people. She led her analysts at Produx Labs as well. When things would go slightly awry or a situation would go out of hand, Denise was always like, "Nope, we'll just fix it," and dove in and was able to make it better. I always really appreciated that.

Denise Tilles (01:17:13):
Oh, shocks. We might've had a few of the what's the worst that could happen moments, right?

Melissa Perri (01:17:16):
Always.

Lenny (01:17:17):
Amazing. You two are awesome. For folks listening, make sure to grab their book, Product Operations. You can find it on Amazon, I imagine. Share where else people can find it, but two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Denise Tilles (01:17:32):
Productoperations.com, we've got some downloadables that are available for folks and questions if you want to get in touch with us. How can they help us? I'm trying to think here.

Melissa Perri (01:17:44):
Tell us your stories about product operations. We want to hear how people are implementing it, what's working, what's not working. We're always learning about this too, and I think we said in this book, it's ticking off now, but it's by no means standardized. So we want to hear about what's happening, how has your company been successful or not successful with it, what have you seen work, what have you seen not work. So definitely reach out and let us know about it. Also, you can help us by buying the book and leaving us an Amazon review if you do read it because that does help authors and we self-publish this one too, so that always helps us on there. 

(01:18:17):
You can find both of us on LinkedIn as well. I'm Melissa Jean Perri, I think on, there, but if you look for Melissa Perri, I usually pop up and Denise Tilles. Then if you want to contact us, product operations.com, we got a form on there to reach out.

Lenny (01:18:31):
Productoperations.com. Is that the best way to find where to buy the book or are there other sites you recommend people go check it out?

Melissa Perri (01:18:37):
We do. We just got it. Self-publishing has been fun, but we just got it where it is distributing now to Barnes and Noble and other bookstores. So you can usually find it on anything, but if you go to the website, it will have the most up-to-date information on where you can find it. Then if you go to your bookstore and some people are against Amazon, so if you go to your bookstore and ask for it, they will be able to order it for you.

Lenny (01:19:00):
Amazing. Thank you two for being here.

Melissa Perri (01:19:03):
Thanks for having us.

Denise Tilles (01:19:04):

# An inside look at Deel’s unprecedented growth | Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (Head of Growth)

## Transcript

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:00:00):
... early days, it's very important to just go back to the basics, build the skeleton before you put on the makeup. So the first question I would ask is, do you have a website? Is it fast? Do the search engine knows that it exists? Okay, great. The next step would be, can people find it? If they can't find it, do you need to write content to make sure that people can find it? Only after all of those questions are answered, should you then consider, do I have money? Can I put it behind some paid ads to make sure people come to my website? You can't run a successful paid ads program if you have a website that's loading in four plus seconds. So really going back to the basics and starting from a good experience at the core and then expanding step-by-step from there.

Lenny (00:00:47):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz. Meltem is head of growth at Deel, which is arguably the fastest growing SaaS business of all time, possibly even faster than Ramp, which we delved into in a previous episode. They went from $0 in revenue to a mind-boggling $300 million in revenue in three years, while also staying EBITDA positive.

Lenny (00:01:15):
Meltem has led their growth team from the early days. And today leads all their growth efforts, including paid ads, product marketing, content, community, brand and more. Before joining Deel, she was leading marketing efforts at Bench Accounting. In our conversation, Meltem shares how Deel kick started growth through low-cost growth channels like tapping into communities like Reddit and also content and SEO. She also talks about how she evolved her thinking on growth investments as the company grew. She shares a bunch of tactical advice for how to do SEO well, how to do paid ads well, and how to structure your early growth team and prioritize your early investments. She also shares her experience building a culture of speed and optimism and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Meltem Kuran Berkowitz after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:01):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself, go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people have published in the Miro-verse. When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works.

Lenny (00:02:44):
Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:03:10):
Today's episode is brought to you by LMNT. I just recently discovered this stuff actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. LMNT is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. LMNT is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes. Also dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on LMNT to stay hydrated along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines.

Lenny (00:03:52):
You can try LMNT totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is Watermelon Salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty.

Lenny (00:04:22):
Meltem, thank you so much for being here, welcome to the podcast.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:04:26):
Thank you for having me, I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:28):
I'm more excited that you're here. So you're head of growth at Deel. For people that aren't familiar with Deel, can you just give us a sense of what does Deel do briefly? And then also can you just share some stats around the trajectory of Deel? It feels like it's been this extraordinary journey, and I'm curious just to hear some of the stats of just how extraordinary.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:04:46):
Yeah, so Deel is payroll, HR, and compliance platform for global teams. So essentially we help companies expand globally with tools like Deel HR, immigration, employer record hiring, independent contractor hiring, payroll, both global and US. So whether you're trying to hire someone as a full-time employee in Japan or you're trying to make sure your contractor in Germany has everything they need on day one, our platform allows you to take care of everything all in one place.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:05:13):
And when I joined Deel, actually that was around July, 2020, we were less than a million dollars in ARR. And then over time, within the first year on January, 2021, we were at $4 million ARR. We finished 2021 with 57 million. April '22, we were looking at a hundred million. And then we started off this year with $295 million in ARR. And what we're particularly proud of is that we've been EBITDA positive. So that's something that we are very, very proud of on top of the ARR growth.

Lenny (00:05:48):
Amazing. And you said that you were super early at Deel. Can you give us a sense of just how early and what that was like?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:05:54):
I was the second hire to the marketing team, and I was I believe either employee 19 or 20 on the overall Deel team.

Lenny (00:06:02):
We had the head of product from Ramp on this podcast, and it feels like there's this little bit of which company grew faster early on in the trajectory of the two, but we don't have to debate it. It feels like these are maybe the two fastest growing SaaS businesses in history. Does that sound about right?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:06:16):
That's true, yeah. So Ramp was the first one to be crowned the fastest growing, and then we took that crown from them. So I think we're both right, in that at a certain point in time we've each been the fastest growing. But they're amazing.

Lenny (00:06:34):
What I want to start with is something that I heard about you, which is that you specialize in cheaper growth channels, and that's actually the reason that Deel ended up hiring you, is they wanted to find ways to grow cheaply. And so a couple of questions. One is just, what did you find worked really well from that perspective at Deel? And then two, what are today's maybe cheaper growth channels that you think people are under investing in? Whatever you're willing to share there, I don't know if you want to give away all your secrets.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:06:56):
I'm happy to give away all and everything. So I think before we dive into the list of cheap channels, which I will get to, it's very important to notice, especially in the B2B world, most of the businesses are started because there's an active problem. And so when you go out to the market and try to answer people's questions, people don't want to be sold to, they want their problem solved. So those cheaper channels are often places where people are just trying to get an answer to their question. So whether that be search engine optimization through the articles that you write for people, looking onto Reddit where people are asking these questions in communities, forming partnerships with other groups that are trying to answer these questions, existing communities where other business leaders are connecting with each other and looking at their peers to find answers to shared problems that they're having, or places like Quora. That's, when you think about cheap channels, that's a really good place to start, is just add value to people, answer their questions.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:07:54):
And when you answer their questions and present your solution, if it's a fit to what they're looking for, that ends up being a cheap channel for you. You don't necessarily have to advertise, when you go to Reddit and you set up those keywords to be tracking when people ask certain questions, you're not paying any money to do that. You're just seeing, oh, someone has this question, I have the answer to that, here you go. And connecting with them, it takes time. But early on, those were a lot of the things that we invested in.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:08:21):
And I think a lot of people jump that because they think, "Oh, it's one person here, two people there." But when you start helping people, that combined with word of mouth, and guess what, these are digital places, you provide one answer and your answer lives out there for other people to repeatedly refine. As long as we're not talking about a closed Slack community, maybe a conversation happening in DMs. So when I think about cheap channels, I think about where are people asking the questions, that might be Google or that might be Reddit or any other channel, and providing them the answers, so they know that your solution exists.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Okay, this is awesome. So this Reddit example is that, which you actually did, you set alerts for when people have questions about HR hiring internationally I imagine, and then had someone go in there and give them some advice?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:09:10):
Yes, exactly that's what we did.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Wow, I love that.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:09:12):
It's important to notice that if you're looking at a subreddit of about a thousand people, recognize the upper size of this audience, you're not going to win 5,000 businesses through that Reddit community, but you're maybe going to win 10% of the people there that are having this problem. So it's very important when investing in these cheap channels to focus on what's the upper limit of the audience size.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:09:36):
And also I see a lot of people sometimes go blindly into SEO. They're like, "We're just going to write content," which I'm a huge fan of SEO, happy to discuss that later, but if people aren't asking this question to Google, you can write all the content you want, it doesn't matter, nobody's going to find it.

Lenny (00:09:52):
I love this so much, because it connects with something I find again and again, is one of the more effective early growth channels is tapping into an existing community and piggybacking off of what they've already built. Airbnb is a little bit of an example where they went to Craigslist. Actually most people pull people off Craigslist, Uber pull people off Craigslist, Lyft, so many companies just piggybacked off Craigslist and built up their own company.

Lenny (00:10:13):
But what you said is so important, which is you can't just go into a community and be like, "Hey, everyone, check out what I've got." You need to add value to people and add value to the community, otherwise no one's going to pay attention to you, they're going to kick you out.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:10:25):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:10:25):
And so I think that is a really important insight is if you're trying to say piggyback off of a community, the most important thing is you need to add value to the community.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:10:34):
Yeah, be someone people actually want to talk to.

Lenny (00:10:37):
I love that. Is there a tool that you found for that Reddit strategy of just how to know if someone's talking about hiring say internationally?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:10:45):
I did a very janky assistant setup, I'm not proud of it, but it works. Someone else out there built it and I just plugged in the keywords we were looking for into it.

Lenny (00:10:57):
I know it wasn't just Reddit, and I'm curious what else you found was worth your time, but how did you figure out that's where your potential community and potential users were spending time?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:11:06):
Well, I think over time Reddit became the place that you go to when you want peer answers, whether that peer is someone right next to you or someone halfway across the world. So it was a very obvious place for me to go to understand, what's top of mind for my audience? But also there are so many subreddits, whether it's founders or HR managers, that people are just asking their community. Because oftentimes they have very specific questions. You can't just ask that to Google because they have one thing that means that they might not be able to qualify for the exact solution that is what's most used out there. So Reddit just became the place over the years for people to ask their specific questions semi-anonymously and get answers from their community, and multiple answers to be able to judge which works better versus didn't. So it was one of the first places that myself and my team went to.

Lenny (00:11:58):
And is this something that worked really well, mostly at the beginning to kickstart growth or how early was this? And then how much of your growth would you say came from this sort of strategy early on?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:12:07):
I believe I set up that little keyword tracking within the first day of me starting my role at Deel. So it was very, very early. And we still do this by the way. We still provide answers across Reddit, Quora communities. We're still out there connecting with people. Over time, of course, it went from maybe being 15% of our funnel to less than 5% of our funnel because the rest of our funnel has grown a lot. But the next number of people that we get to share our solution with through those channels have continued to grow over time.

Lenny (00:12:43):
Coming back to something I asked that I want to touch on is, in today's world are there any cheaper growth channels that you are excited about? Or is it essentially the same idea? Look for where your potential users are and ideally asking questions that you could help answer? Is that roughly how you think about it still?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:12:58):
That is still roughly how I think about it. I would add social channels to that as well. I think Twitter's a great place, people ask questions oftentimes, so there are communities. And when someone has answered that question, other people piggyback off of that. But anywhere where someone is asking a question, I would consider to fall into this category of a cheap channel.

Lenny (00:13:17):
What's an example of answering a question in a value-add way versus a maybe less effective way in your experience?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:13:25):
I would say the least effective way would be, "Hey, we've solved that problem, check out our website." Okay, cool, if you have five seconds, do that. But the value-add way would be explaining what the solution to that problem is. Because the reality is there are a lot of people out there who can probably solve this, and then providing your solution, but answer their question first, and then let them decide if they want to come with you or go with someone else. But the whole point of someone asking a question isn't to be sold a solution. It's like, "I just need an answer." So genuinely treat this person like a friend of yours, answer their question, be like, "Yes, it's doable. No, it's not doable. Yes, you can do it, but you need to consider X, Y, Z. If you want to learn more about it, you can chat with us."

Lenny (00:14:04):
And these were people on the team or you answering these questions, it wasn't some automated system?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:14:09):
It was never automated. It still isn't today. We would never automate our interactions with people. So early days, it was myself, the other people on my team, our co-founders, which to this day they still do by the way. So it's a lot of people on the team. Every single person on the team has access to these. And whoever is the first person to jump in will flag it. And sometimes you'll see on a Twitter, someone will write a question, there's three people from Deel team has answered. We're like, "Okay, I think enough of us have provided value here."

Lenny (00:14:41):
That's amazing. And I'm spending a lot of time on this, but this is such an interesting and important tactic that clearly worked to help you all start and it's cheap. And most, at least B2B, companies could probably leverage this. So when people are thinking about where to go, maybe do this, you mentioned Twitter, maybe Reddit, maybe Quora. Is there anything else, just like the sphere of potential places founders can go think about whether maybe people are asking questions they could answer there?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:15:06):
Yeah, there are a lot of closed communities, so there are still ... they could be Slack communities, Discord, places that founders choose to connect with other founders. Or we have partnerships with places like the Y Combinator, where once you go through a certain program or you qualify to be in the club, whatever that club may be, you get to get access to this community where you can talk to other people. So those are considered closed communities. It's not as easy to gain access to. But if you can find a way to gain access to those communities, they're also great places to be.

Lenny (00:15:37):
And then step number one is add value, right?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:15:40):
Yes.

Lenny (00:15:40):
You can't just get in the community, "Hey, check out Deel everyone."

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:15:42):
Otherwise you'll just get kicked out. You can try not adding value, you're not going to last very long.

Lenny (00:15:47):
Yeah. If you think about the pie chart of how growth happened at Deel early on and then today, what would that roughly look like? What percentage of early growth came through this versus SEO or whatever else worked, and then today? Whatever you can share of where growth comes from.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:16:03):
Today, roughly about I would say 50% of our growth continues to come from what we would consider non-paid channels, through whether it be partnerships, SEO, these kinds of moderations. So early on that was more close to 80% to 90%. But that number has grown. Again, the net number has grown, but the percentage of the overall value has shrunk because other channels have also grown significantly.

Lenny (00:16:29):
Awesome. Okay. So let's talk about SEO. First of all, how important has that been to the success and growth of Deel? And then also just what have you learned about what is important to get SEO right?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:16:40):
Yeah. So I would say for SEO, the biggest mistake people make is they will just shove keywords. They're like, "Okay, these are the keywords people are searching for, I need to make sure I mention it five times." Obviously do that, make sure that the content that you wrote answers the question. But the main thing to think about it is, is the Google search over? If someone reads your content, if they typed in something to Google, and then they read the article that you've published, are they going back to Google to continue reading more or is the Google search over? Because ultimately that's what the search engines care about is, I want to make sure this person gets their answer quickest way possible.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:17:16):
So when you think from that perspective, it's much easier to actually write things that people want to read, and you're not just meandering and going on and on, shoving a bunch of keywords that people are just like, "I'm bored, I'm bouncing, I'm going somewhere else."

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:17:30):
So asking that question of, is the search over is a really good place to start, instead of just shoving keywords. And our content team is amazing. I would say they're more of an operational team than they are a creative team. The way they run things, the way they publish the articles, there's a very clear framework that is used to decide what gets published when and what doesn't get published by the same token. So all of those things are very important to consider, instead of just being like, "Oh, this keyword has 10,000 monthly visitors, I'm just going to write a bunch of things about that."

Lenny (00:18:02):
What's an example of a page that you wrote that ends people search and gives them what they need?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:18:07):
A lot of people wonder what an EOR is because that's an employer of record. They tend to be confused about exactly what that is. So we do very well in explaining to people what EOR is and isn't and what its limitations are. Because the first question that you will have after the EOR question's answered is, okay, what's the downside? When do I need to not use it? So for us, that's one of the content pieces that does very well.

Lenny (00:18:32):
I'd love to spend more time on this operational element of the SEO team. Maybe one question is just what is that bar that tells you that it's ready to publish and worth going out versus it's not ready?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:18:42):
Yes. So I can't take credit to this, this is all of our team's work. But we have this framework that we call the traffic light system. Essentially we go, whenever the team is going to do a content series, they will go and find up to 700 keywords. These are keywords that are related to what we do. So they might be closely related, they might be distant related. And then those set of keywords get ranked by highest volume to the lowest volume. So then you have an Excel sheet, keywords on the left, volume on the right. And then you go one by one. This does take time. And then say, what is the intent of someone searching this keyword?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:19:22):
Is this a university student looking to write an article and they're never going to become our customer? Or is this someone that is actually looking to solve their existing solution and they are going to become our customer? So with that, you get the green light ones, which is the intent is very high, this person wants our solution. The yellow light is intent, could be they are a 50:50, maybe they're looking to buy our solution, maybe it's not soon enough. And then the red is, this person is not looking to buy our solution, they're just doing this search for any other reason. So when you do that, then you go from the greens, highest volume to the lowest volume, yellows, highest volume to the lowest volume, and oftentimes you never get to the reds.

Lenny (00:20:03):
I love that. And then once you have say a keyword, say a green, I guess, it's a green keyword where it's high intent and high volume, what is the process to actually put together an article that works for SEO?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:20:16):
So step one is understanding the search intent. Why is someone typing that? What are they trying to understand? And a part of that is going to Google and figuring out, what is Google servicing today? So one of the examples that I always give people of when you type EOR into Google, it doesn't give you employer of record, it gives you enhanced oil recovery, because most of the people typing EOR to Google is looking for that solution.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:20:43):
Now, if my team blindly went in and said, "We're going to rank for EOR," we're never going to rank for that because that's not what Google gives people because that's not what people have been looking for. So first is understanding, what are people looking for? And creating a content piece that answers those questions. Oftentimes the bottom part of Google where it says, the next questions that you should be asking is a really good place to go to understand, okay, after someone's done with this search, what's the next question that they ask? And the next one and the next one.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:21:11):
So figuring out what do people want to get out of this? And then there are a myriad of SEO solutions tools that you can use out there to ensure that the content you've written is in a simple enough language that someone with a fifth grade reading level can understand. That you actually did the right things, you put the right keywords in the right places. I almost think of keywords as like, that's your address, that's how you give Google, please send people my way. So you can use many tools.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:21:38):
We use Clearscope, we love it. So those are the tools that you use. And then it gets published. And oftentimes those tools will give you a score to say you're an A plus or you're a C minus, you need to make your language less sophisticated, currently it's at university level and we need it to be at fourth grade reading level.

Lenny (00:21:55):
What is the structure of the content team at this point, how many people is it, and what are their rough focuses?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:22:00):
Fun fact about our content team, the person that leads it was one of the earliest employees at Deel, I want to say number two or three. So the person there is just so special to our entire company. And so the structure of the content team for us is, it is led by our director of content. We have one person that is in charge of all of the operations. So that is working with our freelancers, making sure that the briefs are sent out, making sure that the fact checking is done on time, that the articles are published on the website, and tracking and everything, they run the machinery on the backend.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:22:33):
And then we have different people focused on different areas of content because you need to have expertise that you build over time to write properly. So we have one person looking after certain product lines, another person would be focusing on [inaudible 00:22:46] behind different product lines. And very recently we've set out a team for different types of content because content isn't just written article, it's also video, it's also education. There's a lot of different types of content that we want to tap into. So now there's a team that is focused on those new mediums for us.

Lenny (00:23:04):
Awesome. So how many people total full-time that run this operation?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:08):
Right now the team is about eight people total.

Lenny (00:23:11):
And it's like, I don't know if it's exactly 50% of it, something like half of your growth essentially is coming from this team?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:17):
Yes.

Lenny (00:23:18):
Is there anything else you found that it's really important or effective for thinking about making SEO work?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:23):
The biggest mistake people make is SEO is one of those things that, you can try and automate it, you can do a lot of things that save you time, but it never stops being time-consuming. And to do it well, it is going to be time-consuming. So oftentimes people just get over it or they think it's below them to be going over and doing keyword research and doing all of those things one by one. And that's oftentimes where people lose out is they try to cut corners. And when you cut corners, you just don't create a good quality resource. That's what it comes down to. It's like, is your resource good quality? Yes or no?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:55):
So when you try to just be like, I want to rank and cut all those corners, your content is not going to be great. Nobody's going to want to read it. And your program is not going to go anywhere. So I think it's one of those things that people as they become more senior think it's below them. And I think that's the biggest mistake.

Lenny (00:24:11):
It's interesting, and that's exactly the same advice for writing a newsletter, the thing I do. Where if a newsletter isn't working, it usually means the content isn't valuable enough to people. It's such a clear meritocracy of, if it's useful, people will read it, subscribe, share. And if they're not, they won't subscribe. And then Google basically figures that out based on people's behavior.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:24:30):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:24:31):
To give people a sense of the operation, how many articles are you putting out a month, a day, a week, whatever you can share there?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:24:38):
We used to put out about 10 articles a week, that's net new. Whereas now we are doing more of five new articles and five article updates. Because the type of content we write, regulations change, things change all the time, so we need to make sure that even if something was published two years ago, it's up-to-date. So we have a team that is responsible for continuously fact checking. So we do about five article updates and five net new articles written. And of course we do it across many different languages. So what started off as English only operations is now in other languages as well. So there's no shortage of work to go around.

Lenny (00:25:15):
Something that I go back and forth on a bit is, if SEO is something every company should be doing and will work for them? And in my experience, there's certain products that are really good for SEO, especially if there's user generated content or there's just a bunch of data like say Yelp or Glassdoor, where they can generate tons of pages in all these different ways. Do you have an opinion on what sort of business and company is best suited for SEO? Or is your feeling everyone should probably be doing SEO in some form? And even if it's not a huge part of your growth strategy, it'll help.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:25:47):
I don't think everybody should be doing SEO. I think if you are in a space where people are looking for a solution, you should be doing SEO. But if you are a direct to consumer company selling people lipstick, which I'm a huge buyer of, you probably shouldn't invest in SEO all that much because people don't go to Google for that. They go to Instagram, they go to influencers. And even if someone types in the best lipstick of 2023, chances of your website ranking, because you're not a third party objective comparing to other people, is very low. So it really depends on the solution. But if you are in a space which most B2B products tend to be, that you're solving an active problem very specifically, then I would say SEO is a good idea. If you're a consumer good, maybe a little bit less effort should be put towards it.

Lenny (00:26:39):
Makes a lot of sense. Going back to the early days, you were hired as head of growth at Deel, there's a lot of things you could do. I'm curious how you decided where to prioritize your resources and what to do in the early days? Versus what you started doing down the road and what you could almost not worry about early on? What have you learned about that early prioritization exercise?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:26:59):
Yes. So I would say early days, it's very important to just go back to the basics, build the skeleton before you put on the makeup. So the first question I would ask is, do you have a website? Is it fast? Do the search engine knows that it exists? Okay, great. The next step would be, can people find it? If they can't find it, you need to write content to make sure that people can find it.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:27:24):
Only after all of those questions are answered, should you then consider, do I have money? Can I put it behind some paid ads to make sure people come to my website? So going step-by-step. But you can't run a successful paid ads program if you have a website that's loading in four plus seconds. So really going back to the basics and starting from a good experience at the core. And then expanding step-by-step from there is how I would suggest everybody starts. And that's what I would do if I was to get hired all over again.

Lenny (00:27:54):
I love that. So what are some of the steps? So step one is, do you have a website? Step two is make sure the website performs and people can actually have a good time when they're experiencing it. I imagine part of it is also, do people understand what you do, like tweaking maybe the pitch and the [inaudible 00:28:07]

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:28:06):
Yes, exactly. And speaking of the pitch, our copy team does an amazing job at this. In the B2B world, it's very easy to come up with statements that could so easily be applied to another business and it would work just as well on their website. And it sounds good and you and your team feel really good about it. But then if your one-liner can also work for another business, please don't let that be your one-liner. Make it so that people actually understand what you do. Because right now there's a lot of statements out there like, 'we do the complex things so you can focus on what you do best', what does that mean? And you can give that to 90% of the B2B businesses out there and it would apply to them, which means it's not good enough.

Lenny (00:28:51):
Is there anything that you remember you changed in those early days in terms of the website or the positioning or anything along those lines that was a big improvement?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:28:57):
Our website was hard coded, so the first thing we did with the help of the dev team was to move it to a platform that it was easy for me to access and edit, so that we could continuously A/B test things. And outside of that, we worked really hard on testing a lot of value propositions to explain to people exactly what we do, explain problem first, solution first, and time savings, cost savings, putting a lot of those against each other and rapidly A/B testing.

Lenny (00:29:24):
Once you got past that phase, where maybe you started doing some paid ads and other things, where did you find you could invest more resources?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:29:32):
Once we covered the basics of your big four or five ad platforms, we started looking into the long tail places. So those are the platforms that individually never contribute a significant enough chunk for you to individually care about it. But if you add them up, it diversifies your lead flow such that it ends up being about 30% of your overall lead flow that's coming in. Those could be things like review sites or much smaller outlets that could also run ads, newsletter ads, podcast ads, all of those things.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:30:06):
When you run an individual podcast ad, yeah, you're probably not going to get 2000 customers from one podcast. But you run 10 of those and then it starts adding up. So really long tail is where we focused on. And we started going very niche with websites that have maybe 50,000, a hundred thousand visitors a month, which isn't all that much when you're thinking about your paid ad strategy. But all of those places add up and they're oftentimes overlooked because they're not as easy, you have to take the time to set up from scratch to run it on everything. Our paid ads team, they spent just as much time running Facebook and Google ads as they do running those third party, much smaller platform ads. It takes the same effort, but you need to have a diversified source of your leads.

Lenny (00:30:54):
Huge fan of podcast ads over here, and maybe this would be a good time to cue the mid-roll ad, maybe, I don't know, it happens.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:30:59):
Sounds perfect.

Lenny (00:31:01):

Lenny (00:32:12):
And welcome back. Speaking of podcast ads, something that I find is with that sort of advertising, there's a direct response component of like, we will drive leads as running an ad like this, and there's also a awareness, brand building component. I know you're not a big fan of awareness campaigns and marketing campaigns, especially early on, and so I'd love to get your perspective on why that is and how you think about that sort of investment?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:32:36):
I'm not a huge fan of early awareness campaigns for B2B businesses specifically. So if you are a consumer goods founder, you can skip this part. But the reason I don't like awareness early on is because to do a proper awareness campaign, it takes time. You need to have teams that are doing the strategy, doing the creative work, and they don't always hit. You don't know if they're always going to resonate or not. And then you look back, and you've worked on this thing for a whole month and it hasn't resonated and you've wasted a full month.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:33:07):
Because B2B businesses uniquely are started because there's a very real need and there's a lot of people that are ready to convert, first tap into the bottom of the funnel, and then go out and start speaking to the masses. But I promise you it'll probably take you six to eight months minimum to tap into that bottom of the funnel of people that are ready to convert today before you have to start doing awareness ads out there. That's not to say never do awareness ads, but it's oftentimes the shiny, cool thing that you want to do and it just ends up being a waste of time early on. Because people don't really even understand what you're doing, you haven't really even figured out what's the messaging that resonates, but you've done this creative campaign and people are like, "This looks cool, but I'm just going to go ahead and continue looking for a solution for my problem."

Lenny (00:33:53):
Is there an example of a marketing campaign or an awareness campaign that comes to mind that you thought was like, "Okay, this is ... if you do it this way, maybe it's worth doing"?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:34:01):
I've seen Notion do a great job with their out-of-home ads. They didn't do it early on, they started doing it much later in their journey by the time when everybody that was working in tech knew what it was, and it was really to drive home the message continuously rather than to introduce themselves to the world. So by then when you saw that layout on a billboard, it made sense, you're like, "Oh, I know what they're talking about."

Lenny (00:34:23):
So what is it about Notion that you think was great, it was timing and then also the actual ad itself you thought was great?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:34:30):
Yeah, the ads that I'm recalling right now were showcasing their product interface. So they needed enough time, and this is my obviously hypothesis, if someone from Notion wants to jump in and say that wasn't the reason why we did this, go ahead, but I think they needed enough time for people to get familiar with the interface. Because Notion has a very specific interface that when you see it, you recognize it, it's not like any other product. So unless people built that awareness and recognition, doing an out-of-home ad with that layout wouldn't have made much sense because just with that layout they were able to communicate what product they're talking about. If they did that day one, people would be like, "What is this thing that I'm looking at?"

Lenny (00:35:07):
So we've been working through all the ways that Deel has grown, we've talked about SEO, community, you mentioned partnerships. Is there anything interesting there to mention around just what partnerships have done?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:35:18):
Yeah, I would say it is very important to know who you should partner with. So there's two groups of partners. People oftentimes end up partnering with any company that has a shared audience. Decent place to start. But just because you share an audience doesn't mean your audience goes to your partner for guidance when they have this problem.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:35:35):
So in our case, venture capital partners was a huge one because when you get money from a new VC, they ask, they're like, "Okay, thank you for giving us this money, now we want to expand our team with the money you gave us. What are your other portfolio companies using? What is a platform that you trust that you would recommend?" So people go to their VCs for that kind of question. But there might be another tech company out there that is tapping into the exact audience that we are, but people never go to them to ask that question. So our partnership with them will likely not work just as well. So it's important to not only recognize the importance of an audience overlap as well as whether or not those people are seen as a trusted resource for the solution you are putting out there.

Lenny (00:36:16):
I really love this idea you keep coming back to, which is where are people asking this question that you can help them answer. And to make that even more concrete for people, what are some other examples maybe of questions people ask that Deel can help them with? So that it could help people think about, okay, maybe our product can help them answer these other sorts of questions

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:36:35):
Since the early days, and it continues to happen, compliance is a huge question that gets asked. So when you are an HR leader or a finance leader or a legal leader in a company that works let's say in America, but you want to hire someone in another country, you don't know what you don't know. So it's very important to have people that know what they're talking about in context of your country of origin as well as the country that you're trying to hire from. So compliance has always been a huge part of what we did and what we've always answered for people. That's why we have in-house experts that answer those questions, that constantly provide updates if the answer to that question has changed over time, which regulations constantly change. An answer we provided a week ago may change, and you need to be very proactive in communicating that.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:37:18):
Taxes is another one, especially in the space that we're in, payroll, hiring. Taxes change from country to country. You need to know when you need to pay what taxes, when you need to not pay them, and what types of work people do. So those are some of the types of questions that get asked.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:37:34):
So for us, they're very nitty-gritty and use case specific. The taxes you need to pay for someone who is an engineer that's a full-time employee might be very different than who is a designer who is a contractor. So those are the kinds of specifics that we get into with people.

Lenny (00:37:50):
Got it. So it's like, how do I pay taxes for an engineer I'm hiring in Turkey? And then you give them, "Here's the answer," and then it's like, "If you just want us to take care of it for you, then go check out Deel."

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:37:59):
Exactly. Rarely the question is what's the best payroll solution? It's like, okay, that's good to make sure what you're leaning towards isn't shit and that other people agree with you. But ultimately it was like you need the best payroll solution because you need to make sure that things aren't going to go wrong.

Lenny (00:38:15):
Speaking of answering questions in content, something that you told me is that you wrote a blog post that the IRS ended up linking to as the definitive answer to a question. And I don't think this was at Deel, but can you share that story?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:38:28):
Yes, actually it was at my previous role. And the person who wrote that article is today at Deel. So he came over to join us there too. But yes, it was right around when Covid happened and the US government rolled out the PPP program. And there was a lot of questions about, do I qualify? If I qualify, how do I apply for this?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:38:51):
And at the time the company that I was working for had a lot of customers that were like, "What do I do? I need to gain access to this, but I don't know what to do." So the team there took the time to truly understand how the system works, whether you qualify, what to do. And created this resource for our own customers because we just wanted to help them. And then it ended up being such a good resource that it was linked from the IRS's website being like, "If you have questions, check out this article," which was a great moment of pride. And it just went to show that when you do your best to answer questions and other people don't have the time to do it, no matter who it is, they're going to send people back your way. And it was at the time, it happened to be a big moment of growth.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:39:33):
It was a very unfortunate instance, we wish we never had to write that, that it never happened. But yeah, that was the story around IRS linking to the company's resource.

Lenny (00:39:44):
That's the ultimate sign of the question is answered and you're done with it, the IRS decides to link to it. So you're saying that was actually a big driver of growth, IRS traffic. I'm curious how many people actually go read that?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:39:57):
So that was huge for that short duration of a few week time when people were trying to apply for PPP. And then it died out, as did PPP.

Lenny (00:40:05):
Makes sense. One last question around paid, and then I want to move on to a different topic. Is there anything you've learned about what it takes to be successful at paid growth from your experience at Deel?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:40:15):
Yeah, so a few things. Our paid team spends a lot of time on both the messaging aspect of things as well as the optimization. So optimization is the technical way in which you set your bids, make sure that you don't go over budget, whether or not you can afford that.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:40:31):
And then messaging is making sure that if someone sees your ad, whether it's on Instagram, Twitter, Google, that it makes sense for them. So creative fatigue is a real thing. When you put an ad out there that works for three weeks, people get tired of seeing that, you need to constantly update that. So our paid team is actually updating the ads we put out there on a monthly basis with the exception of a few Google ads, which need to be straight to the point. So staying ahead of creative fatigue. Making sure that your messaging also keeps up with your product, even if the ad is working really well, you need to make sure that as your product has evolved, so has the messaging alongside that.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:41:07):
And also recognizing, not just looking at the amount of leads that you generated from a campaign, but how many of them actually became a client, and how much money did you actually make from those clients to understand things around payback. Because oftentimes marketers just tend to think about, "Oh, this is a great lead channel and I get so many leads from it." But then you ask that question to sales teams and they're like, "Yeah, I'm busy, but none of these are converting." So it's really important to look at not just the volume that you bring in, but what is the journey of that volume with your business one year out. How much money do you actually make from them to be able to properly decide how much can I spend to win this customer?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:41:44):
And the way that we've done it is we've worked with our data team to set up a dashboard that tracks that in real time. We know an average customer that comes from a Facebook ad, at what rate do they converge from a lead to a qualified opportunity to a closed on.? And then on average, how much money do we make from that customer one year out. So that we can decide, is this a worthy channel for us, do we not want to invest there or are we reaching that peak and we can't continue to invest there.

Lenny (00:42:11):
Something that I should mention as we talk through this is we're talking about all these ways to grow the product, but at the core is a great product that people actually find valuable and want to keep using. And maybe a question there is just how that plays into this whole growth strategy, actually making the product something people want versus all these acquisition channels?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:42:29):
Acquisition channels just straight up don't work if you have a product that doesn't live up to the expectation. I think I personally have been very spoiled and lucky because from the day I joined Deel, the product was top-notch. As I was joining an early stage company, I joined right after series A, I was expecting certain things to be duct taped in the back, it happens. And I was like, "Oh no, the engineers and the product team are, if they say a product can do something, it can do that and more."

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:42:59):
So early days of my team pitching Deel was people were like, "I don't think you guys can do all of that. I don't believe you." And it was almost like we had to tamper down our messaging so that people would believe us. But you can be the best marketer in the world, if when people come to your product, even if your sales team does a good job at convincing them to become a customer, because you can do that, if the product doesn't live up to the expectations, especially in the B2B world where people aren't going to put up with crappy products, they're going to leave. That's going to get out and people are going to know it's not a worthy product. So that really sits at the core of everything that we do.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:43:35):
I think it's very easy to take it for granted when you're at a company that has an awesome product, you're like, "It is like this all the time." But one of the things I would encourage anybody looking to join a young company is, ask them what their team breakdown looks like. When I joined Deel, most of the team was product and engineers. So that told me that the core of this business was going to be solid. And then we built out those supporting things like marketing, like sales, like data to surround the product. But if you are talking to an early stage company that's a B2B product and they have six salespeople and two engineers, their product probably isn't going to be great for that much longer.

Lenny (00:44:12):
Especially if it's an outsourced dev shop doing the product, they're like, "Oh, they'll take care of the product, we'll just sell it." Something else that I think is important to talk about is Covid was an important element of your growth. And so I guess, one, is that true? And then two, just what did you lean into and lean out of in terms of growth during Covid to help people discover Deel when they needed it most, which is basically people going remote in a lot of ways in a lot of companies?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:44:39):
So Covid, actually a lot of people think Deel was started as a response to the pandemic, we actually got started before the pandemic and then the pandemic happened. So as sad as it was, it did force people into a pilot program of the vision that we had for the world. It forced people to work remotely, whether that means you're working remotely from someone who lives a block away from you or you are working remotely from someone in Germany. So we did benefit from the fact that everybody was at least forced to test out this hypothesis of, does it work to not be in the same room as the people that you're working with?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:45:17):
And one of the questions that we were getting early on as the Covid was coming to an end was, "Are you worried, Covid is coming to an end, that people aren't going to use Deel anymore?" And our response to that has always been, we are not a remote work platform, we're a global work platform. So a lot of these businesses have gone back into offices. We have a lot of customers that asked people to go back to their offices, but now they have offices in Germany and in Canada and in the US and in France. So we were never a remote work company, we were just a global work company.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:45:49):
And remote work, because there was a lot of news coverage happening around it, we just became synonymous with that. So I do think early on we did benefit from being able to provide that solution. And a lot of people saw the reality of like, "Hey, I work just as well with this person as I did when I was in an office with them. Well, the best person that I'm looking for, the job may not be within my region, so let me go ahead and hire them regardless of where they are." People got comfortable with that and more and more companies started moving in that direction.

Lenny (00:46:20):
And is there anything that ended up being really important in terms of helping Deel grow through that? Like a channel that's just like, "Let's go big on this channel because it seems to be working really well"? Or is it just word of mouth basically and people are just like, "Oh shit, I really need to solve this problem, my hair's on fire, what's out there? Let me go find an answer"?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:46:36):
I wouldn't say it was word of mouth, maybe very, very early on it was word of mouth, but within the first few months of our operation that stopped being true. Or at least the word of mouth stopped being a smaller percentage of the way in which people discover us. But it's always that people needed a payroll solution, they needed a way to hire independent contractors overseas, and we just were the answer to that. So we consistently put ourselves in front of them and said, "Hey, if you're trying to do this, or if you're already doing it and you're not doing it legally, we can help you do that legally."

Lenny (00:47:10):
I want to chat about team building, something that I've heard you're exceptional at. And my first question is, early on when you were building the team, the growth team specifically, at Deel, what skills did you find were most important to look for? And what skills and experiences did you find wasn't as important early on that you could sacrifice and wait until later to get?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:47:30):
Early on one of the first questions I would ask people is, what are the KPIs that you're willing to commit to? So if someone's only willing to commit to lead numbers, that's not good enough. They need to be able to commit to closed one revenue KPRs to really show that they care about the business's bottom line. So it was those people that were willing to commit to the full funnel.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:47:53):
And also oftentimes people tend to hire from the big companies that they want to become like because the brand name is appealing. But if you're a team of 35 people, and you're trying to hire the director of whatever from a huge company, you need to ask the question of, when did this person join that huge company? Did they join when the company was already 5,000 people and from day one they had all the resources at their disposal? Or were they actually one of the earlier employees who helped that growth? Because oftentimes the mistake I see people make is they'll hire someone from an amazing company that have accomplished amazing things, but they're not used to operating with 10% of the resources that they had. So they're not willing to get down and do the dirty work.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:48:35):
And at Deel we have this concept called 'little hands'. I think it's loosely translated from French, someone can correct me on that. But it basically means that no matter who you are, where you sit within the organization, you need to be willing to get into the little things and do the nitty-gritty work and not shy away from it. And it's very important too, whoever we hire at any level, it's like, "Are you willing to do the tiniest of jobs?" And if the answer is yes, that's great. And some people are like, "I would build a team for that." And of course in the future, maybe you should, but that shouldn't be your first answer. Your first answer should be, "Yes, of course I'll do that." And if someone's not excited about that, then they're not a good fit for at least a company at our stage right now.

Lenny (00:49:18):
That is an amazing expression, little hands. You talked about how you check that people are willing to commit to revenue goals. Is that in the interview or is that ... how do you ... because won't everyone just say, "Yeah, yeah, I can commit to anything you need me to commit to, I'm going to go make this work"? How do you get a sense if they're the kind of person that would do that?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:49:38):
It happens within the interview process. So one ways to find out is what are the KPIs that they have committed to in the past in their roles. So if they've never committed to a revenue goal or a bottom funnel goal and they're saying they're willing to commit to it, that's probably not correct. And I always say, if they haven't, I say, "What are the KPIs that you have today and what are the KPIs that you think you should have?" Because sometimes they're just not given those, but they still think they should have been given the more bottom funnel. So that's something that I would look for in the interview process.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:50:06):
And a really good way to also test for that is, this is more on the case study process, but asking someone to come up with a strategy with $0, with $10,000 and maybe a hundred thousand dollars to see if they're going to be able to scale with you. And to see how are they thinking about with different levels of spend and what are they willing to commit to at different levels of spend. Because if someone's throwing up their hands and saying, "At $0, I can only do social media monitoring, we're not going to get much because that's what makes sense." Well, you probably know that they're not going to be comfortable committing to those bottom of funnel metrics until you give them all the resources that they need.

Lenny (00:50:46):
And it sounds like the way you goal teams within Deel also is revenue, growth teams basically have revenue goals. It's not, like you said, leads or traffic or anything like that.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:50:55):
Yes. That's why we're called growth instead of marketing, we care about the revenue growth. And of course we track leads and SQLs. Those are leading indicators to know whether or not we're going to hit the ultimate number that we all care about. But at the end of the day, that's not what we consider success.

Lenny (00:51:12):
In terms of team structure, how you thought about structuring the early growth team, what did that look like and what was the reporting lines and buckets of investment?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:51:21):
Yeah, so very early on, we always seek to bring in one leader to manage a part of the organization and then let them grow their teams. We don't love the idea of hiring people based off of a hypothesis that something is going to work. That's a really good way to have to do layoffs because the plans you thought were going to work didn't work. So we always hired one person, prove out a theory, and then let them grow their team.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:51:43):
So the first hire we made to the team was actually a product marketing person. To this day they lead our product marketing team, and they were the ones who sit between the product team and the go-to-market teams and really set the messaging. And quickly we realized this person needs more help in setting the messaging, the tone. So then the second person we hired was a very talented copywriter. And that person today leads our creative teams.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:52:08):
And then the third person we actually hired onto the growth team was a data analyst because the sentiment was we're not willing to spend a dollar if we don't know where that money's going and what it's doing for us. Which a lot of people would assume that's a very early hire for ... data is too early to hire as number three. But I still think that we did the right thing there. Now we have a whole data team, but back then we didn't.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:52:32):
So those were the three teams that we started with on top. And then the content person was already at Deel by the time that I joined, so that was the person I mentioned that was early employee. So that's how we originally set it.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:52:45):
Now the teams have changed. So now we have a different structure, slightly different structure, which is we have regional teams and functional teams. The functional teams are basically subject matter experts. They're good at what they do and we don't care where they are based in the world. So those are teams like product marketing, content, community, events, paid advertisements, brand. If we are looking for the best graphic designer in the world, I don't care where they are, they can sit wherever in the world. They are basically functional teams.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:53:16):
And then we have regional teams. Because we are selling into a lot of different regions, we need to make sure that we have local expertise as well. So we have marketing managers for different key regions for us that then work with our functional teams to bring the strategy to life. So that's how we've set it.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:53:33):
I've seen businesses who build out a regional team that has their own paid ads team and their own content team. But what we have found is when you take people away from their group of expertise, so if you take a paid ads person, and if you have a team of paid ads people and you separate those five people and give them to different regions, instead of letting them sit together and be a tight team, the best practice is learning and the leveling up of the skills doesn't happen as fast as they would if all of the technical roles are sitting together. So we are continuing down the road of functional and regional setup.

Lenny (00:54:09):
So say someone in Turkey wants to run paid ads, they convince the paid growth team to invest in resources in growing Turkey?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:54:16):
Exactly. So they would work with our central paid ads team to say I would like to run paid ads in Turkey, this is the audience I want to go after. And then they work together to execute on that strategy.

Lenny (00:54:28):
How does that team decide who's going to get their time, is there a rough approach to that?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:54:32):
So it depends on the total addressable market in a region, what are the opportunities we're seeing, what's the competitive landscape like. So chances are if a market is what we consider to be tier one, and it's a place that we have seen good growth, we will invest our resources into it. And then along the way we learn and we decide if we're going to double down or pull back a little bit.

Lenny (00:54:53):
Awesome. I want to chat a bit about culture, culture at Deel. We had Jeff from Ramp on, and their culture is described by one word, velocity. Also one of you being the fastest growing business of all time, I'm curious how you'd contrast your culture and broadly how you think about culture at a startup and how you help create the culture at Deel?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:55:12):
Yeah, so I would say culture is made up of two components. One is, what do you bring to the company as a team member, and what does the company give back to you? So what we expect the team members to bring to us is, our version of velocity is something that we call 'Deel speed', is that we want to make sure that we act with urgency. It doesn't matter how big the team has grown, we want to act with urgency on behalf of our customers. If a customer has a problem, they're not going to wait two weeks to get an answer for that. They're going to get that answer within 24 hours. If we need to build out a product because many customers are asking for it, that product is going to get built in one-tenth the time that any of our competitors will likely build it in.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:55:51):
So 'Deel speed' is very, very important for us. And that's something we expect from our team members who are committing to it. To say, what's the quickest way I can solve this problem properly? And to repeatedly push themselves to act with urgency.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:56:06):
We also care that we remain positive. We have default optimism because we are in a new space, so if someone's going to come into Deel and they're going to be pessimistic and they're like, "I don't think that's going to work for X, Y, Z reasons," they're going to just slow things down. We need people to ask the question of, "I think it's going to work for these four reasons, now let's see what are the risks associated with it and let's seek to solve those risks." That's again something we expect from our team members.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:56:31):
And then the last one, well, not the last one, but one of the third important ones is, fully giving a shit about your customer. At the end of the day, the product that we have, we are dealing with humans, we're dealing with their livelihood, the way they get paid, we're dealing with the way companies hire. It's so incredibly personal if someone doesn't get their paycheck on time or if someone gets into legal trouble because their contract wasn't set up the proper way.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:56:57):
So recognizing that it's not a software and a platform that we're trying to make it the best, but it's like, no, it's a business trying to pay a human so they can live their lives and the business can continue growing. So that care is something that we need people to bring to the table.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:57:14):
Now in return of those things coming, what we give back as a company is, outside of obviously your pay, your benefits package, et cetera, is we offer people the flexibility to choose how and when they do their job, they get to decide on where they work from, what hours they work. So we basically give people all the freedom to set up their life how they want to as long as they come to the table giving us what they need. So I would say we do have an intense culture, and that's expected, we share that openly with people. But at the end of the day, that's also what sets us apart.

Lenny (00:57:48):
I love this 'Deel speed'. Are these core values basically within Deel, these are values that you come back to?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:57:54):
Yes, exactly. And these are values that we publicly share as well.

Lenny (00:57:58):
How early in the lifecycle of the company did you all come up with these values? That's something that a lot of startups think about is, when should we actually crystallize these values?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:58:06):
So we came up with them, I believe it was about a year in, but we didn't sit around the table and say, "What should we call our values?" 'Deel speed' was something that our CEO would tell people. He'd be like, "Okay, I want you to do this, but I want you to do it at 'Deel speed'." And one of the early jokes was, let's have company swag that's Deel speedo and things like that. It's just like, it was already used so frequently with people that we were just like, "Okay, we keep saying this, let's also define what it actually is for us and set it in stone and share it with people." So we did go through that exercise probably about a year in into the company existing, but the culture happened well before we established that.

Lenny (00:58:49):
Reminds me, at Airbnb, there was a team that came up with the core values, I think it was four years in probably, and there were six of them. And then a few years later they realized two of them aren't actually true, they were aspirational. And there was this recognition that values should be who you are not who you hope to be because it just doesn't click. And so they actually cut those values and they ended up having just four values. And maybe one day they'll bring them back. And so I think that's a really good lesson is you want to see who you already are and then just represent them in a really interesting, creative way.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:59:22):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:59:23):
There's a version of, what did you call it, default optimism. Airbnb's version of that was 'embrace the adventure', which is just like, this is going to be crazy, just go for it, embrace it, this is what it's going to be like.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:59:38):
Exactly. And try and see how can I solve this, how can this be done instead of why it won't work.

Lenny (00:59:43):
Yeah, I love that. And this urgency piece comes up again and again in these interviews I'm doing. What I think of is Frank Slootman, I think is his name, the founder of Snowflake, has this book called Amp It Up. All about just how they made Snowflake work. And something he comes back to is just you need to constantly have a sense of urgency because when you don't, people get bored and they actually end up liking their job less because it's just like, I don't really know what I'm doing, things are moving along. And there's actually a lot of value in moving fast. Jeff talked about this as just like, you have less burnout when people feel like things are getting done and out the door.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:00:18):
Yeah, it's incredibly fulfilling. I look back and sometimes things when, for example, when the SVB was going through the issues they were going through, the entire team had to work on a Sunday to communicate with our customers of like, "No, we're good, don't worry about it." But I remember that Sunday I had to miss out on a theater I was so excited to see, but it just felt like, oh my God, we're in this, it was like a war room, we're doing it. And that felt good. I didn't necessarily show up on Monday feeling already burned out, but it was more like, yes, I felt alive. And I think the right people will feel that way.

Lenny (01:00:52):
Yeah, and as long as it's not constantly for years just endless late nights and weekends.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:01:01):
It can't always be war time.

Lenny (01:01:01):
I find that those end up being the most memorable, meaningful moments is when you're working really, really hard on something that you're excited about. And it has to be something you're excited about and are proud of.

Lenny (01:01:10):
Last question. I saw on Twitter, you shared this photo of your home office, and it was this incredible view out the window, and then you took a photo facing your desk and it was an ironing board. And two questions there. One is just how did that all happen? And then two, I think you mentioned somewhere that you didn't even meet a lot of your coworkers for a year and a half after joining Deel, it was very remote forward. So, I'm curious also just how you made remote work work for you in that environment?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:01:36):
Yeah, so I'll explain the ironing board first. So that was because I was actually visiting my family in Istanbul, and in the setup that we have, there's one desk. So my husband and I go rock, paper, scissors, and we'll see who gets the desk and who gets to come up with a secondary solution. And he won the desk, so I had to come up with a creative solution. And because the view behind me was stunning, of the Bosporus, every meeting I joined, people were like, "Wow, I love your view, this is amazing." And I was like, "Oh, no, no, you guys, I'm sitting on an ironing board right now." And to me that was both funny, and I wanted to do a reality check with people to be like, "Come on, this is not as glorious as it looks." But at the same time, it really in that moment I was like, "This is awesome, I work at Deel."

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:02:22):
Previously when I wanted to go visit my family in Istanbul, and I live in Canada, I would have to use my days off to go. And for me it just meant a lot to be able to do my work regardless of where I am. I had a full day of work and meetings and everything. And my work just continued and I was also be able to be with my family. So it was a moment of Deel's promise coming true in a very real way in my life. And I thought it was hilarious. My dad thought it was so unprofessional that I shared that with the public then. He hasn't fully wrapped his head around the startup world. So it was just one of those moments of sharing that, yeah, work can be remote and it can be whatever you want it to be. So that's the the story behind it. In this moment as we're recording this, I am in a proper home office with a desk and a back supported chair. It changes all the time.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:03:16):
And in terms of, going back to your second question of, early days not meeting the team members. As I said, I joined Deel in July, 2020, pandemic was at its peak, me being based in Canada, Canada had very strict restrictions of, you can't leave the country, we won't let you back in. So I had to stay put. And I worked for a year and a half at Deel before for the first time where I met our team members was at a conference in Lisbon. And I showed up and it was this surreal moment because I've worked with them for a year and a half, we'd accomplished so much. Our revenue was already way past $50 million and I was seeing these people for the first time. So that was very funny.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:03:58):
But if I look at the early days of Deel, there's a lot of little stories like that, where we forgot to create swag until we reached a billion dollars. And it was actually when our photo was going to be on the NASDAQ and we wanted to take a team picture that we were like, "Guys, we need to have t-shirts. Can someone please run to a store in New York and print our logo on something?" So a lot of those things just by the nature of being a pandemic business came a little bit later.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:04:25):
But the thing that allowed I think for me in Deel to build the culture early on was, because we all work from home, we've been like that from day one. We have the option to go into WeWorks and co-working spaces if that's something that you choose. But we all get to show up as our very authentic selves. So people have met my pets and my partner well before they would have if I was showing up to an office. So there's that sincerity that comes with being in someone's home that we really relied on early on.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:04:56):
And as a company, I never felt the pressure to show up in a certain way or dress up for meetings or anything. So just being able to show up as yourself, and whether you're an introverted person who never likes to turn on their camera or you're someone who's going to be like, "Here, meet my dog." That just naturally built a team culture and comradery well before we could be together in person.

Lenny (01:05:20):
Clearly it has worked out. Meltem, is there anything else that you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:05:26):
We had a really good conversation. The one thing I would tell people is, most of growth, people assume is very difficult. I'm not necessarily saying it's easy, but it's relatively straightforward when you go back to the first principles of just figuring out where are the people at? How can I add value? As long as your product is there to actually bring them value. So I would say people should just recognize that it's much simpler than they think it is, it just takes a lot of discipline to execute on it, it's not rocket science.

Lenny (01:06:01):
Quite an empowering statement, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:06:07):
I am ready, let's do this.

Lenny (01:06:09):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:06:13):
From the nonfiction world, How Will You Measure Your Life by Clay Christensen, that's one I recommend. He takes the business learnings that he's had and applies it to your life. It's a very short and easy to get through book. Outside of that, I constantly recommend fiction. I think at one point it became uncool to read fiction that every moment you have needs to be productive and you need to learn something. I don't care what fiction it is you read, you can read Judy Blume for all I care, but just read fiction, be creative, do something with your brain other than reading nonfiction and learning things all the time.

Lenny (01:06:48):
I've had to make that shift myself, and it's been great, but I still get drawn to nonfiction. But good reminder. What are some favorite recent movie or TV shows you've loved?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:06:58):
Favorite recent movie, I think along with everybody else, was Oppenheimer. I thought it was great. I do wish they explored a little bit more of why he was the person that drove everybody to excellence. But overall loved the movie. Did not think I could sit through three hours without peeing, but I did. And favorite recent TV show was The Summer I Turned Pretty. I absolutely love it. I don't care that it's actually designed for teenagers, I enjoyed every second of it.

Lenny (01:07:28):
What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:07:28):
What would your siblings say about you? It's very telling. If they have siblings, if they don't, I will say, what will your parents say about you? But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.

Lenny (01:07:41):
What do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:07:45):
I look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll probably shit talk me a lot. And being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, "My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together." That's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, "Oh yeah, they'll say these weird things about me," that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.

Lenny (01:08:11):
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:14):
Oh, this is a dangerous one. So two, one was NuStrips, they're caffeine strips. I find caffeine pills and everything or when I drink coffee is like, accidentally I'll have 300 milligrams and then I'm buzzing. But these are 50 milligrams each, so it's very easy to stop yourself. And they don't taste bad. So those I like for when I just need a little boost.

Lenny (01:08:32):
So they're just strips that you put in your mouth and they give you caffeine?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:32):
Like LISTERINE strips.

Lenny (01:08:36):
What?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:37):
And you put it on your tongue and then it also doesn't give you the jitters and it's just 50 milligrams, which is a very mild cup of coffee.

Lenny (01:08:45):
Microdosing caffeine.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:46):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:08:47):
Beautiful.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:48):
And the second one is, I recently was gifted a personalized library stamp, which I love. Because I love to give books away, so I stamp them with my library stamp. And I like to think that one day in a secondhand bookshop I'm going to run into it.

Lenny (01:09:03):
That's amazing. There's a camp at Burning Man that's a library, and you can borrow books and you have to return it in a year, the next year when you come back to Burning Man. Which is amazing. And then there's a guy that has a megaphone, he is just like, "A book has been returned." Makes a whole scene about it. What is a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with other people, either at work or in life?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:09:27):
The world is run by insecure overachievers. I used to think my insecurity was a downfall and I would just hide it and try to pretend it's not there. And then someone that I really look up to told that to. I'm like, "Okay, so I'm not the only one." And it's just, I do think world is run by a bunch of people that have something to prove for a good reason or not, but it's better to embrace it than to pretend you're all confident and you're just doing this because you're brilliant.

Lenny (01:09:54):
Oh my God, so good. Final question, what is your favorite Canadian food? You live in Canada and thus the question.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:02):
Okay, it's not particularly food, but Caesars, they're basically Bloody Mary's with clam juice.

Lenny (01:10:08):
Oh, Bloody Caesar, is that what they're called? Or just Caesar?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:10):
They're called Caesars.

Lenny (01:10:11):
Just Caesar.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:12):
But the American equivalent would be a Bloody Mary. It's so much better than a Bloody Mary. It's not vegan. And then the reason I qualify it as food is when you order it in Canada, it comes with pepperoni strips and pickled asparagus, and they'll shove a whole meal in there. And it's just amazing and something that America should definitely adapt too.

Lenny (01:10:28):
I think I've had one, I think I prefer Bloody Marys, but a good pitch for the Caesars. Meltem, thank you so much for being here. We talked about growth strategy, team building, 'Deel speed', default optimism, so many things. Really appreciate you making the time. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:49):
So they can reach out to me on Twitter at MeltemK, I'm the fastest to respond there. Please don't reach out to me on LinkedIn, I never respond there. And the way readers can be useful to me is if they, one, we're always looking for feedback on Deel. If you see something out there that you think could be better, let me know, and I'll make sure to communicate it to the team, whatever that may be. And also, if anybody has tips that they think I would benefit from or any good fiction book recommendations, I'm always open to them.

Lenny (01:11:19):
Amazing. Meltem, thank you again so much for being here.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:11:23):
Thank you so much for having me.

# The rise of Cursor: The $300M ARR AI tool that engineers can’t stop using | Michael Truell

## Transcript

Michael Truell (00:00:00):
... our goal with Cursor is to invent a new type of programming, a very different way to build software. So a world kind of after code, I think that more and more being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What is the most counter-intuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor?

Michael Truell (00:00:20):
We definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
What's something that you wish you knew before you got into this role?

Michael Truell (00:00:29):
Many people you hear hire too fast, I think we actually hired too slow to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
You guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year and a half, which is historic. Was there an inflection point where things just started to really take off?

Michael Truell (00:00:43):
The growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential. And exponential to begin with feels fairly slow when the numbers are really low, and it didn't really show off to the races to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
What do you think is the secret to your success?

Michael Truell (00:00:53):
I think it's been...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
Today, my guest is Michael Truell. Michael is co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, the company behind Cursor. If you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of Cursor, it is the leading AI code editor, and is at the very forefront of changing how engineers and product teams build software. It's also one of the fastest growing products of all time, hitting 100 million ARR just 20 months after launching, and then 300 million ARR just two years since launch.

(00:01:22):
Michael's been working on AI for 10 years. He studied computer science and math at MIT, did AI research at MIT and Google, and is a student of tech and business history. As you'll soon see, Michael thinks deeply about where things are heading, and what the future of building software looks like. We chat about the origin story of Cursor, his prediction of what happens after code, his biggest counter-intuitive lessons from building Cursor, where he sees things going for software engineers, and so much more.

(00:01:49):
Michael does not do many podcasts. The only other podcast he's ever done is Lex Fridman, so it was a true honor to have Michael on.

Michael, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Michael Truell (00:04:30):
Thank you. It's great to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:33):
When we were chatting earlier, you had this really interesting phrase, this idea of what comes after code. Talk about that, just the vision you have of where you think things are going in terms of moving from code to maybe something else.

Michael Truell (00:04:45):
Our goal with Cursor is to invent sort of a new type of programming, a very different way to build software, that's kind of just distilled down into you describing the intent to the computer for what you want in the most concise way possible, and really distilled down to just defining how you think the software should work, and how you think it should look. With the technology that we have today, and as it matures, we think you can get to a place where you can invent a new method of building software that's [inaudible 00:05:16] higher level, and more productive, in some cases, more accessible too.

(00:05:21):
And that process will be a gradual moving away from what building software looks like today. I want to contrast it with maybe the vision of what software looks like in the future that I think... A couple of visions that are in a popular consciousness that we at least have some disagreement with. One is, there's a group of people who think that software building in the future is going to look very much like it does today, which mostly means text editing, formal programming languages, like TypeScript, and Go, and C, and Rust. And then there's another group that kind of thinks you're just going to type into a bot, and you're going to ask it to build you something, and then you're going to ask it to change something about what you're building, and it's kind of like this chatbot, Slackbot style where you're talking to your engineering department.

(00:06:10):
And we think that there are problems with both of those visions. I think that on the chatbot style end of things... And we think it's going to look weirder than both. The problem with the chatbot style end of things is that lacks a lot of precision. If you want humans to have complete control over what the software looks like, and how it works, you need to let them gesture at what they want to be changed in a form factor that's more precise than just, "Change this about my app." In a text box, removed from the whole thing. And then the version of the world where nothing changes we think is wrong, because we think the technology is going to get much, much, much better.

(00:06:54):
And so a world after code, I think that it looks like a world where you have a representation of the logic of your software that does look more like English, you have written down... You can imagine in [inaudible 00:07:08] form, you can imagine in kind of an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode. You have written down the logic of the software, and you can edit that at a high level, and you can point at that. And it won't be the impenetrable millions of lines of code, it'll instead be something that's much Terser, and easier to understand, easier to navigate. But that world where the kind of crazy, hard to understand symbols start to evolve towards something that's a little bit more human-readable, and human-editable, is one that we're working towards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
This is a profound point. I want to make sure people don't miss what you're saying here, which is that what you're envisioning in the next year essentially is kind of when things start to shift, is, people move away from even seeing code, having to think in code in JavaScript and Python, and there's this abstraction that will appear, essentially pseudocode, describing what the code should be doing more in English sentences.

Michael Truell (00:07:59):
Yep. We think it ends up looking like that, and we're very opinionated that that path goes through existing professional engineers, and it looks like this evolution away from code. And it definitely looks like the human still being in the driver's seat, and the human having both a ton of control over all aspects of the software and not giving that up. And then also the human having the ability to make changes very quickly, having a fast duration loop and not just having something in the background that's super slow and takes weeks, go do all your work for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):
This begs the question for people that are currently engineers, or thinking about becoming engineers, or designers, or product manager, what skills do you think will be more and more valuable in this world of what comes after code?

Michael Truell (00:08:50):
I think taste will be increasingly more valuable. And I think often when people think about tastes in the realm of software, they think about visuals, or taste over smooth animations, and coloring things, UI, UX, et cetera on the visual design of things. And the visual side of things is an important part of defining a piece of software, but then, as mentioned before, I think that the other half of defining a piece of software is the logic of it, and how the thing works.

(00:09:22):
And we have amazing tools for specing out the visuals of things, and then when you get into the logic of how a piece of software works, really, the best representation we have of that is code right now. You can kind of gesture at it with Figma, and you can gesture at it with writing down notes, but it's when you have an actual working prototype. And so I think that more and more, being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work. It'd be more about the whats, and a little bit less about how exactly you're going to do things under the hood.

(00:09:59):
I think taste will be increasingly important. I think one aspect of software engineering, and we're very far from this right now, and there are lots of funny memes going around the internet about some of the trials and tribulations people can run into if they trust AI for too many things that comes to engineering, around building apps that have glaring deficiencies, and problems, and functionality issues. But I think we will get to a place where you'll be able to be less careful as a software engineer, which, right now, is an incredibly, incredibly important skill. We'll move a little bit from carefulness, and a little bit more towards taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):
This makes me think of vibe coding, is that kind of what you're describing when you talk about not having to think about the details as much, and just kind of going with the flow?

Michael Truell (00:10:49):
I think it's related. I think that vibe coding right now describes exactly this state of creation that is pretty controversial, where you're generating a lot of coding, you aren't really understanding the details. That is a state of creation that then has lots of problems, you don't really... By not understanding the details under the hood right now, you then very quickly get to a place where you're kind of limited at a certain point, where you create something that's big enough that you can't change. And so I think some of the ideas that we're interested around, how do you give people continued control over all the details when they don't really understand the code? I think that solutions there are very relevant to the people who are vibe coding right now. I think that right now, we lack the ability to let the tastemakers actually have complete control over the software. One of the issues also with vibe coding, and letting taste really shine through from people is, you can create stuff, but a lot of it the AI making decisions that are unwieldy and you don't have to control over.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):
One more question along these lines. You threw out this word taste. When you say taste, what are you thinking?

Michael Truell (00:12:01):
I'm thinking having the right idea for what should be built. It will become more and more about effortless translation of, here's exactly what you want built, here's how you want everything to work, here's how you want it to look. And then you'll be able to make that on a computer, and it will less be about this kind of translation layer of, you and your team have a picture of what you'd want to build, and then you have to really painstakingly, labor-intensive, lay out that into a format that a computer can then execute and interpret. I think less than the UI side of things, maybe taste is a little bit of a misnomer, but just about having the right idea for what should be built.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):
Awesome. Okay. I'm going to come back to these topics, but I want to actually zoom us back out to the beginnings of Cursor. I have never heard the origin story, I don't think many people know how this whole thing started. Basically you guys are building one of the fastest growing products in the history of the world, it's changing the way people build products, it's changing careers, professions, it's changing so much. How did it all begin? Any memorable moments along the journey of the early days?

Michael Truell (00:13:05):
Cursor kind of started as a solution search of a problem, and a little bit where it very much came from reflecting on how AI was going to get better over the course of the next 10 years. There were kind of two defining moments, one was being really excited by using the first beta version of Code Pilot, actually. This was the first time we had used an AI product that was really, really, really useful, and was actually just useful at all, and wasn't just a vaporware kind of demo thing.

(00:13:43):
And in addition to being the first AI product that we'd use that was useful, Code Pilot was also one of the most useful, if not the most useful dev tool we'd ever adopted, and that got us really excited. Another moment that got us really excited was the series of scaling on papers coming out of OpenAI and other places that showed that even if we had no new ideas, AI was going to get better and better just by pulling on simple levers, like scaling up the models, and also scaling up the data that was going into the models.

(00:14:12):
And so at the end of 2021, beginning of 2022, this got us excited about how AI products were now possible, this technology was going to mature into the future. And it felt like when we looked around, there were lots of people talking about making models, and it felt like people weren't really picking an area of knowledge work and thinking about what it was going to look like as AI got better and better. And that set us on the path to an idea generation exercise, it was like, "How are these areas of knowledge work going to change in the future as this tech gets more mature? What is the end state of the work going to look like? How are the tools that we use to do that work going to change? How are the models going to need to get better to support changes in the work? And once scaling and pre-training ran out, how are you going to keep pushing for technological capabilities?"

(00:15:07):
And the misstep at the beginning of Cursor is we actually worked on... We sort of did this whole grand exercise, and we decided to work on an area of knowledge work that we thought would be relatively uncompetitive, and sleepy, and boring, and no one would be looking at it, because we thought, "Oh, coding's great, coding's totally going to change with this AI, but people are already doing that." So there was a period of four months to begin with, where we were actually working on a very different idea, which was helping to automate and augment mechanical engineering, and building tools for mechanical engineers.

(00:15:44):
There were problems from the get-go in that. Me and my co-founders, we weren't mechanical engineers. We had friends who were mechanical engineers, but we were very much unfamiliar with the field. So there was a little bit of a blind man and the elephant problem from the get-go. There were problems around, how would you actually take the models that exist to today and make them useful for mechanical engineering? The way we netted out is, you need to actually develop your own models from the get-go. And the way we did that was tricky, and there's not a lot of data on the internet of 3D models of different tools and parts, and the steps that I expect to build up to those 3D models, and then getting them from the sources that have them is also a tricky process too.

(00:16:30):
But eventually what happened was, we came to our senses, we realized we're not super excited about mechanical engineering, it's not the thing we want to dedicate our lives to. And we looked around, and in the area of programming, it felt like despite a decent amount of time ensuing, not much has changed, and it felt like the people that were working on the space maybe had a disconnect with us, and it felt like they weren't being sufficiently ambitious about where everything was going to go in the future, and how all of software creation was going to blow through these models. And that's what set us off on the path to building Cursor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
Okay. So interesting. Okay, so first of all, I love that... This is advice that you often hear of go after a boring industry because no one's going to be there, and there's opportunity. And sometimes it works, but I love that in this journey, it's like, "No, actually, go after the hottest, most popular space, AI coding, app building." And it worked out. And the way you phrased it just now is, you didn't see enough ambition potentially, that you thought there was more to be done. So it feels like that's an interesting lesson. Even if something looks like, "Okay, it's too late, there's GitHub, Code Pilot's out there." Some other products. If you notice that they're just not as ambitious as they could be, or as you are, or you see almost a flaw in their approach, that there's still a big opportunity. Does that resonate?

Michael Truell (00:17:46):
That totally resonates. A part of it is, you need there to be leapfrogs that can happen, you need there to be things that you can do. And I think the exciting thing about AI is, in a bunch of places, and I think this is very much still true of our space, and can talk about how we think about that and how we deal with that, but I think that just the ceiling is really high. And yes, if you look around, probably even if you take the best tool, any of these fields, there should be a lot more that needs to be done over the next few years. Having that space, having that high ceiling, I think is unique amongst areas of software, at least the degree to which it is high with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):
Let's come back to the IDE questions. So there's a few routes you could have taken, and other companies are doing different routes. So there's building an IDE for engineers to work within and adding AI magic to it, there's another route of just a full AI agentic dev product, and then there's just a model that is very good at coding, and focusing on building the best possible coding model. What made you decide and see that the IDE path was the best route?

Michael Truell (00:18:54):
The folks who were from the get-go working on just a model were working on end-to-end automation programming. I think they were trying to build something very different from us, which is, we care about giving humans control over all of the decisions in the end tool that they're building. And I think those folks were very much thinking of a future where end-to-end, the whole thing is done by AI, and maybe the AI is making all the decisions too. And so, one, there was a personal interest component. Two, I think that always, we've tried to be intense realists about where the technology is today, very, very, very excited about how AI is going to mature over the course of many decades. But I think that sometimes people... There's an instinct to see AI do magical things in one area, and then kind of anthropomorphize these models, and think it's better than a smart person here, and so it must be better than a smart person there.

(00:19:55):
But these things have massive issues, and we... From the very start, our product development process was really about dogfooding, and using the tool intensely every day. And we never wanted to ship anything that wasn't useful to us, and we had the benefit of doing that because we were the end users part of our product. And I think that that instills a realism in you around where the tech is right now, and so that definitely made us think that we need the humans to be in the driver's seat, the AI cannot do everything. We're also interested in giving humans that control too for personal reasons, and so that gets you away from just your model company that also gets you away from just this end-end stuff without the human having control.

(00:20:39):
And then the way you get to an IDE versus maybe a plug-in to an existing coding environment is the belief that programming is going to flow through these models, and the active programming is going to change a lot over the course of the next few years. And that the extensibility that existing coding environments have is so, so, so limited, so if you think that the UIs may change a lot, if you think that the form factor programming is going to change a lot, necessarily need to have control over the entire application.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):
I know that you guys today have an IDE, and that's probably the bias you have of this is maybe where the future is heading, but I'm just curious, do you think a big part of the future is also going to be AI engineers that are just sitting in Slack and just doing things for you? Is that something that fits into Cursor one day?

Michael Truell (00:21:20):
I think you'll want the ability to move between all of these things fairly effortlessly, and sometimes I think you will want to have the thing kind of go spin off on its own for a while, and then I think you'll want the ability to pull in the AI's work, and then work with it very, very, very quickly, and then maybe have it go spin off again. And so these kind of background versus foreground form factors, I think you want that all to work well in one place. And I think the background stuff, there's a segment of programming that it's especially useful for, which is type of programming tasks where it's very easy to specify exactly what you want without much description, and exactly what correctness looks like without much description.

(00:22:05):
Bug fixes are a great example of that, but it's definitely not all of programming. So I think that what the IDE is will totally change over time, and our approach to having our own editor was premised on, it's going to have to evolve over time. And I think that that will both include, you can spin off things from different surface areas like Slack, or your issue tracker, or whatever it is, and I think that will also include the pane of glass that you're staring at is going to change a lot. We just mostly think of an IDE as the place where you are building software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
I think something people don't talk enough about with talking about agents and all these AI engineers that are going to be doing all this stuff for you, is basically we're all becoming engineering managers, with a lot of reports that are just not that smart, and you have to do a lot of reviewing, and approving, and specifying. I guess thoughts on that, and is there anything you could do to make that easier? Because that sounds really hard. Anyone that has had a large team, being like, "Oh my god, all these junior people just checking in with me doing not high quality work over and over." It's just like, "What a life. It's going to suck."

Michael Truell (00:23:11):
Yeah. Maybe you [inaudible 00:23:12] one-on-ones with [inaudible 00:23:15].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):
So many one-on-ones.

Michael Truell (00:23:17):
Yeah. So the customers we've seen have most success with AI I think are still fairly conservative about some of the ways in which they use this stuff. And so I do think today, the most successful customers really lean on things like our next edit prediction, where your coding is normal, and making the next into actions you're going to do. And then they also really lean on scoping down the stuff that you're going to hand off to the bot, and for a fixed percent of your time spent reviewing code, from an agent, or from an AI overall, you could... There's two patterns. One is, you could spend a bunch of time specifying things up front, the AI goes and works, and then you then go and review the AI's work, and then you're done. That's the whole task.

(00:24:07):
Or you can really chop things up. So you can specify a little bit, AI writes something, review, specify a little bit, AI writes something, review. Autocompletes all in the way of that spectrum. And still we see often the most successful people using these tools are chopping things up right now, and keeping things fairly [inaudible 00:24:28].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:27):
That sounds less terrible. I'm glad there's a solution here. I want to go back to you guys building Cursor for the first time. What was the point where you realized this is ready? What was a moment of, "Okay, I think this is time to put it out there, and see what happens"?

Michael Truell (00:24:41):
So when we started building Cursor, we were fairly paranoid about spinning for a while, without releasing to the world. And so to begin with too, we actually... The first version of Cursor was hand-rolled. Now we use VS Code as a base, like many browsers use Chromium as a base, and hit foot off of that. To begin with, we didn't, and built the prototype of Cursor from scratch, and that involved a lot of work. We had to build our own... There were a lot of things that go into a modern code editor, including support for many different languages, and navigation support for moving amongst the language, error tracking support for things. There's things like an integrated command line, the ability to use remote servers, the ability to connect to remote servers to view and run code. And so we kind of just went on this blitz of building things incredibly quickly, building our own editor from scratch, and then also the AI components.

(00:25:45):
It was after maybe five weeks that we were living on the editor full-time, and had thrown away our previous editor, and we're using a new one. And then once it got to a point where we found it a bit useful, then we put it in other people's hands, and had this very short beta period. And then we launched it out to the world within a couple of months from the first line of code, I think it was probably three months. And it was definitely a, "Let's just get this out to people and build in public quickly." The thing that took us by surprise is we thought we would be building for a couple hundred people for a long time. And from the get-go, there was an immediate rush of interest, and a lot of feedback too. That was super helpful, we learned from that. That's actually why we switched to being based off of VS Code instead of just this hand-rolled thing. A lot of that was motivated by the initial user feedback, and then had been iterating in public from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:44):
I like how you understated the traction that you got. I think you guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year, year and a half or something like that, which is historic. What do you think was the key to success of something like this? You just talked about dogfooding being a big part of it. You built it in three months, that's insane. What do you think is the secret to your success?

Michael Truell (00:27:12):
The three-month version wasn't very good, and so I think it's been a sustained paranoia about, there are all of these ways in which this thing could get better. The end goal is really to invent a very new form of programming that involves automating a lot of coding, as we know today. And no matter where we are with Cursor, it feels like we're very, very far away from that end goal, there's always a lot to do. A lot of it hasn't been over rotated on that initial push, but instead is the continued evolution of the tool, and just making the tool consistently better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):
Was there an inflection point after those three months where things just started to really take off?

Michael Truell (00:27:51):
To be honest, it felt fairly slow to begin with, and maybe it comes from some impatience on our part. I think there's the overall speed of the growth which continues to take us by surprise. I think one of the things that has been most surprising too is that the growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential, of just consistent month-over-month growth, accelerated at times by launches on our part and other things. But an exponential to begin with feels fairly slow and the numbers are really low, and so it didn't really feel off to the races to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:32):
To me this sounds like build it and they will come actually working. You guys just built an awesome product that you loved yourselves as engineers, you put it out, people just loved it, told everyone about it.

Michael Truell (00:28:42):
It being essentially all just us, the team working on the product, and making the product good in lieu of other things one could spend one's time on. We definitely spent time on tons of other things, for instance, building the team was incredibly important, and doing things like support rotations are very important. But some of the normal things that people would maybe reach for in building the company early on, we really let those fires burn for a long time, especially when it came to things like sales and marketing.

(00:29:15):
And so just working on the product, and building a product that you like first, your team likes, and then also then adjusting it for some set of users, that can kind of sound simple, but then, as you know, it's hard to do that well. And there are a bunch of different directions one could have run in, a bunch of different product directions.

(00:29:35):
I think focus, and strategically picking the right things to build, and prioritizing effectively is tricky. I think another thing that's tricky about this domain is, it's kind of a new form of product building, where it's very interdisciplinary in that we are something in between a normal software company and then a foundation model company, in that we're developing a product for millions of people, and that side of things has to be excellent, but then also one important dimension of product quality is doing more and more on the science, and doing more and more on the model side of things in places where it makes sense. And so that element of things doing that well too has been tricky. The overall thing would note is maybe some of these things sound simple to specify, but doing them well is hard, and they're a lot of different way you can run in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:30):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Speaker 3 (00:30:38):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:40):
So what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, and [inaudible 00:30:46], and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing, and mapping, and integrating CSV in Excel files?

Speaker 3 (00:30:55):
Yes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:22):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema.

Speaker 3 (00:31:30):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record, in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system, and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:51):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co., that's oneschema.co.

(00:32:05):
What is the most counterintuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor, building AI products?

Michael Truell (00:32:11):
I think one thing that's been counterintuitive for us, [inaudible 00:32:14] added a little bit before, but is, we definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development when we started. As mentioned, when we got into this, there were companies that were immediately from the get-go going and just focusing on training model from scratch. And we had done the calculation for what it to train before, and just knew that that was not [inaudible 00:32:36] going to be able to do. And also felt a bit like focusing one's attention in the wrong area, because there were lots of amazing models out there, and why develop all this work to replicate what other players had done. Especially on the pre-training side of things, taking a neural network that knows nothing, and then teaching it the whole internet.

(00:32:55):
And so we thought we weren't going to be doing that at all, and it seems clear to us from the start that the existing models, there were lots of things that they could be doing for us that they weren't doing, because there wasn't the right tool built for them. In fact though, we do a ton of model development, and internally, it's a big focus for us on the hiring front, and have assembled a fantastic team there.

(00:33:18):
And it's also been a big win on the product quality side of things for us. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way. So that was definitely counterintuitive, and surprising, and it's been a gradual thing, where there was an initial use case for training our own model, where it really didn't make sense to use any of the biggest foundation models. That was incredibly successful, moved to another use case that worked really well, and had been going from there. And one of the helpful things in doing this sort of model development is picking your spots carefully, not trying to reinvent the wheel, not trying to focus on places, and maybe where the best foundation models are excellent, but instead kind of focusing on their weaknesses, and how you can complement them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:05):
I think this is going to be surprising to a lot of people hearing that you have your own models. When people talk about Cursor and all the folks in the space, they would kind of call them GPT wrappers, they're just sitting on top of ChatGPT or Sonnet. What you're saying is that you have your own models, talk about just the stack behind the scenes.

Michael Truell (00:34:21):
Yeah, of course. So we definitely use the biggest foundation models a bunch of different ways, they're really important components of bringing the Cursor experience to people. The places where we use our own models, so sometimes it's to survey a use case that a foundation model wouldn't be able to serve at all for cost or speed reasons. And so one example of that is the autocomplete side of things. And so this can be a little bit tricky for people who don't code to understand, but code is this weird form of work, where sometimes, really, the next 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes of your work is entirely predictable from looking over your shoulder.

(00:35:02):
And I would contrast this with writing. So writing, lots of people are familiar with Gmail's autocomplete, and the different forms of autocomplete that show up when you're trying to post text messages, or emails, or things like that. They can only be so helpful, because often, it's just really not clear what you're going to be writing just by looking at what you've written before. But in code sometimes, when you edit a part of a code base, you're going to need to change things, and in other parts of code base, and it's entirely clear how you're going to need to change things.

(00:35:30):
So one core part of Cursor is this really suit to autocomplete experience, where you predict the next set of that you're going to be doing across multiple files, across multiple places within a file. And making models good at that use case, one, there's a speed component of, those models need to be really fast, they need to give you a completion within 300 milliseconds. There's also this cost component of, we're running tons, and tons, and tons of molecules, every keystroke, we need to be changing our prediction for what you're going to do next. And then it's also this really specialty use case of, you need models that are really good, not at completing the next token, just a generic tech sequence, but are really good at autocompleting a series of diffs, looking at what's changed within a code base, and then creating the next set of things that are going to change, both deleted and added and all of that, and we found a ton of success in training models specifically for that task.

(00:36:23):
So that's a place where no foundation models are involved, it's kind of our own thing. We don't have a lot of labeling or branding about this in the app, power is a very core part of Cursor. And then another set of places where a user own models are to help things like Sonnet, or Gemini, or GPT, and those sit both on the inputs of those big models, and on the output. On the input side of things, those models are searching throughout a code base, try to figure out the parts of a code base to show to one of these big models. You can kind of think about this as a mini Google search that's specifically built for finding the relevant parts of the code base to show one of these big models.

(00:37:02):
And then on the output side of things, we take the sketches of the changes that these models are suggesting, you make with that code base. And then we have models that then fill in the details of, the high level thinking is done by the smartest models, they spend a few tokens on doing that, and then these smaller specialty incredibly fast models, coupled with some inference tricks, then take those high level changes and turn them actually into full code diffs. And so it's been super helpful for pushing on quality in places where you need a specialty task, and it's been super helpful for pushing on speed, which is such an important dimension of product quality for us too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
This is so interesting. I just had Kevin Weil on the podcast, CPO of OpenAI, and he calls this the ensemble of models, that's the same way-

Michael Truell (00:37:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:46):
... they work, to use the best feature of each one, and to your point, the cost advantages of using cheaper models. These other models, are they based on Llama and things like that, just open source models that you guys plug into and build on?

Michael Truell (00:38:00):
Yeah. So again, we try to be very pragmatic about the place that we're going to do this work, and we don't want to reinvent the wheel. And so starting from the very best pre-trained models that exist out there, often open source ones, sometimes in collaboration with these big model providers that don't share their weights out into the world, because the thing we care about last is the ability to read line by line, the matrix of weights that then go to give you a certain output. We just care about the ability to train these things, to post-train them. And so by and large, yes, open source models, sometimes working with the closed source providers too to tune things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
This leads to a discussion that a lot of AI founders always think about and investors, which is moats, and defensibility in AI. So it feels like one is custom models, is a moat in the space. How do you just think about long-term defensibility in the space, knowing there's other folks, as you said, launching constantly trying to eat your lunch?

Michael Truell (00:39:03):
I think that there are ways to build in inertia and traditional moats, but I think by and large, we're in a space where it is incumbent on us to continue to try to build the best thing, and everyone in this industry. And I truly just think that the ceiling is so high that no matter what entrenchment you build, you can be leapfrogged. And I think that this resembles markets that are maybe a little bit different from normal software markets, normal enterprise markets of the past. I think one that comes to mind is the market for search engines at the end of 1999, or at the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s. I think another market that comes to mind that resembles this market in many ways, it's actually just the development of the peripheral computer and many computers in the '70s, '80s, '90s.

(00:40:03):
And I think that, yes, in each of those markets, the ceiling was incredibly high, it was possible to swish. You could keep getting value for the incremental hour of a smart person's time, the incremental R&D dollar for a really long time, you wouldn't run out of useful things to build. And then in search in particular, not on the computer case, adding distribution was helpful for making the product better too, in that you could tune the algorithms, you could tune the learning based off of the data and the feedback you're getting from users. And I think that all of those dynamics exist in our market too. And so I think maybe the sad truth for people like us, but then the amazing truth for the world is, I think that there are many leapfrogs that exist, there's more useful things to build. We're a long way away from where we can compete in 5, 10 years, and it's incumbent in our state to keep that going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:55):
So what I'm hearing, this sounds like a lot more like a consumer sort of moat, where it's just, be the best thing consistently so that people stick with you versus creating lock-in and things like that, where they're just... Like Salesforce, where it's just contracts with the entire company, and you have to use this product.

Michael Truell (00:41:10):
Yeah. I think the important thing to note is, if you're in a space where you run out of useful things to do very quickly, then that's not a great situation to be in. But if you're in a place where big investments, and having more and more great people working on the right path can keep giving you value, then you can get these economies of scale of R&D, and you can deeply work on the technology in the right direction, and get to a place where that is defensible. But yes, it is... I think there's a consumer-like tendency to it, and I really think it's just about building the best thing possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):
Do you think in the future there's one winner in this space, or do you think it's going to be a world of a number of products like this?

Michael Truell (00:41:53):
I think the market is just so very big. You asked about the IDE thing early on, and one thing that I think a trip of some people that were thinking about the space is, they looked at the IDE market of the past 10 years, and they said, "Who's making money off of the editors?" It's this super fragmented space where everyone kind of has their own thing, with their own figuration, and there's one company that actually makes money off making great editors, but that company is only so big. And then the conclusion was, it was going to look like that in the future. And I think that the thing that people missed was that there was only so much you could do building an editor in the 2010s for coders, and the company that made money off of editors was doing things like making it easy to navigate around a code base, and doing some error checking and type checking for things, and having good debugging tools.

(00:42:57):
Which were all very useful, but I think that the set of things you can build for programmers, I think the set of things you can build for knowledge workers in many different areas just goes very far and very deep. The problem in front of all of us is the automation of a lot of busy work and knowledge work, and really changing all the areas of knowledge work in front of us to be much higher level and more productive.

(00:43:19):
So that was a long-winded way to say, I think the market's really, really big that we're in. I think it's much bigger than people have realized than the other building tools for developers in the past. And I think that there will be a bunch of different solutions. I think that there will be one company, to be determined if it's going to be us, but I do think that there will be one company that builds the general tool that builds almost all the world's software, and that will be a very, very generationally big business. But I think that there will be kind of niches you can occupy in doing something for a particular segment of the market, or for a very particular part of the software development life cycle. But the general programming shifts from just writing formal programming languages to something way higher level. This is the application you purchase and use to do that. I think that there will be generally one winner there, and it will be a very big business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):
Juicy. Along those lines, it's interesting that Microsoft was actually at the center of this first, with an amazing product, amazing distribution, Copilot you said was the thing that got you over the hump of, "Wow, there could be something really big here." And it doesn't feel like they're winning, it feels like they're falling behind. What do you think happened there?

Michael Truell (00:44:34):
I think that there are specific historical reasons why Copilot might not have lived up... So far have lived up to the expectations that some people have for it, and then I think that there are structural reasons. I think the structural reason is... And to be clear, Microsoft, in the Copilot case, obviously a big inspiration for our work, and in general, I think they do lots of awesome things, and we're users of many Microsoft products, but I think that this is a market that's not super friendly to incumbents, in that a market that's friendly to incumbents might be one where there's only so much to do, it kind of gets commoditized fairly quickly, and you can bundle that in with other products, and where the ROI between different products is quite small. And in that case, perhaps it doesn't make sense to buy the innovative solution, it makes sense to just kind of buy the thing that's bundled in with other stuff.

(00:45:31):
Another market that might be particularly helpful for incumbents is one where there's... From the get-go, you have your stuff in one place, and it's really, really excruciatingly hard to switch, and for better or for worse. I think in our case, you can try out different tools, and you can decide which product you think is better. And so that's not super friendly to incumbents, and that's more friendly to whoever you think is going to have the most innovative product. And then the specific historical reasons, as I understand them are the group of people that worked on the first version of Copilot have, by and large, gone on to do other things at other places. I think it's been a little hard to coordinate among all the different departments and parties that might be involved in making something like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):
I want to come back to Cursor. A question I like to ask everyone that's building a tool like this, if you could sit next to every new user that uses Cursor for the first time, just whisper a couple tips in their ear to be more successful, most successful with Cursor, what would be 1 or 2 tips?

Michael Truell (00:46:32):
I think right now, and we'd want to fix this at a product level, a lot of being successful with Cursor is kind of having a taste for what the models can do, both what complexity of a task they can handle, and how much you need to specify things to that model, but having a taste for the quality of the model, and where its gaps exist, and what it can do and what it can't. And right now, we don't do a good job in the product of educating people around that, and maybe giving people some swim lanes, giving people some guidelines.

(00:47:06):
But to develop that taste, would give two tips. So one is, as mentioned before, would bias less toward, trying in one go to tell the model, "Hey, here's exactly what I want you to do." Then seeing the output, and then either being disappointed or accepting the entire thing for an entire big task. Instead what I would do is I would chop things up into bits, and you can spend basically the same amount of time specifying things overall, but chopped up more. So you're specifying a little bit, you're getting a little bit of work, you're specifying a little bit, getting a little bit of work, and not doing as much the, "Let's write a giant thing telling the model exactly what to do." I think that will be a little bit of a recipe for disaster right now.

(00:47:48):
And so biasing toward chopping things up. At the same time, and it might make sense to do this on a side project and not on your professional work, I would encourage people to, especially developers who are used to existing workflows for building software, I would encourage people to explicitly try to fall on their face, and try to discover the limits of what these models can do by being ambitious in a safe environment, like perhaps a side project, and trying to kind of go around town, use AI to the fullest. Because a lot of the time, we run into people who haven't given the AI yet a fair shake, and are underestimating its abilities. So generally biasing towards chopping things up and making things smaller, but to discover the limits of what you can do there, explicitly just try to go for broke in a safe environment, and get a taste for... You might be surprised in some of the places where the model doesn't break.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:45):
What I'm essentially hearing is build a gut feeling of what the model can do, and how far it can take an idea versus just kind of guiding it along. And I bet that you need to rebuild this gut every time there's a new model launch, when it's on... I don't know, 4.0 comes out, you have to do this again. Is that generally right?

Michael Truell (00:49:04):
Yes. For the past few years, it hasn't been as big as I think the first experience people have had with some of these big models. This is also a problem we would hope to solve much better just for users, and take the burden off of them. But each of these things have slightly different quirks and different personalities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
Along these lines, something that people are always debating tools like Cursor, are they more helpful to junior engineers, or are they more helpful to senior engineers? Do they make senior engineers 10X better? Do they make junior engineers more like senior engineers? Who do you think benefits most today from Cursor?

Michael Truell (00:49:43):
I think across the board. Both of these cohorts benefit in big ways. It's a little hard to say on the relative ranking. I will say, they fall into different anti-patterns. The junior engineers we see going a little too wholesale, relying on AI for everything, and we're not yet in a place where you can kind of do that end-to-end on a professional tool, working with tens, hundreds of other people within a long-lived code base. And then the senior engineers... For many folks, it's not true for all, and we actually often... One of the ways these tools are adopted is, there's developer experience teams within companies, often those are staffed by incredibly senior people, because often, those are people who are building tools to make the rest of the engineers within an organization more productive.

(00:50:33):
And we've seen some very, very boundary pushing kind of... We've seen people who are on the front lines of really trying to adopt the technology as much as possible there. But by and large, I would say on average, as a group, the senior engineers underrate what AI can do for them, and stick to their existing workflows. And so the relative ranking is a little hard, I think they fall into different anti-patterns, but they both, by and large, yet get big benefits with these tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:04):
That makes absolute sense. I love that it's two ends of the spectrum, expect too much, don't expect enough. It's like the three bears allegory.

Michael Truell (00:51:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):
Yeah. Okay.

Michael Truell (00:51:18):
Yeah. Maybe the sort of senior, but not staff, right in the middle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):
Interesting. Okay. Just a couple more questions. What's something that you wish you knew before you got into this role? If you could go back to Michael at the beginning of Cursor, which was not that long ago, and you could give him some advice, what's something that you would tell him?

Michael Truell (00:51:38):
The tough thing with this is, it feels like so much of the hard-won knowledge is tacit, and a bit hard to communicate verbally. And the sad fact of life feels like for some areas of human endeavor, you kind of do need to fall on your face to... Either need to fall on your face to learn the correct thing, or you need to be around someone who's a great example of excellence in the thing. And one area where we have felt this is hiring. I think that we actually were... So we tried to be incredibly patient on the hiring front.

(00:52:20):
It was really important to us that, both for personal reasons and also for, I think actually for the company's strategy, having a world-class group of engineers and researchers to work on Cursor with us was going to be incredibly important. Also, getting people who fit... A certain mix of intellectual curiosity and experimentation, because there can be so many new things we need to build. And then also an intellectual honesty, and maybe micro-pessimism, bluntness, because if all the noise, and... Especially as the company's grown, and the business has grown, keeping a level head I think is incredibly important too.

(00:52:59):
But getting the right group of people into the company was the thing that maybe more than anything else, apart from building the product, we really, really fussed over. We actually waited a long time to grow the team because of that. And I think that many people you hear hired too fast, think we actually hired too slow to begin with. I think it could have been remedied, I think we could have been better at it.

(00:53:28):
And the method of recruiting that we ended up eventually falling into and working really well for us, which isn't that novel, of going after people that we think are really world-class, and recruiting them over the course of, in some cases, many years, ended up working for us in the end, but I don't think we were very good at it to begin with. And so I think that there were hard-won lessons around both who was the right profile, who actually made sense in that team, what did greatness look like, and then how to talk with someone about the opportunity, and get them excited if they really weren't looking for anything. There were lots of learnings there about how to do that well, and that took us a bit of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:12):
What are some of those learnings for folks that are hiring right now? What's something you missed or learned?

Michael Truell (00:54:18):
I think to start with, maybe we actually biased a little bit too much towards looking for people who fit the archetype of well-known school, very young, had done the things that were high credential in those well-known school environments. And actually, I think found... Were lucky early on to find fantastic people who are willing to do this with us who were later careered. I think we should kind of spent a bunch of time on maybe a little bit the wrong profile to begin with, and part of that was a seniority thing. Part of that was kind of an interest and experience thing too, we have hired people who are excellent, excellent, excellent and very young, but they maybe look in some cases slightly different from being straight out of central casting.

(00:55:12):
Another lesson is just, we very much evolved our interview loop, and so now, we have a hand-rolled set of interview questions, and then core our... Core to how we interview too, is actually, we have people onsite for two days, and do a project with us, a work test project. And that has worked really well, that increasingly you're finding that. I think how to learn about what people are interested in, and put our best foot forward, and letting them know about the opportunity when they're really not looking for anything, and have those conversations. There's definitely been... Gotten better at that over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:53):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Michael Truell (00:55:56):
I think this two-day work test which we thought would not scale past a few people has had surprising staying power. And the great thing about it is, it lets someone go end-to-end on it like a real project. It's not work that we use, it's canned list of projects. But it gives you two days of seeing a real work product, and it doesn't have to be incredibly time-enhancing other teams from time. You can take the time you would spend in a half day or one day onsite, and you kind of spread it out over those two days, and give someone a lot of time to do work on their projects, and so that can actually help it scale.

(00:56:38):
It helps to enforce, do you want to be around this person type test, because you are around this person for two days, a bunch of meals with them. We didn't expect that one to stick around, but that has been really, really important to our value to process, and then also important to getting people excited at, especially the very early stages of the company. Because before, people are using the product, and know about it. And when the product is comparatively not very good, really, the only thing you have going for you is a team of people that some people find special and want to be around. And the two days would give us a chance to just have this person meet us, and in some cases, hopefully get convinced that they want to throw in with us. That one was unexpected. Not exactly an interview question, but kind of like a forward interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
The ultimate interview question. So just to be very clear about what you're describing, you give them an assignment, like, "Build this feature in our actual code base, work with the team to code it and ship it." Is that roughly right?

Michael Truell (00:57:40):
Yes. So we don't use the IP, not shift end-to-end, but it's like a mock... Very often in our code base, "Here's a real mini two-day project. You're going to do it end-to-end." Largely being left alone, there's collaboration too. And then we're a pretty imprisoned company, in almost all cases, it's actually just sitting in office with us too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
And you've been saying that this has scaled to even today, so how big are you guys at this point?

Michael Truell (00:58:07):
So we are going on 60 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:10):
So small for the scale and impact. I was thinking it'd be a lot larger than that.

Michael Truell (00:58:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:16):
And I imagine the largest percent is engineers?

Michael Truell (00:58:19):
Yeah. To be clear, a big part of the work ahead of us is building a group of people that is bigger, and awesome, and can continue to make the product better, and the service we give to customers better. And so you don't plan to stay that small for longer, wouldn't hope so. But part of the reason that that number is small is, the percentage of engineering and research and design is very high within the company, and so many software companies when they have roughly 40 engineers would be over 100 people, because there's lots of operational work, and often, they're very, very sales-led from the get-go, and that's just quite labor-intensive. And here, we started from a place of being incredibly lean in product-led, and we now serve lots of our market customers, and it built that out, but there's much more to do there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:10):
A question I wanted to ask you, there's so much happening in AI, there's things launching every... There's newsletters, many newsletters, whose entire function is to tell you what is happening in AI every single day. Running a company that's at the center, the white-hot center of this space, how do you stay focused, and how do you help your team stay focused, and heads down, and just build and not get distracted by all these shiny things?

Michael Truell (00:59:35):
I think hiring is a big part of it, and if you get people with the right attitude. All of this should be asterisked in, I think we're doing well there, I think that we'd probably be doing better there too, and it's something that we should probably talk even more about as a company. But I think that hiring people with the right disposition, people who are less focused on external validation, more focused on building something really great, more focused on doing really high quality work, and people who are just generally level-headed, and maybe the highs aren't very high, the lows aren't very low. I think hiring can get you through a lot here, and I think that's actually a learning throughout the company, is that for any... You need process, you need hierarchy, you need lots of things, but for any kind of organizational tool that you're introducing into a company, the result you're looking to get from that tool also... You can go pretty far on hiring people with the right behaviors that you want to resolve from that for organizational thing.

(01:00:39):
And the specific example that comes to mind is, we've been able to get away with not a ton of process yet on the engineering front, and I think we need a little bit more process, but for our size, not a ton of process, by hiring people who I think are really excellent. One is hiring people that are level-headed. I think two is just talking about it a lot. I think three is hopefully leading by example. And for us personally, we've since 2021, 2022 been professionally working on this, and been working on AI, and we've just seen a sea change of the comings and goings of various technologies and ideas of... If you're to transport yourself back to end of 2021, beginning of 2022, this is GPT-3, Instruct GPT doesn't exist, there's no Dolly, there's no stable diffusion. And then we've gone through all of those image technologies existing, ChatGPT and that rise, and GPT-4, all of these new models, all these different modalities, all the video stuff, and only a very small number of these things really kind of affects the business.

(01:01:45):
So I think we've kind of just built up a little bit of an immune system, and know when an event comes around that actually is really going to matter for us. This dynamic too of there being lots, and lots, and lots of chatter, but then maybe only a few things that really matter, I think has been mirrored in AI over the last decade, where there have been so many papers on deep learning in academia, so many papers on AI in academia, then the amazing thing is there are really a lot of... A lot the progress of AI can be attributed to some very simple elegant ideas that have stayed around, and the vast majority of ideas that have been put out there haven't had staying power, and haven't mattered a ton. And so the dynamic is a little bit mirrored in the evolution of deep learning as a field overall.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:33):
Last question. What do you think people still most misunderstand, or maybe don't fully grasp about where things are heading with AI in building in the way the world will change?

Michael Truell (01:02:46):
People are still a little bit occupied too much, either end of a spectrum of it's all going to happen very fast, and this is all bluster, and hype, and snake well, and I think we're in the middle of a technology shift that's going to be incredibly consequential. I think it's going to be more consequential than the internet, I think it's going to be more consequential than any shift in tech that we've seen since the advent of computers. And I think it's going to take a while, and I think it's going to be a multi-decade thing, and I think many different groups will be consequential in pushing it forward.

(01:03:24):
And to get to a world where computers can increasingly do more, and more, and more for us, there's all of these independent problems that need to be knocked down, and progress needs to be made on them, and some of those are on the science side of things of getting these models to understand different types of data, be faster, cheaper, smarter, conform to the modalities that we care about, take actions in the real world. And then some of it's on how we're going to work with them, and what's the experience that a human should actually be seeing and controlling on a computer, and working with these things.

(01:03:58):
But I think it's going to take decades. I think that there's going to be lots of amazing work to do. I think that also, one of the most... A pattern of a group that I think will be especially important here, not to talk our own book, but I think is the company that works on automating and augmenting a particular area of knowledge work, builds both the technology under the surface for that, integrating the best parts from providers, sometimes doing it in-house, and then also builds the product experience for that. I think people who do that, and... We're trying to do it in software, people do that in other areas, I think those folks will be really, really, really consequential. Not just for the end value that users see, but then I think as they get to scale, they'll be really important for pushing forward the technology, because I think they'll be able to build... The most successful of them will be able to build very, very big businesses. So, excited to see the rise of other companies like that in other areas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:59):
I know you guys are hiring. For folks that are interested in, "Hey, I want to go work here, and build this sort of stuff." What kind of roles are you looking for right now? Anyone specifically you're trying... Any roles you're most excited about filling ASAP? What should people know if they're curious?

Michael Truell (01:05:12):
There are so many things that this group of people need to do that we are not get equipped to do. Generic across the board, first of all, and so if you don't think we have a role for something, maybe you should reach out, that won't actually be the case. And maybe we can actually learn from you, and decide that we need something that we weren't yet aware of. But by and large, I think that two of the most important things for us to do this year are have the best product in the space, and then grow it. And we're kind of in this land grab mode, where almost everyone in the world is either using no tool like ours, or they're using one that's maybe developing less quickly. So growing Cursor too is a big goal, and I would say, especially always on the hunt for folks who... Excellent engineers, designers, researchers, but then folks all across the business side too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):
I can't help but ask this question now that you talk about engineers, there's this question of just, "AI's going to write all our code." But everyone's still hiring engineers like crazy. All the foundational models, so many open roles.

Michael Truell (01:06:28):
Yeah. We're not out there tooting the horn of, people can learn to code.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):
Do you think there's going to be an inflection point of engineering roles start to slow down? I know this is a big question, but just... Do you see engineers being more and more needed across all these companies, or do you think at some point there's all these Cursor agents running building for us?

Michael Truell (01:06:45):
Again, we have the view that there's this both long messy middle of it not jumping to a, just you step back, and you ask for all your stuff to be done, and you have your engineering department. And very much, you want to evolve from programming as it exists today, we want humans to be in the driver's seat, and we think even in the end state, that's giving folks control over everything is really important, and you will need professionals to do that, and decide what the software looks like.

(01:07:18):
So both I think that, yes, engineers are definitely needed. I think that engineers will be able to do much more. I think the demand for software is very lasting, which is not the most novel thing, but I think it's kind of crazy to think about how expensive and labor-intensive it is to build things that are pretty simple and easy to specify, or it would look like it to the outside observer, and just how hard those things are to do right now.

(01:07:49):
All of the stuff that exists right now that's justified by the cost and demand that we have now, if you could bring that down by [inaudible 01:07:56], I think you would have tons, and tons, and tons of more stuff that we could do in our computers, tons more tools. And I've felt this, where... One of my early jobs actually was working for a biotechnology company, and it was building internal tools for them, and the off-the-shelf tools that existed were horrible, and did not fit their use case at all. And then the internal tools I was building, there was definitely a ton of demand there for things that could be built, and that far outstripped just the things that I could build in the time that I was with them.

(01:08:29):
The physics of working on computers are so great, you should be able to basically just move everything around, do everything that you want to do. There's still so much friction, I think that there's much more demand for software than what we can build today with things costing like a blockbuster movie to make simple productivity software. And so I think long into the future, yes, there will actually be more demand for engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):
Is there anything that we didn't cover that you wanted to mention? Any last nugget wisdom you wanted to leave listeners with? You could also say no, because we've done a lot.

Michael Truell (01:09:00):
We think a lot about how you set up a team to be able to make new stuff, in addition to continuing to improve the stuff that you have right now. And I think if we were to be successful, IDE is going to have to change a ton, [inaudible 01:09:18] looks like is going to have to change a ton going into the future. And if you look around, the companies we respect, there are definitely examples of companies that have continued to really ride the wave of many leapfrogs, and continue to actually push the frontier. But they're kind of rare too, it's a hard thing to do. So part of that is just kind of thinking about the thing, and trying to reflect on it in our good days, and the first principle side of things, part of it's also trying to get in and study past examples of greatness here, and that's something that we think about a lot too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:00):
Yeah. Yeah. Before we started recording, you had all these books behind you, and I was like, "What's that over there?" It's the history of some old computer company that was influential in a lot of ways that I've never heard of. And I think that says a lot about you of, where a lot of this innovation comes from, is studying the past, and study history, and what's worked and what hasn't.

(01:10:19):
Okay. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe apply? You said that there may be roles they may not even be aware of, where do they go find that, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Michael Truell (01:10:28):
Yeah. If folks are interested in working on this stuff, would love to speak, they can find... If they go to cursor.com, they can kind of both find the product and find out how to reach us.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:41):
Easy. Michael, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.

Michael Truell (01:10:44):

# Vision, conviction, and hype: How to build 0 to 1 inside a company | Mihika Kapoor (Product, Figma)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I asked on Twitter, "Who's the best product manager you've worked with?" You were the most mentioned.

Mihika Kapoor (00:00:04):
My take is that your scope is the world. Nothing should ever perceive as being out of bounds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:10):
VP of product at Figma told me, "Mahika is really great at creating a vision and getting people to see what she sees."

Mihika Kapoor (00:00:16):
We lean heavily into designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light. If you and your team do your job correctly, what does the world look like?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
Say somebody wants to make their culture more entrepreneurial, what does it take?

Mihika Kapoor (00:00:31):
We have this concept called Maker Week, which is our internal hackathon, giving people the breathing space to see ahead into the horizon and be wildly ambitious.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
Today, my guest is Mahika Kapoor. Mahika is a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, where she was an early PM on FigJam, and is now spearheading development of a new product that the company's going to launch in June. She's known as the go-to person at Figma for leading new zero-to-one products. And as you'll hear in our conversation, is beloved by everybody that works with her. Prior to Figma, Mahika founded Design Nation, a national nonprofit that democratizes undergraduate student access to a design education, and led several products and launches at Meta, focused on commerce and creators.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:16):
On this podcast, I bring on a lot of amazing senior product leaders, but there's so much we can learn from stellar on-the-ground product managers like Mahika. In our conversation, we drill into many of the skills that Mahika has cultivated that have contributed to her success, including how to develop a compelling vision, get buy-in for your ideas, how to develop conviction, empathy, the importance of culture, and how to create a culture on your team and within the company, and also how to deal with the constant change that happens within successful organizations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:47):
We also spent a bunch of time on how to effectively bring new ideas in your company from zero to one to launch, including getting to a bunch of the stories behind some of Figma's most successful products and features, and how many of them began at hackathons and Maker Weeks. Mahika is a truly special product manager and leader, and I feel fortunate to have had this chance to learn from her. We went quite long on this conversation, but honestly, this could have gone for another two hours. With that, I bring you Mahika Kapoor, after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:29):
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the embedded integration platform for B2B SaaS product development teams. Are your users constantly requesting new integrations with other SaaS platforms that they use? Unfortunately, native product integrations take months of engineering to build, and the maintenance never ends. Paragon enables your engineering team to ship integrations seven times faster than building in-house by removing the complexities around authentication, messy third-party APIs, and debugging integration errors. Engineering teams at companies like Copy.ai, Cinch, TLDB, and over 100 other SaaS companies are using Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result? Their shipping integrations on demand, which has led to higher product usage, better retention, and more customer upsells. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you go to market faster with integrations today. That's useparagon. com/lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:33):
This episode is brought to you by Lenny's Job Board. As many of you may or may not know, for the past couple of years I've been running a recruiting service. I've introduced over 30 companies to their next hire and helped build a candidate pipeline for tons more. I've been fortunate to work with companies like Ramp, Figma, Shopify, many more, plus a bunch of exciting young startups connecting each to extremely talented engineers, designers, and product leaders that make up my community. Because of its success and the value that it's driven to companies and to people looking for jobs, we're ramping up the service in a big way. I'm beta testing a bespoke headhunting style service and I'm opening up a handful of slots. We work with a select group of companies each month. If you need to make a key product hire or quickly expand your team, I'd love to see if I can help head to Lennysjobs.com/talent and hit meet candidates to get started lennysjobs.com/talent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:29):
Mahika, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Mihika Kapoor (00:04:33):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. I am a huge fan of the podcast and really excited to be chatting today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:39):
Just to set expectations, this is going to be a Mahika love-fest podcast. And what I want to try to do with our time here is have an archeology of Mahika to understand what you've learned about product and building product, in particular because you are thriving at Figma, which is one of the most interesting and successful tech companies in the world with one of the best product teams in the world. So, basically, I just want to learn as much as I can from what you've learned and what you've done in order to create more Mahikas in the world. That's kind of my goal here because I feel like that would [inaudible 00:05:11].

Mihika Kapoor (00:05:11):
Mildly frightening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):
In a very cool way, not in a creepy way. So, what I did to prep for this conversation is I, as I said, reached out to a bunch of your colleagues at Figma to ask what you're especially strong at. And what I want to do is kind of go through some of these key skills, and they're essentially the core attributes of great product managers and learn from you, learn from what you learned about how doing these things well, and just what you do to be successful at these things. How does that sound?

Mihika Kapoor (00:05:40):
That sounds good. One thing to call out is that I think when I think about my own PM style, it's definitely not a tick-all-the-boxes style. There are plenty of things that I'm very bad at that PMs are traditionally supposed to be great at, so happy to chat about what makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:59):
Okay, that's actually really cool. So, let's save that for the end, the things you think you're bad at. The way I see this is a reverse performance review. Here's all the things you're amazing at, let's just go spend all our time on that. But I think that's going to be really important. But just along those lines, what I'm hearing is there's a sense of do the things you are good at really well. This is a trend on the podcast, is lean into your strengths. Is that the way you see it? Do you have thoughts along those lines of just the fact that you've been successful, knowing you have these things you're not amazing at? Then we'll talk.

Mihika Kapoor (00:06:27):
It's important to have two things. One is of course lean into your strengths. I think that PMing is traditionally a sort of generalist role and people fall into it in a number of ways. But most often than not, I hear people fall into it by trying a bunch of other things and then realizing that, "Oh, hey, maybe this PM thing makes more sense for me." So, for me personally, it was I have always been a very left brain, right brain kind of a person. I majored in CS and minored in visual arts. And when I worked as a software engineer, I really missed the design side, and when I worked as a designer, I missed the technical. And moving into product was a really great way to kind of straddle both and have more touch points across the product development cycle. And so, I think that based on how you fell into it, you might have different spikes and different strengths and leaning into those is really important. But for the other things, it's also of course important to have a growth mindset and to constantly be conquering what comes next.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:32):
Okay, cool. Okay, so I'll save the stuff you think you're bad at for later. Let's start with the stuff you're basic at. Okay. So, the first is vision. So, Sho Kuwamoto, VP of product at Figma told me that, "Mahika is really great at creating a vision and getting people to see what she sees. She's working on a new project now and put together one of the best pitches I've ever seen internally at what it could become, why it'd be differentiated, et cetera. And like every new project, this had up and downs, but she's incredibly driven to keep the flame alive throughout these ups and downs." Can you just talk about what you've learned about doing this well, creating a compelling vision, getting people excited, getting buy-in for big ideas?

Mihika Kapoor (00:08:12):
Yeah, absolutely. So, my take is that vision is everything. It is really important to create a vision that you believe in, that your team believes in and that your company believes in. Because the reality of the product development cycle is that it's so messy, it's so chaotic. You're going to have extreme highs and extreme lows. You're going to march in a certain direction only to hear from your users that it might just be the wrong direction, and totally pivot. And in order to ensure that moments that are not discouraging, but rather, learning opportunities for your team team, it's so important to be anchored on that singular vision because then any step along the way feels like forward progress.

Mihika Kapoor (00:09:03):
So, first, just want to underscore the importance of having that vision and that perspective on if you and your team do your job correctly what does the world look like? In terms of crafting a compelling vision, I think that there's sort of a few aspects. The first is that you cannot go into a vacuum and come out with a compelling vision that does not exist. You have to be fundamentally inseparable from your users, and also, fundamentally inseparable from your team. And so, I think that there is sort of this important cross-pollination of functions that is really important in crafting a compelling vision. You want to always ensure that there are research insights that help you feel what a user is feeling. You want to ensure that there are beautiful designs and prototypes that help communicate what this future world looks like, and you also want to root it in engineering and feasibility. And you want to be constantly, even in the vision phase, assuring that what you're marching after is something that is achievable and something that you can work towards.

Mihika Kapoor (00:10:21):
And so, I think a lot of folks when they think about visioning, they kind of think about, "Okay, how do we start from scratch and learn about the user and then translate that into designs and then translate that into engineering?" And it becomes this very almost linear process. And I think that to the extent that you can have this cross-pollination of ideas and people working together, that leads to a really strong vision. And there's this book that I love called The Medici Effect, which basically talks about how when people come from different places and you have that confluence of ideas, that leads to innovation at the end of the day.

Mihika Kapoor (00:10:56):
The second piece is, okay, once you have your vision, once you have talked to your users and built up your perspective and things like that, it's like how do you communicate it internally and how do you help everyone around you see what you're seeing? And I think something that's really unique about Figma is that it is a fundamentally very, very detail-oriented culture. And it's also a company that very much practices what it preaches in terms of the future being visual communication. And so, I've found that words will only get you so far. So, when I put together a vision with my team at Figma, it's all about not just your traditional, "Okay, here are pain points. And then, here are solutions. And then, here is the timeline and costing." But rather how can you bring all of those things together and how can a vision pitch effectively be pain point, solution, proof point, pain point solution proof point?

Mihika Kapoor (00:11:58):
Because at the end of the day, simply describing a product idea in words is not as compelling as seeing a testimonial from a user on top of a prototype or a mock, and really feeling the pain points.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):
Is there an example that we could talk about? I know you can't talk about the product you're working on yet, but from the past of a vision that you crafted maybe to share what the vision was or how you came to that to make this even more real?

Mihika Kapoor (00:12:24):
So, before I was working on the new product, I was working on the FigJam team, and I was an early member of the FigJam team. And whiteboarding was something that really took off during the pandemic because it was the first time that people were not together in office, couldn't jam together, couldn't just throw up a whiteboard behind them physically. And so, there was kind of this question of, okay, how do you combat these disparate teammates and pull them together into a common space? And I think that when we think about FigJam and what success might look like for FigJam, a part of it that I was really invested in was the meetings experience. And specifically, what the world would look like if we were successful at bringing people together into a common space?

Mihika Kapoor (00:13:23):
And one of the early insights was, okay, what is the most common meeting that takes place in a FigJam file? It's a brainstorm, right? It's like you have a bunch of people, you've coming together and they're dropping a bunch of stickies and stuff like that. And so, you have this proof point of an activity that works really well inside of a FigJam file. But then, at the same time, something that's really interesting about FigJam, people often ask, "Oh, you guys are Figma. How do you guys use Figma as a company?" And it's kind of interesting because I feel like we use Figma the way that everyone uses Figma, but we use FigJam on steroids. Every single activity in this company is done in FigJam. Our product reviews are in there, our Gantt charts are in there, our bug bashes are in there. Every single thing is in FigJam.

Mihika Kapoor (00:14:10):
And there was this gap between the way that we were using FigJam as a company and the way that the rest of the world was using it, but brainstorms were working. And so, you kind of think, "Okay, what's unique about a brainstorm?" And you talk to your users and you're like, "Why does a brainstorm make so much more sense in a FigJam file than anything else?" And what it comes down to is brainstorms are this incredibly democratizing process. It's this process where ideas can come from anywhere, where it's not the loudest or the most important person in the room who's doing the talking, but it's everyone altogether. And you're able to elicit reactions from people who are more quiet in a meeting or people who may prefer to ideate on their own before coming out to everyone and things like that.

Mihika Kapoor (00:14:53):
And so, we started with the seed of brainstorms being this highly democratic process. And what you see is that in most other scenarios, meetings are very one way. You have one person talking, and everyone else reacting. This is true of a team kickoff. This is true of an all-hands. This is true of basically every sort of scenario. And so, what we fundamentally started marching towards was how can we create this world where the generative nature of a brainstorm is basically the norm in other kinds of meetings. Where a team kickoff is not just a PM and a designer handing mocks to an engineer, but it's everyone leaving stickies and everyone commenting at the same time, or everyone leaving...

Mihika Kapoor (00:15:44):
We have this ritual called Kudos Boards inside of FigJam, where everyone will shower each other with love and just kind call out their teammates for what they've done over the last week or so. And so how can we ensure that those kind of rituals are in our templates and that we're teaching people how to take any meeting and make it more democratic? And then, you anchor on this vision around, okay, what does a more democratic workplace look like and how can we get people to anchor around that and how can we get people to get into the flow? So, then we started launching features like music, like voting, that really help you get into flow when you're in that pile together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:22):
That is such a cool example. I'm trying to be this archeologist studying what you're describing and breaking it apart. So, what I'm hearing essentially is there's this insight that you find of, "Oh, here's a way we should think about the way future of work. It should be more democratic," building on this idea of brainstorming, which is one of the most inspiring ways of working where it's not just someone sitting in a silo. And then, you take that and create kind of a, "Here's what the world could look like if we could make everything this feel this way, very democratic." And then there's this pitch that you eventually make of, "Here's the product." And you talked about how the way you pitch it is, "Here's a pain, here's a solution, and here's a proof point of that solution," could be a testimonial or some data, I imagine.

Mihika Kapoor (00:17:06):
Definitely. I think that when you're actually presenting a vision, one of the most important things is that there is a single artifact that the team is creating together. So, I think a common occurrence is to have the research readout, followed by the design crit, followed by the product review. And that's fine, that works in a lot of instances, but then you have every team member thinking that their own deliverable is what they need to pour all their energy into. And what you actually want is for everyone to feel incredible ownership and incredible passion about this combined deliverable, so that it's a unified team who believes a singular set of insights.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:52):
So, what's an example of that? Is it like a deck in Figma?

Mihika Kapoor (00:17:54):
Yeah, exactly. So, we often make our decks in Figma, and I think that we lean heavily into designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light. So, I think that's something that's really unique about Figma is normally you will talk about the market space or the opportunity of the sizing, and then decide to invest. Versus Figma is very much a see to believe and see to feel that emotional pull towards this is something worth investing in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:25):
Got it. So, that's what I was trying to get to is how do you actually deliver a vision? So, a lot of people, " Here, I need to create a vision. I'm going to write out a paragraph or a memo describing it." You can create mock-ups. The way you're describing it, essentially, is make it as real as possible, not just mocks, but actual prototypes potentially. Many people don't have design skills or designers on their team or engineering skills to build a prototype. Is there anything you can share for how to do this where you don't have those skills?

Mihika Kapoor (00:18:54):
Yeah. Well, the good thing is that with AI, it's getting way easier. So-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
True.

Mihika Kapoor (00:19:00):
A couple of weeks ago, Cognition launched, which for those who don't know, is a startup that made this AI agent called Devin, which can code anything for you, supposedly. It definitely took Twitter by storm and got me super stoked. And so, I think something that's interesting about the current AI revolution is that it's very much lowering the floor to starting out and to building something. And so, recently, I was doing a chat with David Huang from Replit, and he's the head of marketing and design at Replit. And he was basically talking about how if Replit does their job right, you start seeing it as your technical co-founder. And I think, conversely at Figma we kind of think about if we're doing our job, maybe in the future people will think about Figma as their designer co-founder, where you can go in and use it to start bringing things into existence.

Mihika Kapoor (00:20:03):
So, I think one is, yeah, I do think that we're just trending in a direction, and this was not true a year ago, where the floor to building something is just so much lower. So, that's one piece. I think the second piece is just go around and ask people. And so, for example, for the project that I'm currently working on, I used a hackathon to pitch it. And basically, I built conviction in the idea many months before the hackathon, and I was verbally pitching it. And it was kind of like, "Oh yeah, maybe at some point in the future we would make an investment like this."

Mihika Kapoor (00:20:43):
But what actually ended up happening was we have this concept called Maker Week, which is our internal hackathon, where the entire company goes on pause for a week. And I think that most people think that, "Oh, hackathons are only a time for engineers to build." And I think that that's one of the biggest mistakes ever. I think that anyone can have an idea and can... Literally, what I did was walk around the New York office asking every single person, "Will you work on this thing with me?" And eventually, someone says yes, and then you can use that to build momentum, grow the team, and build something great. But I think that never letting your own skills stop you from going out there making a pitch and then turning that into reality is really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:27):
I love both of these points and pieces of advice. I feel like I always say that if a PM has a designer partner that can just help them with a deck or help them with ideas, that you're such a superpower, everything just looks so much more interesting when you have a designer helping you craft your idea. And the way you describe it is pretty simple. Just go ask people for help because you're probably going to find someone that's going to help you out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):
You mentioned conviction, so that's a great segue to else where I wanted to go next. So, I asked Yuhki, chief product officer at Figma, about your strengths. And he told me that you get extremely strong conviction extremely quickly. He said that this strong conviction allows you to navigate the messy journey from zero to one and rally your team in a really powerful way. He actually wanted me to ask you this very question, how do you get to this strong conviction? And how much of it is to true deep conviction, versus there's an inkling of instinct that this is going to work and then you profit on the sense of conviction to get people rallying behind you and to kind of take this leap of faith?

Mihika Kapoor (00:22:31):
I think that one of the most important things for a PM to create for their team is momentum. You have to constantly be creating forward progress, probably towards that vision that we were just talking about. But I'm a huge proponent of Jeff Bezos's one-way doors, two-way doors framework. And I think that especially in a software company, most things are two-way doors. You can come back. And so, it's so important to have an opinion and use that opinion to anchor people around and have people react to. So, I used to work at Meta before I worked at Figma, and Meta basically distilled the product role into two core capabilities. One was product sense and one was execution. And when you think about product sense, it's like, okay, what is product sense? It's like a really abstract term. And at the end of the day, I think product sense is just having good intuition.

Mihika Kapoor (00:23:34):
And so, there's this question about, okay, how do you build up intuition? And I think that it's just by having this insatiable curiosity and talking to users at every chance you get. So, I would go to dinners and grill the people around me on how they use Figma and how they use FigJam. And I think when you have a conversation with someone, it's so much more powerful in terms of getting those anecdotes to stick in your head. And what actually happens is once you start having enough conversations, let's say you start with conversations ABC, then you progress to conversations DEF, over time you build this almost repository or library of conversations that you can draw from as you're making product decisions. And so, I think that that's a really powerful thing to lean into as you're thinking about, "Okay, which path do we go down?"

Mihika Kapoor (00:24:23):
Now, there's the question of in the absence of any external signal, what can you do? And I think that a very common thing, especially for PMs who are younger in their career, is to think that your opinion isn't right or might not be reflective of what the user thinks. So, you think, "Okay, I believe this," and at the end of the day, everyone has an opinion, right? So, "I think this, but what do I know compared to these people who've been in my company for 10 years?" Or, "What do I know compared to my users who are using the product?" And so, then I think what might happen in those instances is you kind of start from nothing, you start from zero and you're like, "Okay, I'm going to build up from zero and gather all of these insights to get to a good place."

Mihika Kapoor (00:25:11):
And I think my take is that putting out an idea, even if it's totally wrong, is a much better catalyst for getting to a good solution because people are much more likely to react to an idea than to nothing. So, if it's the right idea, then they'll be like, "Oh my God, yes, let's totally do that." And if it's wrong, then it's like, okay, then they will take you in a different direction and you end up with something that's probably much more opinionated than if you hadn't put anything out there. And so, it was funny, one piece of advice that I got from Yuhki when I was working on my vision sprint was like, "Okay, when you go into research, you want to go in with something that's at least an A- idea, or you think is at least an A- idea. Because if you talk to users and you learn something about it, that's awesome. Get to an A+. If not, at least you're not at a B." And so, I think that having-

Mihika Kapoor (00:26:03):
If not, at least you're not at a B. And so I think that having that early conviction, being willing to communicate it, being willing to get feedback from other folks in your team, have them react to it, then get users to react to it, is so important, but then also something that's equally important when you have "high conviction", quote, unquote, is to be willing to kill your darlings if you hear something that tells you otherwise. You need to be so sort of strong opinions weekly held. And if you get external signal that's telling you something different, you should be ready to pivot and have that agility to do so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:37):
There's a lot of PMs that kind of worry about having too strong of an opinion and being like, "Here's what we're doing," because then there's this like, "Oh, okay, they just want us to do the thing they want us to do, and we don't have a voice. We don't have a chance to influence." It seems like you find a really magical balance of strong opinion of like, "Here's what we should be doing," but people still love working with you and don't feel like... I haven't heard like, "Oh, she just tells us what to bill." What advice do you have there of just finding that balance and making it clear? It's just my idea. We can change it.

Mihika Kapoor (00:27:07):
I would say that speaking about weaknesses, having such strong conviction absolutely has downsides. In particular, it's possible that it doesn't have the desired effect. So for example, my designer who I work with, his name is Kean, he's so talented. We work like this. Literally for most of last year, we had an hour long one- on-one every single day and still that wasn't enough-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
Everyday?

Mihika Kapoor (00:27:32):
... meeting time. Yes. We basically work together like this, but he also told me that when I joined the company, he was like, "Who is this girl and why does she have so many opinions?" And so I think that something that I have learned to do over time, and I think that's something that's a good sort of thing to lean into if you are a PM who has strong opinions, is to be very direct about how much you care about your opinions. So now, I'll do this thing where I'll be like, "Oh, I think we should do this, but I feel like medium confidence on it." So if you feel stronger like, "I defer to you," and always being very, very, very explicit about like, "I feel really strongly about this," or, "This is my hypothesis," or, "I do not have an opinion here. I defer to you."

Mihika Kapoor (00:28:21):
I think the second thing that I would mention that is really important in order to do this correctly is... So I have a very direct communication style. I will never sugarcoat anything. I'll never say I like something if I don't like something. If I'm in a meeting and someone tells me they don't agree with me, I will tell them I don't agree with them back. In return, I really like it when people are very direct with me. And so I think that whenever I join a team or whenever I start working with a new person, I always let them know. I'm always like, :I am very direct and if you disagree with me, I want to know that."

Mihika Kapoor (00:28:55):
Because I think sometimes what can happen is really strongly minded PMs can go into a conversation and can be like, "Oh, I think we should do X," even though they actually feel medium confidence about X. And then the rest of the room is like, "Oh, my God. That PM feels so strongly about doing X that I'm not going to say anything because they clearly have so much conviction in X." And what you actually want is for everyone to feel comfortable speaking up. And so creating that culture where everyone feels comfortable giving their opinion and communicating their level of confidence is really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
So this direct communication point you made, somebody shared this quote, Alice Ching, who I think your EM said this about you that she's in awe of how direct you are, especially how you can make it not personal and help people focus on the matter at hand. Any other advice you have there for people to, one, either be more direct and successful in that being directness? Or is there an example you can share where, because I think people hear this, they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to be direct. I'm going to be so direct, it's going to be great," and then it's so hard to actually do, so is there maybe an example that comes to mind of here's something you did recently of like, "Oh, wow. Okay, I see what she's talking about"?

Mihika Kapoor (00:30:07):
So I think that directness only works if it's two-way. If it is one person being really direct with another person and then the other person being afraid to talk, you will end up in probably a not great relationship where communication is only going one way and both people will be in their own head. The person being direct will be like, "Why is the other person not responding to my feedback?" And then the other person will be like, "Why am I the only one getting so much feedback?" Meta, where I used to work, had this phrase, "Feedback as a gift," and I so deeply believe in this. And in order to really lean into that phrase and really embody it, I think it's really important that feedback is this constantly flowing thing, not something that happens once or twice a year when you have an official feedback cycle.

Mihika Kapoor (00:30:57):
And the way that I try and create this culture of constant direct communication, constant feedback is if you have feedback to give someone else, I think you can start by asking, "Hey, do you have feedback from me?" And kind of taking the feedback first so then that person feels like, "Okay, maybe I have my way of seeing this situation. Let me communicate that and get off my chest." And then when you give your feedback, it's sort of even. And then feedback in my opinion is something that you should always act on. So then to the extent that you can as soon as possible put that into effect and be like, "Okay, I'm hearing this. I'm going to do XYZ in order to combat that." I think then that incentivizes the other person to do the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):
Okay, let me quickly summarize what we've gone through so far in our archaeological study, and then I'm going to drill into a specific trait. So one is just having a really powerful vision that people get really excited about. And the way you described it is kind of find an insight about how you think people could be, in this example, how people could be working maybe through this brainstorm approach and then kind of expanding that into something where this is what would happen if we achieve this in the future, and this is what the world could look like, and that's something people get really excited about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):
So kind of creating compelling vision, being able to communicate it with, and in your experience, communicating with prototypes and mocks is the way that you find it to be most effective. Also, just getting to strong conviction, whether it's real or not, but it sounds like it's actually very genuine about an idea and making it clear. You're very excited about this and here's how it's going to be amazing for the business and the company, and here's why you should be excited about it. Also, you talked about being very direct and being very honest and basically radical candor as some people describe it. First of all, is there anything else I missed specifically before I drill into one of these?

Mihika Kapoor (00:32:47):
That sounds right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
Okay, cool. So kind of along these lines, something else that came up a bunch of in my emails with folks that you work with is how you build hype really effectively, and you talked about this a bit of just creating momentum about an idea. So you got this idea, get everyone pitch it, get everyone excited, and then it just continues to build hype and momentum. So a quote from Karl Jiang, who is on your team maybe, he said, "I feel no PM has ever got me so hyped about a feature." And Yuhki said that you overcome people's doubts by building hype and hacking hype is the way described it. Talk about this and why do you think it's important and how you actually go about doing this.

Mihika Kapoor (00:33:31):
When you are spearheading an idea or a product, it's really on you to have a pulse on how everyone else is feeling about that product. And different products need different levels of excitement to make it out the door. If there is something that leadership has really strong conviction in, it's important for leadership to amp the whole company up behind that vision. On the flip side, if you yourself are pushing a zero to one idea from the bottoms up, the onus is even more on you to make sure that that project and that product is constantly propped up and that people are excited about it to make it out the door. And so one example is we've been talking about this product that I'm working on. And coming out of winter break this year, there's this sense, or at least I always suspect, that there's this sense of over winter break, everyone forgets what happened last year. It goes at the door because you were hopefully doing something that took your mind off work.

Mihika Kapoor (00:34:43):
And so at the same time, there's this sense of how do you create forward momentum inside of a company in January when people are slowly coming back into office, everyone's trickling back in at different dates because everyone to click slightly different PTO, how do you rally people in a certain direction? And so we have this thing at Figma called SKO or Sales Kickoff, which is every year the sales team comes together, and we have a keynote and a set of fireside chats and stuff like that, and we talk about what's coming for the year. And at this point, our product, it existed, but it was absolutely barely built. It was rough around the edges. It had bugs every day. Maybe 10 people in the company were using it and something like that outside of the team.

Mihika Kapoor (00:35:37):
Yeah, it was so important to me that this product got visibility in this forum because this was the first company-wide forum of the year where we were declaring priorities for the year. And so it was so important to me that this product had some sort of a moment, or speaking of show, don't tell, a demo in the context of this keynote. And so Kris, our CTO and Yuhki, our CPO, were giving this keynote on what does our year look like? And I really, really deeply insisted that we should include a demo. And I think what ended up happening is something like that, a demo that wasn't meant to be a demo or that people weren't expecting does so much in terms of driving that sense of hype and helping people see what you yourself see in the future. And what's really interesting is I think that hype is something that... You can't really create hype for something you don't believe in my opinion. The only way to create hype is to get people to see what you see.

Mihika Kapoor (00:36:50):
And so I think that it's incredibly important to leverage very large forums like that Maker Week, like Sales Kickoff. We have CONFIG, which is our annual showcase to the world of what we're working on in order to get everyone to see what you're seeing and to be really scrappy about it and to really be the person who's pushing your product to its limits in the right moments. And I think what you find is that if you push your product to get visibility, maybe even beyond what the current stage of product development merits is that you have really incredible learnings because the more that you can put your product in front of people and get them to use it, the more signal you get on how it's trending. And so what ended up happening was something that could have originally been perceived as a distraction to the team actually ended up being something that added so much fuel to the fire in terms of, one, giving us product insights to inform our next steps. And two, getting the entire company to feel truly, deeply feel excited about getting this thing out the door.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:58):
And this pitch and product you're describing is the one that's going to be launching this mysterious new product, right?

Mihika Kapoor (00:38:03):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):
I feel like we're going to build so much hype for this thing when it ever comes out. I'm so excited to learn what it is. Coming back to the point, so what I'm hearing essentially is you find it's important to take responsibility for this thing to become a thing at a company. A lot of people have an idea, they build a prototype, they build a hackathon project, and then they're like, "God, no one's ever doing anything with it. It's not going anywhere. Nothing ever happens." What I'm hearing is it's on you to get people excited about it and find these opportunities to get people excited about it. And there's also this, what I'm feeling is the feels is really important. It's like you have all the data probably. There's probably a logical case for this that you've made across the company, but what you're describing here is you need to get people hyped about it in a emotional, visceral way and basically find opportunities to do that is kind of a lesson here.

Mihika Kapoor (00:38:52):
In my mind, there is internal hype, which is how do you get buy-in and everyone inside of the company to be fanging their fist on the table for a product to get built, but there's also external hype, which is like how do you get your users hyped about your product? How do you get them to really be so stoked when there are milestone occasions for your product or milestone launches and for them to be celebrating with you? And one of the things that I loved the most when I joined the company was Figma and design Twitter have had this very symbiotic relationship where each has grown with the other over time. And what really happens is anytime we launch something, you have all of design Twitter celebrating with us.

Mihika Kapoor (00:39:38):
And one other moment when I thought it was very fun to drive hype was when I worked on FigJam in 2022. It was the one year FigJam anniversary in April, and project anniversaries or product anniversaries are quite an exciting milestone within the company. You bring everyone together, maybe you pop a bottle of champagne, you kind of celebrate how far you've come and what all you've learned since the launch. But we were really thinking like, "Okay, FigJam is awesome, but FigJam isn't just any product. Figjam has a personality. FigJam is cheeky. FigJam is fun. FigJam has this cute skeuomorphism going on where you feel like it's your friend. And so okay, how would you celebrate that moment for a friend?" You wouldn't really have an anniversary party. You would throw it a full on birthday party.

Mihika Kapoor (00:40:34):
And so what we basically did was at the one year anniversary of FigJam, I worked with the marketing team and our engineering team in order to basically kick off a mini launch inside of the product of a bunch of new features. And what we did was we Easter egged them through the product and each sort of product that we were releasing inside of FigJam was hidden under this little birthday present. And throughout the day, we sent all of our users on an Easter egg hunt of presents inside of FigJam. And so not only was a FigJam getting the presents, but it was our users getting the presents. I think that hype as well is really tied to emotion. So to the extent that a person using a product can feel like, "Oh, this thing that is built in the product was built for me not to advance the company's goals or anything like that, but to make me feel special, to make me feel happy."

Mihika Kapoor (00:41:34):
I think that's a really key instrument in driving hype as well. And I think that something that's quite interesting about hype and getting your users to feel strongly about your product is that every product has their own brand of delight or excitement or energy. So hype for FigJam is incredibly different than hype from Figma, where hype for Figma might be this really, really niche design capability that unlocks this pain point that designers have been having for years and years. And then hype for Apple might be like the world's best unboxing experience or something like that. And so leaning into a product's brand in order to figure out what is the optimal way to generate hype with your audience and form that connection is something that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:19):
I love that example. Something else I'm finding as a thread throughout all of the lessons and stories he shares is just an immersion in your user base and truly knowing what they're excited about, what problems they have, and you talk about having strong conviction and painting a grand vision. It's one thing if someone that doesn't do that does that, it's just like, why would I believe them? Versus someone that like you, where you're just constantly talking to users and actually understand what they need. So I guess the question here is just what advice would you share with folks to build that, to be immersed with users? What do you actually do? How do you actually do that? Are you just organizing meetings, events? Are you scheduling chats? How do you do this?

Mihika Kapoor (00:43:03):
Yeah, so I think it honestly depends on the product. So when I worked at Meta, it was so easy. Everyone and their mom had opinion about the product, which was really great because it meant that anyone you met, you could kind of ask them what they liked, what they didn't like. You can relay that through the company, et cetera. Now at Figma, we have a slightly more niche audience. I think that hopefully, ultimately we get to everyone. We started with design teams, now we're thinking about the entire product development cycle and how we can build for that, and then who knows, beyond that could be anything. But I think that constantly immersing yourself in those circles where your users are is really important. So for me, it's like anytime that I'm catching up with a friend, who mildly works in tech or a tech adjacent field, I will generally be asking them about Figma. And I think what's really great is that as a company scales over time, their user base gets broader and broader. And so when we grew from a single product company with Figma into now a multi product company with FigJam, dev mode, etc, our audience exploded. And we already saw latent behavior inside of Figma, but now it's even more clear how wide reaching the product is. And so something that I find incredibly useful is to not just ask users of your product what they think about your product, but to ask non-users about your product, why they're not using your product. And actually I think that those are the most insightful conversations because I think that having a product shine and having a product do well and have great adoption isn't just about the product being great. It's also about the marketing and the perceptions that surround the product and potentially the hype that surrounds that, right?

Mihika Kapoor (00:45:01):
And so having those conversations about... I remember having an early conversation with folks from my previous team about, "Hey, are you guys using FigJam?" And they would be like, "Maybe sometimes." And I'd be like, "Well, why aren't you using FigJam? It's literally built for you." And then that led to a series of product insights that led us to invest in a set of features that would make it much easier for a non-designer to get started out on the canvas. So we launched this kind of placeholder experience that rather than traditional templates, really let people see the various use cases and preview the various use cases on the canvas. And so that was incredibly important. And then Figma, of course, is kind of like it's in this pro-sumer space where it's like you talk to anyone in tech and maybe they're your top total addressable market.

Mihika Kapoor (00:45:48):
But then there are some products I know that people work on which are very removed from the average person, you have infra products, security products and things like that, where you can't just walk up to someone and have a conversation with them about why aren't they using your product because that conversation might not make any sense. And so in those instances, I think that what's really important is it depends on the stage of company that you're at. If you're at an early stage company, you need to be the one going out there and having conversations with your users and just literally looking up your users through whatever channels necessary and figuring out how you can connect with them. I think this is also why founder market fit at startups is so important is because to the extent that you can use yourself as a limits test for what user needs there are, that helps you move really fast in the product development cycle.

Mihika Kapoor (00:46:40):
And then if you're on the larger side, I think that having a really tight relationship with your sales team is really important. And basically, just being on sales calls because you want to be in a situation where the customer pain points on sales calls are cross pollinating into the product roadmap, and you also want to ensure that your sales team has visibility into what might be coming and are constantly informing that. And so I think really leaning into that, building that relationship between these traditionally more siloed orgs and hopping on those calls is something that I'd really recommend.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):
Awesome. Let's go actually one layer deeper here. So you're talking to people all the time about FigJam, "Aren't you using FigJam? What do you think of Figma? What do think of this?" You're hopping on sales calls. What do you do with what you hear? Is there kind of an operational approach where you... Do you just put in your head and sticks in your head and rolls around and comes up, things emerge? Do you have a place you put these insights, you're learning? Are you putting post-its in FigJam, for example. And then on the sales side, do you have a cadence where I'm going to join a sales call once a week, here's a person I love in sales, I'm going to try to join all the calls. How do you actually operationalize these things?

Mihika Kapoor (00:47:50):
The insights get operationalized in a number of ways. So first is... So yeah, let's continue using FigJam as an example. I think, like I mentioned, Figma as a company uses FigJam for everything. Multiple FigJam files are made per day, per meeting, et cetera. We had this initial situation where people outside of the company were mostly using FigJam for brainstorms. And so as we were scaling our FigJam sales team, I sort of set up a recurring cadence with the folks in our sales team in order to understand like, "Okay, what are you guys hearing?" And then I would share what was coming, and then I would use their input as signal as to what should be prioritized or deprioritized on the roadmap. And they would use my signal to understand what were the various use cases that they could be pushing with the customers.

Mihika Kapoor (00:48:45):
And one thing that happened during one of the meetings was I literally walked them through, this meeting, this is how I use FigJam. In this meeting, this is how I use FigJam. In this meeting, this is how I use FigJam, blah, blah, blah. And what that resulted in was I actually made a Loom video walking through my weekend FigJam, that our sales team later distributed to a bunch of companies to inspire them as to like, "Hey, not only can you use FigJam for this, you can use Fig Jam for X, Y, Z. You can use it for your team pickups. You can use it for your retros. You can use it for planning your mom's birthday party. You can use it for planning your all hands. You can use it for sketching out the contents of what's going to go into your next deck," so on and so forth. And so it basically manifests in two way, the first is having it inform the prioritization of your product roadmap.

Mihika Kapoor (00:49:35):
And then the second is what ideally creating artifacts that the sales team can use to evangelize the things that you are seeing and the stepping stones to that vision that you creating. And then the last thing is that sometimes the conversations aren't immediately actionable, right? Sometimes the sales team has an insight or has a request that is just objectively not feasible because the team has too much on its plate. Conversely, sometimes the team might have a suggestion for something that might be pitched to sales folks that's too early given the stage of the conversation. And for that, we basically have... We store it in Asana basically. We have this integration, which many companies might have, which is like Slack integration, where you can react with an Asana emoji, and then any piece of feedback that comes in from sales or from the rest of the company gets turned into a task in your backlog, and then you do a weekly grooming of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:33):
Amazing. Cool. Very tactical and useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:28):
Another thread that I've noticed, and I wasn't planning to go in this direction, but you just care so deeply about the things you work on. You actually really, really love it and want it to be incredibly successful and feels like you're just always thinking about it. Reminding me of this quote from your colleague Karl, they shared that, "It feels like you care deeply, which makes me care deeply. Who wants to be led by someone who doesn't care about what they're building?" It feels like that's an important part of the way you work and think. Is there anything you want to say about that?

Mihika Kapoor (00:52:01):
When I started out my product career, I actually-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):
... About that.

Mihika Kapoor (00:52:03):
When I started out my product career, I actually joined as a RPM, or rotational product manager, at Meta, which was effectively a program that brought together new grad PMs, so people who had zero PM experience and taught them how to be PMs. And, in the beginning of this program, we had a series of conversations with leaders across the company. And, one particularly notable conversation was with Julie Zhu, who was the first ever intern at Meta and the VP of design. And, she was giving us feedback and advice about how to draft compelling product strategy, etc. And, something she said that has stuck with me throughout my entire product career is that when two people disagree about product strategy, it is because they have different assumptions. Because, if you have the same assumptions, there is no reason why a person should think, "We should do X versus we should do Y." And so, it's like, "Okay, how does this relate to what you were just asking about feeling deeply and caring about what you're building?"

Mihika Kapoor (00:53:11):
I think that it's really important to not just build a roadmap because it's handed to you, or not just build an idea because it's handed to you. I think that you need to understand in the event that it's a top-down strategy, what are the assumptions that led to folks believing that that is the right idea? And then, if it is you pushing something bottoms up, you need to be able to ensure that everyone else has the same assumptions that you have in your head that leads them to believe deeply or not believe deeply. And I think what's really important is that people can, to Carl's point, gauge someone is about a project. And, my take is that, the more you believe in an idea, the more natural it is to be passionate about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:02):
I imagine people listening to this will feel like, "Oh shit, I don't really love what I'm working on. I don't work at Figma. I don't have the best of most amazing products." Maybe it's hard to get excited about stuff. Is there anything you could share there? Just say you're working on something that you're not so passionate about, is it a fine thing, keep searching, or is it just figure out something you're excited about? Any advice there for someone in that boat?

Mihika Kapoor (00:54:25):
My first piece of advice would be to not just think about the scope of what you are working on as the thing that happens to be in flight at any given moment. But, if you're working in a company, take a step back, understand the vision of that company, and understand your users, and understand if there's anything in that space that you are passionate about. I think it's quite easy to believe that the project that you're working on is your scope. My take is that your scope is the world, and to the extent that you can figure out does the idea that you're passionate about fall within your company, versus fall outside of your company, that should guide the next steps in your career. And so, I think that potentially common misconception is that founding something is just for capital F founders, but I think that anyone can found something. You can found something inside of an existing company, you can found something from scratch. And, there are different reasons why you would do each, right?

Mihika Kapoor (00:55:43):
The reasons why you would found inside of an existing company is if you think that there is a distribution advantage that you want to take advantage of, if there is a technical or platform advantage that you want to take advantage of. Or, there's also a reality which is it's slightly less risk. So, depending on what your risk tolerance is, you can figure out what makes sense. There are things that are harder inside of an existing company, right? It's harder to take an executive decision. You actually cannot take an executive decision. You need to receive buy-in on every single decision that you make. Sometimes it's harder to move faster. And then sometimes, there are things that are just different when you're starting inside of an existing company, versus starting something outright.

Mihika Kapoor (00:56:27):
So the things that are different is building a team is quite different. The way that you recruit and the set of folks that you can recruit from, that composition is quite different. And then, the way that you pitch and who you are pitching to is quite different. And so, I think that sometimes, yeah, it makes sense to found inside of a company and to use that to make your flame burn, right? Sometimes it makes sense to found outright. But I think that the first key to being passionate about what you're working on is to find an idea that you're passionate about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:01):
I love this as a metaphor of the flame where it applies both to you as a person at a company and keeping that flame going and building it. And then also the idea and a project that accompanies little flame that you're growing over time, building momentum around. So you've hinted at this whole idea of starting zero to one and building new products within larger companies, which I want to get to. We've gone really deep on a bunch of awesome stuff and I'm really happy we did. There's four more skills of things you're amazing at. So here's an idea, let me share the four. How about you pick two that you're most passionate about that you think you have the most advice to share, and then we'll just do those, and then we'll go to what you've learned about building something completely new at a larger company? How does that sound?

Mihika Kapoor (00:57:40):
Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:42):
Okay. So, from folks that you work with, the four other skills, things you're amazing at, and I still want to hear the things you think you're not amazing at. One is creativity, that you have really creative solutions to problems. Two is empathy. You're really strong at empathizing with users and using that to build amazing products. Three is culture. Sho tells me you're the culture carrier at Figma, which is amazing, because the culture there from what I hear is amazing. And then, four is dealing with change. You're amazing at just like, "Okay, cool. Priorities are changing. Great, let's go. Here we go." Which of those two feel most interesting to you?

Mihika Kapoor (00:58:21):
Maybe we can do the latter two, because they're a little bit different than the other things we've been discussing. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:27):
Sounds great. So, I guess culture. Let me start there. Okay, so yeah, Sho called you the culture carrier Figma. I hear there's some fun things you all do there. There's something called the hot seat, there's something called the Figgies. First of all, can you maybe explain these two things? And then just broadly, what you find is important about focusing on culture as a PM?

Mihika Kapoor (00:58:49):
Yeah, I can definitely talk about those two things. So, hot seat is actually a tradition I started at our first PM offsite post-pandemic. So this was March of 2022. The PM team was sub-15 people at that point, and we all fit around a dinner table, which is no longer true today. And, it was really important to me that we all got to know each other in a context that was outside of work. I think that PMing is a highly collaborative function. And, to the extent that you have great relationships with all the teams that you're interfacing with, one is it goes a long way in terms of the product, but two, speaking about passion, it makes your day-to-day so much more fun if you feel like you're working with your friends, and if you are working with your friends.

Mihika Kapoor (00:59:39):
And so, we were coming out of a long intense day session, and I was thinking about, "Okay, how do we break the ice?" And, hot seat is this game where you go around the table and each person gets two minutes on the clock and everyone else at the table can ask them anything. And if they want to, they can decline to answer. But we try and keep it, generally speaking, quite friendly and comfortable for folks. And so, we kicked off this game. And, what was really interesting was earlier that day we had done a personality test, as a side note, our PM team is obsessed with personality tests.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):
Which personality test, by the way?

Mihika Kapoor (01:00:19):
We to this day say the best one was the one that we did at this offsite, which is the Strengths Finder test. And, what had basically happened was over the course of that morning, we had all dug into... We were saying, "What are our strengths? What are our weaknesses?" Etc. And we had this really fun foundation to build on during the game of hot seat, where it was like, we were digging into like, "What about people's backgrounds made them think the way that they do today? And, what random anecdote at age seven of playing catch with their dad in the field led to how they thought about auto layout? Blah, blah, blah, blah." And, I think that being able to understand what motivates a person is so important when you're working with them, and also just in building a connection with them. And so, that was this moment that really brought the whole team together.

Mihika Kapoor (01:01:09):
Something that I was really gratified to hear after is that, since then, hot seat has become a tradition within the company. And so, all the PMs went on to play it with their own teams. Yuki and Sho went on to play it with the exec team, so on and so forth. And so, it's become this thing that now anytime that someone joins the team, okay, you put them in the hot seat. And then, if you're meeting someone's significant other, you put them in the hot seat. And it's this thing that is just totally spread, but it's a really fun way to just get to know folks and what drives them. So, that's one of my favorites. I highly recommend.

Mihika Kapoor (01:01:42):
The second thing that you asked about, which was the Figgies. And, this is basically an Oscar style awards ceremony that was hacked together. And so, where the Figgies was inspired from was actually every year we have... I was mentioning like SKO, our sales kickoff. And, on the last night of SKO, there's this award ceremony, where they appreciate all of the incredible work that has taken place in the sales and marketing org. And I saw this and I was like, "This is incredible. We should absolutely be celebrating the product team as well when we're together." And so, what I did was I basically took our Figma boardroom, which is called Bigma, and worked with another PM Elan to deck it out, and a red carpet, gold curtains, etc. And we bought little Oscar trophies for everyone, and got their names written on it, and voted people in for all of these absurd categories, like most likely to name their child Figma, most likely to go their career without writing a PRD. Blah, blah, blah.

Mihika Kapoor (01:02:55):
And, of course, forced everyone to give some acceptance speech. But, I think that making people feel appreciated for even just the quirks and the energy that they bring to the team is something that's incredibly important. And celebrating that diversity together is something that I think goes a long way in terms of making people feel close, and also making people understand maybe someone who they don't know that well on the PM team, because then you learn, "Okay, beyond them having this Zoom background, this is what's cheeky about them. Or this is what's interesting or unique about them." And so, I think that culture is so important. Figma has this core value called play, which I love, which really emphasizes just that everyone should be having fun at all times, and work should be fun, and gathering should be fun. And I think that I personally am a huge believer in this remote first role that we live in, you also want to take advantage of those times when you're able to get together and do things that make the team feel geographically close, even when they're geographically spread out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh man, it's so fun. And I love that it's just like, you did this, right? It's not like Dylan is adding all these rituals to the team. It's very bottom up. And, in theory, any PM on the team could have done this.

Mihika Kapoor (01:04:21):
It's interesting, something that I had heard, Vishal Shah, who was the former head of product at Instagram say, is that, often in companies culture is set top down, and then the innovation that comes out of that is bottoms up. And so, I think in the first place, having a value like play does a lot in order to make folks feel like these things are celebrated and time should be carved out for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
To come back to your original point of just culture is everything, a lot of PMs are like, "I have so much work to do. I have so many things to do. I'm just working all day every day." What can you tell them about why this is so important and worth putting some time into? And should everybody? Or is it just like, "If you're excited about this, do it. If not, don't worry"?

Mihika Kapoor (01:05:06):
I think culture is important in that it establishes trust between groups of people. And so, I think that actually earlier you were asking about passion and what makes someone feel passionate about work. And I think realistically, that passion breaks down into two things. One is, are you passionate about the vision that you're building towards? Which we spoke about. But the second thing is, are you passionate about the people who you work with?

Mihika Kapoor (01:05:35):
And, I think that roadmaps change, products change, but feeling a connection to the folks that you're working with make you much more durable as a team. It means that when times get tough, which they will, your gut instinct is to rally together and collaborate together to find a solution, rather than to jump ship or something. I think personally, I'm in love with my team. They give me so much joy and happiness on a daily basis. I was telling them the other day that when they post prototypes in our Slack channel, sometimes I get little flutters in my chest like when you have a crush on someone. And, I think that having that emotional connection to your team is fun. And I think that emotional connection comes from investing in culture.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:26):
And again, it's like, you did it. You made it happen, right? It's not like, "Oh, this sucks. My team's no fun." It's like, you can make it more fun. And I think the two examples you shared are awesome, because one is a high-end version where there's a lot of work. And the hot seat, it's just a quick idea that takes no work, just an idea, and then you just ask to do it, and it's there.

Mihika Kapoor (01:06:44):
Okay, so actually, I want to combat the perception that the Figgy's was a high production, high cost thing. It was very low cost. I ordered everything on Amazon and assembled it in an hour. And so, there are ways to be scrappy in making things come together. And so, I would say, don't be intimidated by any idea of being too large to take on. Just go for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:08):
That's an awesome correction. Okay, final trait you're great at. Somebody shared that you pivot with grace and enthusiasm when things change and priorities change, projects are killed, projects are spun up. There's something that a lot of people at companies just get so sad about, "Oh my God, things keep changing. My project's killed. Oh, this priority changed." It feels like you've learned to make that a superpower. What can you share about what you've learned there and how to leverage that into doing great and being successful?

Mihika Kapoor (01:07:40):
For this one, I could actually maybe give an example that preceded my product career, which was, when I was in college, I actually founded a national design conference for students across the country. And the way that this came about was when I was in college, design was very much having a watershed moment in tech. So, companies like Airbnb and Pinterest were leading an industry and they were leading not just because they built technology and made it accessible, but because they were really using the interface layer to differentiate. So there was this point where software had reached a certain level of saturation, where things that were not possible were now suddenly possible, and now suddenly possible in multiple companies. And design became this differentiator, which is really exciting. But at the same time, none of this was reflected in most schools across the country.

Mihika Kapoor (01:08:39):
And so, I went to Princeton and there was nothing that resembled product design in our curriculum. And this was baffling to me, because I was like, "There is such clear momentum..." Speaking about momentum in industry about this being a profession that is so important and so influential in building the next generation of companies. Yet, the groundwork to make that happen wasn't really there. And then, I interned at Facebook, and I realized that my entire class of 25 interns had very similar experiences, where they too were self-taught product designers. And so, that summer, I actually watched a documentary that was coincidentally produced by Envision that featured folks like John Maeda, amongst others, and was talking about how design changed the world that we lived in, and was going to rewrite the future, which I really believed in. And so, I was incentivized to found this conference called Design Nation that would democratize access to a design education and bring together top students from across the country with industry leaders.

Mihika Kapoor (01:09:43):
And originally, my plan was to build this within an organization that already existed at Princeton, because they had the funding, they had the resources, they had the expertise in order to make this a reality. And then, what actually ended up happening was they too were skeptical of the business value of design and didn't think it would be possible for something like this to be funded. And so, I went from building something in a situation where I thought finances, expenditures, connections, et cetera, were totally taken care of, to having none of that and needing to build it from the ground up.

Mihika Kapoor (01:10:18):
And, it was funny, one of the best pieces of advice I got in college was, don't underestimate the power for .edu email address. And I just went on a spree, cold emailing so many people, so many executives about this problem that I was trying to solve. And, what actually ended up happening was people would hop on the phone with me, and a lot of the folks who I spoke to, designers who I really admire, like Daniel Burke, Jamie [inaudible 01:10:46], et cetera, were folks who would be like, "Oh my God, this was such a problem when I was in college. Of course I'll help you solve it. I can't believe it hasn't been solved yet."

Mihika Kapoor (01:10:56):
And so, ultimately, it grew into this conference that lasted many years, brought together folks from originally around the country, then more recently around the world. And ultimately, did live under that broader organization. But I think, having the ability to, in the absence of formal backing or something, still chase after something and maybe pivot the way that you're thinking about it, or pivot the way that you are allocating your own time. Maybe suddenly speakers is not the most important thing, fundraising is the most important thing. Or, building a hype landing page so that you seem more legit than a very scrappy few-person student organization is the most important thing. And just being quite adaptable when it comes to resourcing, I think is very important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:48):
That's an awesome example. It shows another trait, Mahika, in our archeological study, which has come up a bunch, and I'm just putting my finger on it, is just high agency. It feels like you're just consistently just like, "I'll make this happen myself. This problem exists. We need more product designers in school. I will solve that problem." And I love that. And by the way, Design Nation for folks that want to explore that, how do they find that? And it's still going, right?

Mihika Kapoor (01:12:19):
Yeah. So, you can Google Design Nation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):
Okay.

Mihika Kapoor (01:12:24):
And, we have a Instagram page amongst other things. And, yeah, last year we had folks like Stuart Weitzman and Joe Gebbia, who's one of the co-founders of Airbnb come and speak, which was super exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:37):
Awesome. And then, who is it for? It's for students? People in college that want to learn to be designers?

Mihika Kapoor (01:12:41):
Yeah, it's for design-driven college students. I think one thing to call out is that one of my focuses in the early years was to ensure that this is for, not just capital D designers, but design driven students. So, we also took engineers who are very design minded and marketers who are very design minded, et cetera, because of that core belief that the most innovative solutions will come out of people that are operating at this intersectionality.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:13):
Okay. So we've talked about all kinds of things you're amazing at. Before we transition to what you've learned about just building new stuff at larger companies, which you're very good at, can you just bullet point the skills you find you're not good at? I said we would come to this. What do you think you're not good at? And we won't go too deep here, unless you want.

Mihika Kapoor (01:13:34):
So it's interesting, because I think that there are many things that we talked about that are actually a double-edged sword in practice. So, let's start with the conviction piece. I think that the good thing about being high conviction is that you're able to sell forward and to get people to feel strongly about something and a next step in the future. I think the downside of that is if there is less of a history of working together, there might be skepticism about like, "Oh, are you just pushing something because you believe in it? Or are you pushing something because our users actually needed it?" And so, in those moments, it becomes really important to constantly be highlighting user proof points.

Mihika Kapoor (01:14:17):
I think, the second is scrappiness. So, I think I have a very high ability to thrive in ambiguity and to pull things together last minute. So, for example, it's very common that I am editing a product review deck minutes before we are about to present, or that I haven't started until the night before and stay up until 3:00 AM to do it. And this is somewhat fine. But then, I think that other people don't always love it, because they're like, "Hey, maybe let's start earlier next time." I get that. The third piece would be I get very consumed by the details of something. And I think in a lot of instances, this is great. Also, at a certain point, sometimes you want to defer those decisions. And so, that's also an important skill to learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):
Awesome. Thanks for sharing all that. This touches on something that came up in a previous podcast episode. Nikhil from Meta had this really interesting metaphor, where every superpower has a shadow. Basically, everything you're amazing at, there's something that'll be a problem, a liability basically for you. And so, I think, what you're pointing out is you're amazing at some of these things, but there's downsides. And I think that's really important for people to know. And we already talked about just something you believe that I also believe, it's just, you'll have things you're not good at, focus on things you're amazing at, and just getting better at those things, and use that to achieve, because it ends up being a lot more.

Mihika Kapoor (01:15:48):
Also, building off of that is as you scale your team, it's really important to be self-aware of what those blind spots are and to hire for that. Because, you want individuals to be spiky and you want team to be well-rounded.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:06):
That's a great segue to talking about building completely new things at large companies. So, what I hear is you're the go-to person for zero-to-one stuff at Figma, which is incredible. Figma is one of the most admired, successful tech companies in the world. And, you're the person people look to build completely new stuff. So, first of all, why are you so passionate about this stuff? Why do you want to be working on brand new stuff like this? And why is it important for companies to be good at this?

Mihika Kapoor (01:16:37):
In order for a company to stay competitive, a company needs to stay entrepreneurial. If you are not constantly thinking about what's next, defining the industry standard, seeing around the corner from your competitors, you will get taken over. That is a reality. And so, consequently, I personally love to screen for very entrepreneurial companies and companies that have that culture. And so, Figma has this huge run with it culture, where run with it is also one of our core values, and it's really encouraged that people can just sprint off in a direction that is seen not as a distraction, but rather a manifestation of the company's values.

Mihika Kapoor (01:17:22):
And so, at the company, some of our most monumental launches have come out of hackathons and have come out of bottoms up projects. So recently, this week we had a launch of Multi-edit, which was a long clamored for a feature where folks can edit things across multiple frames at the same time. That was a multi-year, multi-product long initiative. We have things like Jambot, which is an AI plugin inside of FigJam that has come out of an AI hackathon that we had last year. Our entire widgets platform was originally a hackathon project. And so, there's this culture of celebrating things-

Mihika Kapoor (01:18:03):
... project. And so there's this culture of celebrating things that have been pushed bottoms up. And so constantly thinking about how can people within the company be entrepreneurial, both in terms of getting new products up to users and in terms of improving internal processes, is just a culture that you constantly want to be facilitating and leading into.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:20):
Awesome. And clearly, Figma is very good at this. Let's dive a little deeper. Say, somebody wants to make their culture more entrepreneurial or wants to become better at this individually, maybe just broadly, what does it take to do this well, to go from idea to, "Okay, that's a huge new product for a business"? What have you learned just broadly, what are kind of the steps or the important elements of that, well?

Mihika Kapoor (01:18:46):
I think that there's this interesting metaphor that you were calling out earlier about a zero-to-one project being like a flame. And flames are interesting, because they're sort of destined to die at the end of the day. And I think about the person who is pushing a zero-to-one idea as kind of being the keeper of the flame.

Mihika Kapoor (01:19:13):
And in particular, there's this metaphor that really sticks with me, which is in Greek mythology, all the gods sit on Mount Olympus, and there's this Goddess Hestia who is the keeper of the hearth, and it is her job to always keep the hearth burning, even when all the gods peace out to go on their various quests. And I kind of think about the person or the team or the group of people who are pushing a zero-to-one idea as being the Hestias or the keepers of the hearth. And it is your job to stoke the flames and the embers if they are at risk of dying out. And it is also your job to ensure that the idea can spread like wildfire and can build that level of hype you need for an entire company or an entire set of people to be clamoring for something to get built.

Mihika Kapoor (01:20:04):
And so more concretely, I think that there are three things you need to do in order to be successful at bringing an idea into existence. The first is you need to have the right idea, right? And that's the empathy piece. That's the piece that you will get from having conversations day in, day out with your users. The second is you need to secure buy-in for that idea. So that's the vision piece. You need to be able to rally an entire set of folks, but honestly, most importantly, your leadership and your team behind an idea. And then, the third is you need to be able to make it spread like that wildfire. You need to get it to a point where someone joins the company and they're like, "Oh, what is that flame burning there? And how can I learn more about that?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:50):
Coming up with a great idea, getting buy-in for your idea, and then spreading it within the organization, what have you learned about how to actually come up with an idea that is actually a good idea?

Mihika Kapoor (01:20:59):
So it's funny because the current product that I'm working on actually came out of a conversation or a set of conversations where I was pitching FigJam to people. And so kind of speaking about constantly having these user conversations, I think in order to have the right idea, there are two key elements. The first is you need to have that user empathy. You need to be constantly having conversations with your users, diving into what are their pain points, not only about the product that you're working on, but general perceptions about your company and also general perceptions about the other tools or products that they might be using on a daily basis. It's not enough to have a perspective on how well you are competing in the market, but you also need to know, like understand a person's full end-to-end tooling usage.

Mihika Kapoor (01:21:48):
And then, the second thing is you need to ensure that what you're kind of working towards ladders into a company goal. And so something that's very top of mind at Figma or something that has been very top of mind at Figma has been how do we go from building for designers to covering the entire product development cycle and expanding to non-designers in particular. And non-designers is kind of this bucket term that we use for PMs and developers and marketers and so on and so forth, but how can we ensure that our tooling suite is reflective of all the different stakeholders that make the product development process what it is, and so I think that, yeah, just constantly having the conversation with the users and also constantly being anchored around not what are you currently working on, but what is the broader company goal is something that will help you come up with the right idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:48):
Such an important point, basically understanding the business, not just, "Here's my feature, here's my product, or here's what feels like a great cool thing to build." Okay, so that's the idea getting buy-in. What have you learned about how to do that? Well, clearly, you've been very successful, because we've talked about a lot of these things, building hype, creating a big vision. What else there that we haven't talked about that you think is really important?

Mihika Kapoor (01:23:12):
I think the key to being successful at zero-to-one is to honestly have optimism that borders on delusion. You need to have insane, almost like reality distortion field where you don't hear the word no, or at the very least, you translate it into a not yet. And so I think that in terms of pitching, I'll be honest, my first few pitches of this idea were not successful. What basically happened was kind of like both conviction, the idea by talking to users, and then I would have ad hoc conversations with folks around the company, and I would be like, "We should do this." And they would be like, "Maybe." And I would be like, "Okay, what am I seeing? What are they not seeing?" And then, what basically happened was we had a PM off-site where we were talking about strategy for the next year. And I, again, pitch this, and it got kind of momentum there, but not really.

Mihika Kapoor (01:24:15):
And then, I think the third time when it actually stuck was at the Maker Week hackathon. And this was kind of an insane experience for me, because I was actually hosting our hackathon. So I was kind of working with our VP of design, Noah, in order to spread the word about like, "Hey, everyone pitch your ideas." And to constantly, hackathons are interesting when they're virtual, right? Because you don't really know what people not in your office are doing, right? So you're constantly thinking about like, "Okay, how can you hype up the whole company, right? How can you hype up the SF office with what people are building in New York? And how can you ensure that London stays included even though there's a limited time zone overlap," and things like that. And so I was simultaneously thinking about, "Okay, how do we keep the momentum of this hackathon running? And then, also, how do I push this idea bottoms up?"

Mihika Kapoor (01:25:05):
And I think that something that's really important when you're making a pitch is to not be daunted by the scale of your pitch. So, for example, in this instance, the proposal was basically to introduce a new product. And building a product in a week is for all intents and purposes kind of crazy, but this is I think where the scrappiness piece comes in. You need to be willing to be very clear about where you're willing to take the hit on quality or believability and where you need to push in order to make your thing feel believable. So one example of something that we did was we literally, in order to make this new product feel more real, and this was maybe a two line change in code, was we swapped out the FigJam icon in our file browser to this new icon.

Mihika Kapoor (01:26:00):
And adding a whole new entry point is a lot of work, and you can't do that. But just swapping something and taking about what exists and changing the minor things in order to communicate what is different about your idea versus what exists today is something that you really want to lean into. And what basically happened was that at the end of the week, we had this demo day, and I was going between introducing each of the demos to doing the demo and did a little wardrobe change in between. And I think that what ended up being really great about presenting an idea like this in a company-wide forum, which I highly recommend, is that at that point, it becomes not just you evangelizing the idea, but your teammates and your colleagues and your peers evangelizing the idea. And that sense of momentum carries a lot of weight, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:48):
And this kind of leads into the next bullet point you shared of spreading the idea across the company. It feels like this is part of it just getting it spread in a big powerful way initially. But what else have you learned about just getting this to spread across the company? It gets kind of like this flame spreading throughout the organization.

Mihika Kapoor (01:27:05):
I think something that's very unique about Figma as compared to other companies is we have a multi-month plus long staging or dogfooding process. And so something that was really interesting to me was... One of the first projects that I worked on at the company was we were building sections inside of FigJam. And we had a problem. We built it. We put something on staging, and I was kind of like, "Okay, cool, it's been on staging a week, now we can launch, right?" And I was greeted with like, "No, we can't launch."

Mihika Kapoor (01:27:41):
And I think that leaning into that willingness to being vulnerable about your product and this acknowledgement that feedback is a gift, and that bits and pieces of feedback from across the company will help your product mature and get to a place where it's ready to go out the door is really important. And what's really interesting is this helps the team who's working on the product, because you're getting feedback, and that's the most direct benefit of putting something on staging early.

Mihika Kapoor (01:28:11):
But the other benefit about putting something on staging early is that it makes people invested in your product. So if you think about why are betas so valuable and why are alphas so valuable, it's because when someone gives you feedback, and then the team in charge implements that change, you see that and you're like, "I shaped that part of the product." Right? And to the extent that you can get as many people in the company feeling like they shaped X, Y, Z parts of the product, I think that's really powerful, because, then, you kind of are ensuring that there's this constant feedback loop, and there's this constant investment in thinking about how can we collectively drive towards success, because at the end of the day, product development is a team sport, right? It takes everyone to make something successful. And so I just think about putting things early on staging and getting people involved in the cycle as opening up the doors to the product development process, and hopefully, that just elevates the quality of the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:15):
Is there anything else you want to touch on or share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Mihika Kapoor (01:29:22):
If you have an insight that only you have, I think on one hand, you can kind of believe, "Oh, other people aren't thinking similar to me. Therefore, maybe, I'm wrong," but I would actually flip that, because I think if you have an insight that other people are not seeing, it is even more on you to get people onto the same page. And so to the extent that you can shout from the rooftops about all the insights that you're learning, I think that, in and of itself, creates a more entrepreneurial culture within the company, because chances are other people will see you doing that. They'll be inspired to contribute in the same way as well.

Mihika Kapoor (01:29:58):
I think the last thing that I would say is, which is maybe an aspect that we did not touch on, is that understanding motivations is, in my opinion, one of the keys to running a team successfully and driving an idea forward. So, for example, if you think about the composition of a product team, you have engineers, you have designers, you have researchers, data scientists, et cetera, and different people want to be involved in the kind of product visioning phase to a different extent. There's some people who do want a solution handed to them, because for them, the most exciting part of the process is to find the technical solution in the code. On the other hand, there are other people who find it really hard to feel passionately about a thing that they have not contributed to. And so I think to the extent that you can understand these motivations of your team, of your leadership, of your peers, and constantly ensure that you are catering to the individual, as opposed to the average, that is what, in my opinion, leads to one of the highest-functioning teams.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:11):
Such a cool point. It comes back to the personality tests that you spoke of earlier. Is that the best way to figure this out? Is it more just watch people and try to guess at what they're most excited about [inaudible 01:31:21]-

Mihika Kapoor (01:31:21):
Oh, I think you have to directly ask them. So anytime someone joins my team, especially on the engineering side, because I think this is where there's the greatest variance, I will literally ask, " How much do you like being involved in product decisions?" And to the extent that you can take decisions in the open, that is excellent. And even if the decision is something along the lines of like, "Okay, we have four options," and you can go in with a leading point of view, but giving everyone the opportunity to voice their perspective and push back, if they want to, I think that that's very powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:03):
Such a good tip. I feel like I could ask you questions for at least two more hours, but we're not going to do that. Maybe, we'll have round two some day. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Mihika Kapoor (01:32:14):
I am ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:16):
Mihika, first question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Mihika Kapoor (01:32:21):
Yeah, I'll start by saying that I am immediately skeptical of anyone who has not read Harry Potter. So, if you're one of those people, go read Harry Potter. Maybe, it contributes to creativity. I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:35):
Now, we're talking about every book in the series, or at least the one book?

Mihika Kapoor (01:32:38):
No, no. You have to read the entire series, and you have to read it in order. It's actually funny, when I was in kindergarten, my mom bought the fifth book, and then the person at the bookstore was like, "No, no." Like, "No, no." We were like, "Okay, got it." And then, the others that I would recommend are from a fiction perspective. I think Pachinko by Min Jin Lee is incredibly beautiful and powerful. It's like a multi-generational Korean saga. I think I'm personally just motivated and moved by large scale things. So to see a single story traverse so many generations was very fascinating to me.

Mihika Kapoor (01:33:17):
And then, from a more businessy book perspective, which is maybe more what you're getting at, I think that I honestly pseudo steer clear of how-to books, but one that has had a particularly large impact on me is Creativity Inc. by Ed Catmull. And this is about the founding story and scaling of Pixar. And what was so interesting to me about this book was it basically talks about how you create a process around cultivating creativity. And it's interesting, because creativity is so unencumbered and process is the opposite, so that's very fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:50):
My favorite lesson from that book is that it sticks with me as the ugly baby metaphor, which feels like so tied to the way you think and operate. And I won't get into it. By the way, have you read The Overstory?

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:01):
I have not. I'll add that to my list.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:04):
I feel like, based on the way you described Pachinko, this is a book for you. It's a multi-generational family story that I did not actually finish. It's very long, but I feel like you were there.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:16):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:16):
There you go.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:16):
I'll go order it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:19):
Okay. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:22):
Favorite recent TV show would definitely be Severance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):
Movie, or shall we move on?

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:29):
Oh, movie, I recently watched Dune 2 and Dune 1 in the span of a week. It was really fun. I watched Dune 2, because someone asked me to co-host a premiere of Dune 2 with them, and I was like, "Okay, sounds good, sounds cool, but I need to watch Dune 1."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:44):
Good choice. I just watched Dune 2. I don't know if a more epic movie can be made. I was just gripped.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:50):
The visuals were stunning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:52):
Like not breathing.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:53):
It's out of control. I watched it IMAX. I think that was a good call, but it was stressful. Favorite interview question they like to ask folks when you're hiring.

Mihika Kapoor (01:35:02):
I like to ask people what motivates them, but also, people often ask me, what is my favorite hot seat question, which I think is kind of similar. And my answer to that is that it's highly dependent on the person, and there's no go-to hot seat question. And I almost feel the same way about interview questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:19):
Favorite product you recently discovered that you love?

Mihika Kapoor (01:35:23):
Speaking about hype, I am kind of obsessed with the browser company, Arc onboarding flow, specifically the onboarding flow. I think that they do such a good job of amping you up for not only the larger change that they're trying to make in terms of personal operating system, but of showing you to what extent their team thinks about the details of the product, where a lot of other products might cut corners. And I think their ability to communicate the ethos of their product through that is really powerful. So that's one.

Mihika Kapoor (01:36:01):
And then I think the second is in the AI space. I'm really excited by Pika, which is video generation, video editing software. I think that, in my mind, one of the biggest shortcomings of AI, the way that a lot of people are building it today is that it's optimized for the demo or optimized for the tweet, right? And it's basically this situation where I think about it as, in my mind, one of the biggest goals of AI right now is the black boxification of AI, because it's not really useful to enter a prompt and get an output that you can't interact with, because then it's like, if something's a little bit off, what are you going to do? You're kind of stuck. But I think Pika is doing a really great job of not just investing in the foundational video models, but also giving you the ability to manipulate the output. And so I'm excited about that approach, and I hope that more companies take you from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:55):
Awesome, good choices on Arc. Whenever anyone ask me for a great onboarding follow, that's the one I point people to. And we had Josh Miller on the podcast in the past, and I was proud that he pinned our interview as top of his Twitter feed for a year, which made me really happy. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends or family that you find useful in life or in work?

Mihika Kapoor (01:37:19):
Yeah, "Life is a game of expectations." And so speaking of books and movies and things like that, I will never ever watch a movie trailer or read the back cover of a book, because I think it means that you're going into it with too many expectations. It either tells you all the punchlines, or it tells you the foundational backstory or something like that. And I think that, to the extent, that you go in either with no expectations or low expectations, that's the key to enjoying life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:48):
I love that tip. I recently learned the same piece of advice from Kevin Kelly's recent book where it's just a book of little tidbits of advice that he's learned over his life, and one of them is like never watch the trailer if you're going to watch the movie, and I've been doing that ever since. I think that's an awesome piece of advice. Final question. We talked about the Figgy's. You mentioned there's an award for PM least likely to write a PRD. Was that you won the award for chance?

Mihika Kapoor (01:38:10):
I think it was me and Sho tied.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:15):
Okay, great. I guessed correctly. Amazing. Mihika, you're... Everything, I hope you'd be on this podcast, I feel like, we could have talked for, I keep saying this, but at least two more hours maybe, we'll have a follow-up.

Mihika Kapoor (01:38:25):
I'd love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:25):
Thank you so much for being here and for making time. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and follow up on anything? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Mihika Kapoor (01:38:33):
Yeah, you can find me on Twitter. I'm @mihikapoor. It's kind of my first name and last name smushed together. And in terms of how users can be useful to me, so one is come to Config, we will be announcing both this new product, but also so many cool things that the company is working on. A lot of very exciting AI launches and more. And I think that having the community come together is a very special moment. So hope to see you there. Cough, cough, try the new product when it comes out. And I don't know, I'm always on the lookout for cool new products. I like to be someone who tries things out early, so to the extent that you see things, send them my way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:14):
There's going to be so many people anticipating this new product.

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:17):
Oh, no, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:17):
There's going to be like-

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:17):
We should-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:17):
... holy moly.

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:19):
Please have low expectations.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:22):
Okay. And the way we'll know is are you pitching and presenting it, or how do we know this is going to be your product once we see it?

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:28):
It'll probably be in the opening keynote, which is done by Dylan, but I'll probably give a Config talk on it as well. So that's how you will know, and I'll probably tweet about it. What I was actually going to do is to release the original vision deck when it launches, so you can look out for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:50):
We'll be watching. I will be at Config.

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:52):
Can't wait to see you there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:54):
Potentially on stage. Can't reveal yet what's happening exactly, but I think it's going to be awesome. Anyway, Mihika, thank you again so much for being here.

Mihika Kapoor (01:40:02):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. This was such a fun conversation. It was such an honor and a privilege to be on the podcast. So, really, thank you so much for having me.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
90% of your code roughly is written by AI now.

Mike Krieger (00:00:03):
The team that works in the most futuristic way is the Claude Code team. They're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. We really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted. Over half of our pull requests are Claude Code generated. Probably at this point it's probably over 70% that it just completely blew out the expectations of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
You guys are at the edge of where things are heading.

Mike Krieger (00:00:28):
I had the very bizarre experience of I had two tabs open. It was AI 2027, and my product strategy, and it was this moment where I'm like, "Wait, am I the character in the story?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
It feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. How does that inform the way you think about product, strategy, and mission?

Mike Krieger (00:00:43):
I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. How do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
What's something that you've changed your mind about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading?

Mike Krieger (00:01:01):
I had this notion coming in like, "Yes, these models are great, but are they able to have an independent opinion?" And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today, my guest is Mike Krieger. Mike is chief product officer at Anthropic, the company behind Claude. He's also the co-founder of Instagram. He's one of my most favorite product builders and thinkers. He's also now leading product at one of the most important companies in the world, and I'm so thrilled to have had a chance to chat with him on the podcast. We chat about what he's changed his mind about most in terms of AI capabilities in the years since he joined Anthropic, how product development changes and where bottlenecks emerge when 90% of your code is written by AI, which is now true at Anthropic. Also, his thoughts on OpenAI versus Anthropic, the future of MCP, why he shut down Artifact, his last startup and how he feels about it. Also, what skills he's encouraging his kids to develop with the rise of AI. And we closed the podcast on a very heartwarming message that Claude wanted me to share it with Mike.

Last year, 1.3% of the global GDP flowed through Stripe. That's over $1.4 trillion and driving that huge number are the millions of businesses growing more rapidly with Stripe. For industry leaders like Forbes, Atlassian, OpenAI, and Toyota, Stripe isn't just financial software. It's a powerful partner that simplifies how they move money, making it as seamless and borderless as the internet itself. For example, Hertz boosted its online payment authorization rates by 4% after migrating to Stripe. And imagine seeing a 23% lift in revenue like Forbes did just six months after switching to Stripe for subscription management. Stripe has been leveraging AI for the last decade to make its product better at growing revenue for all businesses. From smarter checkouts to fraud prevention and beyond. Join the ranks of over half of the Fortune 100 companies that trust Stripe to drive change, learn more at Stripe.com.

(00:04:29):
Mike, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Mike Krieger (00:04:32):
I'm really happy to be here. I've been looking forward to this for a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):
Wow, I had love to hear that. I've also been looking forward to this for a while. I have so much to talk about. So first of all, you've been at Anthropic for just over a year at this point. Congrats by the way on hitting the cliff.

Mike Krieger (00:04:46):
Thank you. Not that we're tracking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):
That's right. So let me just ask you this. So you've been at Anthropic for about a year. What's something that you've changed your mind about from before you joined Anthropic to today about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading?

Mike Krieger (00:05:04):
Two things. One is like a pace and timeline question. The other one is a capability question. So maybe I'll take the second one first. I had this notion coming in, yes, these models are great, they're going to be able to produce code, they're going to be able to write hopefully in your voice eventually, but are they able to sort of have an independent opinion? And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month and only with Opus 4 where my go-to product strategy partner is Claude. And it has been basically for that full year where I'll write an initial strategy, I'll share it with Claude basically, and I'll have it, look at it. And in the past it's pretty anodyne kind of comments that it would leave, "Oh, have you thought about this?" And it's like, "Yeah, I thought about that." And Opus 4, I was working on some strategy for our second half of the year was the first one.

(00:05:51):
It was like Opus 4 combined with our advanced research. But it really went out for a while and it came back and I was like, you really looked at it in a new way. And so that's a thing that I've maybe I didn't feel like it would never be able to do that, but I wasn't sure how soon it'd be able to come up with something where I look at it, I'm like, yep, that is a new angle that I hadn't been looking at before and I'm going to incorporate that immediately into how I think about it. So that's probably the biggest shift that I've had is, I don't know about independence is the right word, but creativity and sort of novelty of thought relative to how I'm thinking about things. But in the timeline, one, it's so interesting because I was sitting next to Dario yesterday and he's like, "I keep making these predictions and people keep laughing at me. And then they come true."

(00:06:31):
And it's funny to have this happen over and over again and he is like, not all of them are going to be right. But even I think as of last year he was talking about we're at 50% on SWE-Bench, which is this benchmark around how well the models are at coding. He's like, "I think we'll be at 90% by the end of 2025 or something like that." And sure enough, we're at about 72 now with the new models and we're at 50% when he made that prediction. And it's continued to scale pretty much as predicted. And so I've taken the timelines a lot more seriously now. And I don't know if you read AI 2027-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:05):
I have, it made by heart race.

Mike Krieger (00:07:09):
And I had the very bizarre experience of I had two tabs open, it was AI 2027 and my product strategy. And it was this moment where I'm like, "Wait, am I the character in the story? How much is this converging?" But you read that and you're like, "Oh, 2027, that's years away if you're like no, mid 2025." And things continue to improve and the models continue to be able to do more and more and they're able to act agentically and they're able to have memory and they're able to act over time. So I think my confidence in the timelines and I don't know exactly how they manifest it definitely just solidified over the last year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:43):
Wow. I wasn't expecting to go down that that paper was scary. And I'm curious just I guess I can't help but ask just thoughts on just how do we avoid the scary scenario that paper paints of where AI getting really smart goes?

Mike Krieger (00:07:59):
Yeah, this maybe ties into, I've been here a year, why did I join Anthropic? I was watching the models get better and even you could see it in early 2024, and looking at my kids, I'm like, "All right, they're going to grow up in a world with AI. It's unavoidable." Where can I maximally apply my time to nudge things towards going well? And I mean that's a lot of what people think about across the industry, especially at Anthropic. And so I think coming to an agreement and a shared framework and understanding of what does going well look like? What is the kind of human AI relationship that we want?

(00:08:36):
How will we know along the way? What do we need to build and develop and research along the way? I think those are all the kind of key questions. And some of those are product questions and some of those are research and interpretability questions, but for me it was the strongest reason to join was okay. I think there's a lot of contribution that Anthropic can have around nudging things to go better. And if I can have a part to play there, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:00):
I love that answer. Speaking of kids, so you've got two kids, I've got a young kid, he's just about to turn two. I'm curious just what skills you're encouraging your kids to build as this AI becomes more and more of our future and some jobs will be changed and just what advice do you have?

Mike Krieger (00:09:18):
We have this breakfast feed breakfast with the kids every morning and sometimes some question will come up, something about physics and our oldest kid's almost six, but they ask funny questions about the solar system or physics or in a 6-year-old way and before we reach for Claude, because at first my instinct is like, "Oh, I wonder how Claude will do this question." And we started changing, "Well, how would we find out?" And the answer can't just be we'll ask Claude, all right, well, we could do this experiment, we could have this thing. So I think nurturing curiosity and still having a sense of, I don't know, the scientific process sounds grandiose to instill in a 6-year-old, but that process of discovery and asking questions and then systematically working right through, I think will still be important. And of course AI will be an incredible tool for helping resolve large parts of that, but that process of inquiry I think is still really important and independent thought.

(00:10:11):
My favorite moment with my kid, because she's very headstrong, our 6-year-old, she said something and I wasn't sure if it was true. It was, oh, is that coral is an animal or corals alive? I don't even remember what the details of it. And I was like, "I don't know if that's true." And she's like, "It's definitely true, dad." I'm like, "All right, let's ask Claude on this one." And she's like, "You can ask Claude, but I know I'm right." And I'm like I love that. I want that kind of level of not just delegating all of your cognition to the AI because it won't always get it right. And also it kind of short circuits any kind of independent thought. So the skill of asking questions, inquiry and independent thinking, I think those are all the pieces. What that looks like from a job or occupation perspective, I'm just keeping an open mind and I'm sure that'll radically change between now and then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):
It's interesting. Tobias Lütke, Shopify CEO, on the podcast and he had the same answer for what he's encouraging his kids to develop is curiosity. And so it's interesting that's a common thread.

Mike Krieger (00:11:14):
The K through eight school our kid goes through had an AI and education expert come in and I had a very low bar or a very low expectation of what this conversation was going to be like. And actually I think it went over most of the people in the audience's heads because he was like, "All right, well let me take you all the way back to Claude Shannon in information theory." And I could see people's eyes going, "What did I sign up for and why am I hearing this school auditorium hearing about information theory?" But he did a really nice job I think of also just imagining there will be different jobs and we don't know what those jobs are going to be and so what are the skills and techniques and remain open mindedness around what the exact way we recombine those things. And even those will probably change three times between now and when they're 18.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:59):
So we're talking about timelines and how things are changing. So I've seen these stats that you've shared, other folks at Anthropic have shared about how much of your code is now written by AI. So people have shared stats from 70% to 90%. There was an engineer lead that shared 90% of your code roughly is written by AI now, which first of all is just insane that it went from zero to 90%, I don't know, a few years, something like that. Yeah, basically. I don't think people are talking about this enough. That's just wild. You guys are basically at the bleeding edge. I've never heard a company that has this high a percentage of code being written by AI.

(00:12:34):
So you guys are at the edge of where things are heading. I think most companies will get here. How has product development changed knowing so much of your code is now written by AI, so usually it's like PM, it's like here's what we're building, engineer builds it, it ships it. Is it still kind of roughly that or is it now PMs are just going straight to Claude, build this thing for me, engineers are doing different things? Just what looks different in a world where 90% of your code is written by AI?

Mike Krieger (00:12:57):
Yeah, it's really interesting because I think the role of engineering has changed a lot, but the suite of people that come together to produce a product hasn't yet. And I think for the worst in a lot of ways because I think we're still holding on some assumptions. So I think the roles are still fairly similar, although we'll now get in my favorite things that happen now are some nice PMs that have an idea that they want to express or designers that have an idea they want to express will use Claude and maybe even Artifacts to put together an actual functional demo. And that has been very, very helpful. No, no, this is what I mean that makes it tangible. That's probably the biggest role shift is prototyping happening earlier in the process via more of this code plus design piece. What I've learned though is the process of knowing what to ask the AI, how to compose the question, how to even think about structuring a change between the backend and the front end.

(00:13:54):
Those are still very difficult and specialized skills and they still require the engineer to think about it. And we really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue, which is the get in line to get your change accepted by the system that then deploys into production. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted that it just completely blew out the expectations of it. And so it's like, I don't know if you've ever read, is it the goal, the classic process optimization book, and you realize there's this critical path theory. I've just found all these new bottlenecks in our system, there's an upstream bottleneck, which is decision making and alignment. A lot of things that I'm thinking about right now is how do I provide the minimum viable strategy to let people feel empowered to go run and type and build and explore at the edge of model capabilities.

(00:14:44):
I don't think I've gotten that right yet, but that's something I'm working on. And then once the building is happening, other bottlenecks emerge, let's make sure we don't step on each other's toes. Let's think through all the edge cases here ahead of time so that we're not blocked on the engineering side. And then when the work is complete and we're getting ready to ship it, what are all those bottlenecks as well? Let's do the air traffic control of landing the change. How do we figure out large strategy? So I think there hasn't been as much pressure on changing those until this year, but I would expect that a year from now the way that we are conceiving of building and shipping software just changes a lot because it's going to be very painful to do it the current way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:20):
Wow, that is extremely interesting. So it used to be here's an idea, let's go design it, build it, ship it, merge it, and then ship it. And usually the bottleneck was engineering, taking time to build a thing and then design. And now you're saying the two bottlenecks you're finding are okay deciding what to build and aligning everyone and then it's actually the cue to merge it into production. And I imagine review it too is probably a part-

Mike Krieger (00:15:47):
Reviewing has really changed too. And in many ways perhaps unsurprisingly the team that works in the most futuristic way is the Claude Code team because they're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. And early on in that project, they would do very line by line pull request reviews in the way that you would for any other project. And they've just realized Claude is generally right and it's producing pull requests that are probably larger than most people are going to be able to review. So can you use a different Claude to review it and then do the human almost acceptance testing more than trying to review line by line. There's definitely pros and cons and so far it's gone well. But I could also imagine it going off the rails and then having a completely both unmaintainable or even understandable by Claude Code base that hasn't happened, but watching them change their review processes definitely has been interesting.

(00:16:38):
And yeah, the merge queue is one instance of the bottom bottleneck that forms down there, but there's other ones which is how do we make sure that we're still building something coherent and packaging it up into a moment that we can share with people and whether that's around a launch moment, whether that's about then enabling people to use this thing and talking about it, the classic things of building something useful for people and then making it known that you've built it and then learning from their feedback still exists. We've just made a portion of that whole process much more efficient.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):
I heard you describe this as you guys are patient zero for this way of working.

Mike Krieger (00:17:11):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):
I love that. Do you have a sense of what percentage of Claude Code is written by Claude Code?

Mike Krieger (00:17:17):
At this point, I would be shocked if it wasn't 95% plus. I'd have to ask Boris and the other tech leads on there. But what's been cool is so nitty-gritty stuff, Claude Code is written in TypeScript. It's actually our largest TypeScript project. Most of the rest of Anthropic is written in Python, some Go, some Rust now, but we're not like a TypeScript shop. And so I saw a great comment yesterday in our Slack where somebody had this thing that was driving them crazy about Claude Code and they're like, "Well, I don't know any TypeScript, I'm just going to talk to Claude about it and do it."

(00:17:49):
And they went from that to pull requests in an hour and solve their problem and they submitted a pull request and that breaking down the barriers. One, it changes your barrier to entry for any kind of newcomer to the project. I think it can let you choose the right language for the right job for example. I think that helps as well, but I think it also just reinforces Claude Code being that patient alpha of that where contributions from outside the team can be Claude coded as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:18):
Wow, this is, it's just continue to blow my mind all these things that you're sharing, 95% of Claude Code is written by Claude Code roughly.

Mike Krieger (00:18:27):
That's my guess. Yeah, I'll come back with the real stuff. But I mean if you ask the team, that's how they're working and that's how they're getting contributions from across the company too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:35):
It's interesting going back to your point about strategy being assisted by Claude itself and your point about how a lot of the bottlenecks now are kind of the top of the funnel of coming up with ideas aligning everyone, it's interesting that Claude is already helping with that also of helping you decide what to build. So if those two bottlenecks are aligning, deciding what to build and then just merging and getting everything, where do you see the most interesting stuff happening to help you speed those things up?

Mike Krieger (00:19:02):
Yeah, I think that on that first row, I started the year by writing a doc that was effectively how do we do product today and where is Claude not showing up yet that it should? And I think that upstream part is the next one to go. It's interesting. At your conference I talked to somebody who's working on a PRD, GPT kind of ChatPRD, I think was the-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:24):
ChatPRD, [inaudible 00:19:24].

Mike Krieger (00:19:24):
Yeah. Can Claude be a partner in figuring out what to build? What the market size is if you want to approach it that way? What the user needs are if you look at a different way? We think a lot about the virtual collaborator on topic and one of the ways in which I think that can show up is, "Hey, I'm in the Discord, the Claude Anthropic Discord, I'm in the user Fora, I'm on X and I'm reading things and here's what's emergent." That's step one. Models can do that today. Step two, which the models probably can do today, which have to wire them up to do it is and not only are the problems here's how I think you might be able to solve them. And then taking that through to, and I put together a pull request to solve this thing that I'm seeing feels very achievable this year than stringing those things together and we're limited more.

(00:20:13):
This is why MCP is exciting to me. We're limited more around making sure the context flows through all of that so we have the right access to those things more than the model's capability to reason and propose. Now the model might not have perfect UI taste yet, so there's definitely room for design to intervene and be like, "Oh, that's not quite how I would solve the problem of this not showing up." But I would get very excited. I would give you a really small example, but we changed on Claude AI, you should be able to just copy markdown from Artifacts or code from Artifacts and we changed it so you can actually download it and export it. We changed the button to export and we got a bunch of feedback like, "How do I copy now?" And the answer is you drop it down and it's copied.

(00:20:51):
It's just mind one of those things where it's made sense, but we probably got it not quite right. That feedback was in the RUX channel. I would've loved an hour later for a plot to be like, "Hey, if we do want to change it back, here's the PR to do it." And by the way, eventually, and then I'm going to spin up an A/B test to see if this changes metrics and then we'll see how it looks in a week. If you told me that about a year and a half ago going to be like, "Ah, yeah, maybe like 27, maybe 26." But it really feels just at the tip of capabilities right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:20):
Wow, okay. You mentioned the Lenny and Friends Summit. I wanted to talk about this a bit. So you were on a panel with Kevin Weil, the CPO of OpenAI, I think it was the first time you guys did this maybe the last time for now.

Mike Krieger (00:21:32):
Yeah, we haven't done it since, not for any reason. I had a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:34):
What a legendary panel we assembled there with Sarah Guo moderating. And you made this comment actually ended up being the most rewatched part of the interview, which is that you were putting product people on the model team and working with researchers making the model better and you're putting some product people on the product experience making the UX more intuitive, making all that better. And you found that almost all the leverage came from the product team working with the researchers. And so you've been doing more of that. So first of all, does that continue to be true? And second of all, what are the implications of that for product teams?

Mike Krieger (00:22:11):
It's continued to be true. And in fact I think that if the proportion was already skewing towards having more of that embedding, I've just become more and more convinced. I didn't feel as strongly about it during the summit and now I feel really strongly about it. If we're shipping things that could have been built by anybody just using our models off the shelf, there's great stuff to be built by using our models off the shelf by the way, don't get me wrong, but where we should play and what we can do uniquely should be stuff that's really at that magic intersection between the two, right?

(00:22:42):
Artifacts may a great example and if you play with Artifacts with Claude 4, that's an actually really interesting example where we took somebody from our, we have Claude code skills, which is a team that really is doing the post-training around teaching Claude some of these really specific skills and we paired it with some product people and then together we revamped how this looks in the product today and what Claude can do way better than just like, "Yeah, we just used the model and we prompted a little bit."

(00:23:07):
That's just not enough. We need to be in that fine-tuning process. So much of what, if you look at what we're working on right now, but we've shipped recently between research and all these other things are things that the functional unit of work at Anthropic is no longer take the model and then go work with design and product to go ship a product. It's more like we are in the post-training conversations around how these things should work and then we are in the building process and we're feeding those things back and looping them back.

(00:23:36):
I think it's exciting. It's also a new way of working that not all PMs have, but the PMs that have the most internal positive feedback from both research and engineering are the ones that get it that I was in a product review yesterday, I was like, "Oh, if we want to do this memory feature, we should talk to the researchers because we just shipped a bunch of memory capabilities in Claude 4." They're like, "Yeah, yeah, we've been talking to them for weeks, this is how we're manifesting it." It's like, "Okay, I feel good. I feel like we're doing the right things now."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):
So let me pull on this thread more and there's something I've been thinking about along these lines. So essentially there's a big part of entropic that's building this super intelligent giga brain that's going to do all these things for us over time. And then, as you said, there's the product team that's building the UX around this super intelligent giga brain and over time this super intelligence is going to be able to build its own stuff. And so I guess just where do you think the most value will come from traditional product teams over time? I know this is different because you guys are a foundational alum company and not most companies don't work this way, but just, I don't know, thoughts on just the where most value will come from product teams over time working on AI.

Mike Krieger (00:24:42):
I think there's still a lot of value in two things. One is making this all comprehensible. I think we've done an okay job. I think we could do a much better job of making this conference. What's still the difference between somebody who's really adept at using these tools in their work and most people is huge. And maybe that's the most literal answer to your earlier question around what skills to learn. That is a skill to learn and use it in the same way that I remember we did computer lock class when I was in middle school. I remember being really good at Google and that was actually a skill back in the day to think in terms of this information is out there, how do I query for it? How do I do it? I think it actually was an advantage at the time.

(00:25:21):
Of course now Google is pretty good at figuring out what you're trying to do if you are only in the neighborhood and there's less of that research kind of need. But I still think that's a necessary part of good product development, which is the capabilities are there and even if Claude can create products from scratch, what are you building and how do you make it Comprehensible? Still hard because I think that gets at this much deeper empathy and understanding of human needs and psychology. I was a human community interaction major, I still been talking in my book here. I still feel like that is a very, very, very, very necessary skill. So that's one. Two is, and this straight to call back to another one of your guests, strategy, how we win, where we'll play, figuring out where exactly you're going to want to, of all the things that you could be spending your time or your tokens or your computation on what you want to actually go and do.

(00:26:15):
You could be wider probably than you could before, but you can't do everything. And even from an external perspective, if you're seen to be doing everything, it's way less clear around how you're positioning yourselves. Like strategy I think is still the second piece. And then the third one is opening people's eyes to what's possible, which is a continuation of making it understandable. But we were in a demo with a financial services company recently and we were working on here's how you can use our analysis tool and MCP together and you could see their light up and you're like, "Ah, okay." We call it overhang. The delta between what the models and the products can do and how they're being used on a daily basis. Huge overhang. So that's where still a very, very strong necessary role for product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Okay, that's an awesome answer. So essentially areas for product teams to lean into more is strategy, just getting better and better at strategy, figuring out what to build and how to win in the market, making it easier to help people understand how to leverage the power of these tools, the comprehensibility and kind of along those lines is opening people's eyes to the potential of these sorts of things. That's where product can still help.

Mike Krieger (00:27:21):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):
Awesome. So along those lines actually, do you have any just prompting tricks for people, things that you've learned to get more out of Claude when you chat with it?

Mike Krieger (00:27:30):
Sometimes it's funny because in some ways we have the ultimate prompting job, which is to write the system prompt for Claudia AI and we publish all of these, which I think is another nice area of transparency. And we are always careful when giving prompting advice because at least officially, but I'll give you the unofficial version because you don't want things to become like we think this works, but we're not sure why. But I will do small things like in Claude Code and we actually do react to this very literally, but I always ask it to, if I wanted to use more reasoning, think hard and it'll use a different flow and I usually start with that. Nudging, there's a great essay around make the other mistake like if you tend to be too nice, can you focus on... Even if you're trying to be more critical or more blunt, you're probably not going to be the most critical blunt person in the world.

(00:28:18):
And so with Claude sometimes I'm like, "Be brutal, Claude, roast me. Tell me what's wrong with this strategy." I know we were talking earlier about the Claude as thought partner around critiquing product strategy. I think I previously would say things like, "What could be better on this product strategy?" And I'm just like, "Just roast this product strategy," and Claude's like a pretty nice entity. It's hard to push it to be super brutal, but it forces it to be a little bit more critical as well. The last thing I'll say is, so we have a team called Applied AI that does a lot of work with our customers around optimizing Claude for their use case. And we basically took their insights and their way of working and we put it into a product itself. So if you go to our console, our work bench, we have this thing called the prompt improver where you describe the problem and you give it examples and Claude itself will agentically create and then iterate on a prompt for you.

(00:29:09):
I find what comes out of that ends up being quite different than what my intuitions would've been for a good prompt. And so I'd encourage folks to also check that out even for their own use cases because while that tool is met for an API developer putting a prompt into their product, it's equally applicable for a person doing a prompt for themselves. It'll insert XML tags which no human is going to think to do ahead of time. It actually is very helpful for Claude to understand what it should be thinking versus what it should be saying, et cetera. So that's another one is watch our prompt improver and then note that Claude itself is a very good prompter of Claude.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:41):
Awesome. Okay, so we're going to link to that, the prompt improver. The core piece of advice you shared early is just do the opposite of what you would naturally do. So if you're trying to be nice, just be brutal, be very honest and frank with me.

Mike Krieger (00:29:53):
Exactly. I find that works quite well. What are the thought patterns that I've fallen into that you want to break me out of?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:59):
I saw you guys just today maybe launched a Rick Rubin collab where it said vibe coding. What's that all about?

Mike Krieger (00:30:06):
What I've heard about that. And again, a lot of the coalesce this week between model launch developer event and The Way of Code. We had one of our co-founders, Jack Clark is our head of policy and he got connected to Rick Rubin because I think he's been thinking a lot about coding, the future of coding and creativity and they've stayed in touch. And Rick got excited about this idea of he was creating art and visualizations with Claude and then he had these ideas around the way of the vibe coder and they put together this, actually I mean I love almost everything Rick Rubin. So the aesthetic of it I think is just so on point too. But yeah, this sort of like med meditation is probably the right word. Meditation on creativity, working alongside AI coupled with this really rich, interesting visualizations. But it's one of those things where internally they're like, "Oh yeah, and we're doing this Rick Rubin collab." We were like, "We're doing what? That's amazing."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:03):
I looked at it briefly and there's that meme of him just thinking deeply, sitting on a computer with a mouth.

Mike Krieger (00:31:09):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:10):
And ASCII art, I think.

Mike Krieger (00:31:11):
It's totally, it's like ASCII art vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Speaker 3 (00:31:21):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:23):
So what is new with one schema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.

Speaker 3 (00:31:39):
Yes, so we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?

Speaker 3 (00:32:13):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:34):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:32:48):
Actually going back to the beginning of your journey at Anthropic, what's the story of you getting recruited at Anthropic? Is there anything fun there?

Mike Krieger (00:32:55):
It all started and I actually sent my friend this text. So Joel Lewenstein, who I've known, he and I built our first iPhone apps together in 2007 when the App Store was just out and you could still make money by selling dollar apps on the App Store back in the day. And we were both at Stanford together and we were friends and we've stayed in touch over years and we've never gotten to work together since then. We've just remained close. And I was coming out of the Artifact experience, I was trying to figure out, do I start another company? I don't think so. I need a break from starting something from zero. Do I go work somewhere? I don't know what company would I want to go work at. And he reached out and he's like, "Look, I don't know if you at all considered joining something rather than starting something, but we're looking for a CPO. Would you be interested in chatting?"

(00:33:37):
And at that time, Claude 3 had just come out and I was like, "Okay, this company's clearly got a good research team. The product is so early still." And it was like, "Great, I'll take the meeting." And I first met with Daniela, was one of the co-founders and the president in Anthropic. And just from the beginning I was like a breath of fresh air, very little grandiosity coming off the founders, I mean they're clear-eyed about what they're building. They know what they don't know. How many times I talk to Dario always like Dario is like, "Look, I don't know anything about product, but here's an intuition." Usually the intuition is really good and leads to some good conversation, but I think that intellectual honesty and shared view of what it means to do AI in a responsible way, it just resonated.

(00:34:22):
I kept having this feeling in these interviews, this is the AI company I would've hoped to have found it if I had founded an AI company. And that's kind of the bar around if I'm going to join something that should be where I'm going to go. But what I realized, I actually hadn't joined a company since my first internship in college basically. And I was like, "Oh, how do I onboard myself? How do I get myself up to speed? How do I balance making sweeping changes versus understanding what's not broken about it overall?" And looking back on a year, I think I made some changes too slowly. I think there was ways reorganizing product that I could have made a change earlier. And I think I didn't appreciate how much a couple of really key senior people can shape so much of product strategy.

(00:35:10):
I'll harken back to Claude Code. Claude Code happened because Boris, who actually was a Boris Cherney, he was an Instagram engineer and one of our senior ICs there, we overlapped a bit, was started that project from scratch internal first and then we got it out and then shipped it. And that's the power of one or two really strong people. And I made this mistake, we need more headcount and we do, I think there's more work that we need to do and there's things that I want to be building. But more than that we need a couple of almost founder type engineers that maybe connect back to our question on what skills are useful and how does product development change. And maybe even more so I'm a huge believer in the founding engineer tech lead with an idea and pair them with the right design and product supports, help them realize that, I'm 10 times more a believer in that than before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):
I actually asked people on Twitter what to ask you ahead of this conversation. And the most common question surprisingly was why did you shut down Artifact? And I also wondered that because I loved Artifact. I was a power user. I was just like, "Finally a news app that I love that it's giving me what I want to know." So I guess just what happened there at the end?

Mike Krieger (00:36:20):
I still really miss it too. I didn't find a replacement and I think I substituted it by visiting individual sites and keeping things up that way. And it's not really the same, especially on the log to I think we got right with Artifact and if people didn't play with it before, it was we really tried to not just recommend top stories, they were part of it. But really if you were interested in Japanese architecture, you could pretty reliably get really interesting stories about Japanese architecture every day. Whether that's from a Dwell or from Architectural Digest or from a really specific blog that we found that somebody recommended to us. It captured some of that Google reader joy of content discovery of the deeper web. Our headwinds were a couple. One of them was just mobile websites have really taken a turn. I don't blame any individuals for this.

(00:37:10):
I think it's the market dynamics of it, but we put so much time or designers, sky Gunner Gray who's phenomenal that for Perplexity now, the app experience I was so proud of, but when you click through it was like the pressures on these mobile sites and these mobile publishers would be like, "Sign up for our newsletter. Here's a full screen video ad." It was very jarring and we didn't feel like it ethically made sense for us to do a bunch of ad blocking because then you're like, "Sure, you can deliver a nice experience for people, but that doesn't feel like it's playing fair with the publishers." But at the same time, the actual experience wasn't good. So the mobile web deteriorating, which makes me very sad, but I think was part of it. Two was Instagram spread in the early days because people would take photos and then post them on other networks and tell friends about it.

(00:37:57):
And there was this really natural like, "How did you do that? I want to do it." News was very personal. I can't tell you how many people would be like, "I love Artifact." I'm like, "Did you tell anybody about it?" And they're like, "I told one person," and it didn't have that kind of spread. And any attempt that we had to do it felt kind of contrived, like, "Oh, we'll wrap all the links in artifact.news." But we didn't want interstitial things. In some ways, this sounds very puritanical, I don't mean it to sound this way, but there were lines that we didn't want to cross that just felt ethically not us, that I've seen other news players do more of. And maybe if we had done that, it would've grown more, but I don't think that's the company we wanted to have built other way. I don't think we were the founders to have built it.

(00:38:39):
And the third one, which is an underappreciated one, is we started at mid-COVID, which meant that we were fully distributed and I think there were major shifts that we would've wanted to make both in the strategy and the product and the team. And it's really hard to do that if you are all fully remote. Nothing replaces the Instagram days of we went through some hard times like Ben Horowitz called the we're F'ed, it's over kind of moments. This is definitely type two fun. I wouldn't say that my favorite memories because they weren't happy ones, but memories I really stayed with me with Instagram was like me and Kevin at Taqueria, Cancun on Market Street eating burritos at literally 11:00 PM being like, "How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to work through this?" And Zoom is not a good replica for that.

(00:39:26):
You tend to let things go or things build up over time. So the confluence of those three things, we entered I guess 2024 and said, "Look, there is a company to be built in the space. I'm not sure where the people would've built it. This concurrent incarnation we love, but it's not growing." The way I put it's like 10 units of input in for one unit of output versus the other way around. If we put blood and tears into the product and launch something we were proud of and metrics would barely move, the energy is not present in this product, in this system. And so are we going to expend another year or two and then go off and fundraise only to find that this is the case or do we call it and see that it's run its course and try to find a home for it, et cetera.

(00:40:06):
So that was the confluence on it and they started feeling this opportunity cost of AI is starting to change everything. We have an AI powered news app, but is this the maximal way in which we're going to be able to impact this? And it felt like the answer was increasingly no. But it was hard. I mean in the end I was really at peace of the decision, but it was a conversation that went on for a couple of months.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:26):
On that note, just how hard was it because because there's an ego component to it, like, "Oh, I'm starting my new company, it's going to be great," and then you end up having to shut it down. Just how hard is that as a very successful previous founder shutting something down and then not working out?

Mike Krieger (00:40:41):
Yeah, I mean I think when we started it, one of the conversations was like, "Look, what is the bar to success here? And do we want it to be something other than Instagram DAU?" Which is just an impossible bar. Only one company since, maybe two, you could say maybe ChatGPT and TikToK have reached that kind of mass consumer adoption starting a news app. Most people are not daily news readers even, right? And so we knew that we weren't pursuing that size of usage, at least with the first incarnation, but we did have an idea of building out complementary products over time that all use personalization and machine learning. We didn't even call it AI at the time. It was 2021 back-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):
Yeah, yeah, AI, it was called machine learning back then.

Mike Krieger (00:41:19):
Yeah, it was called machine learning still. And so in shutting it down, you know it when you see it in terms of user growth and traction. And I wasn't expecting Instagram growth, but I was expecting or hoping for or looking for something that felt like at its own legs under it and it could continue to compound. I was really positively surprised by how supportive people were when we announced it. There was a bit of like I told you so which sure anything launching you could be like, "This is not going to work." And you're right, most of the time most things don't work. There was actually very little of that. And most people, the universal reception, at least as I received it, was kudos for calling it when you saw it and not protracted doing this for a long time.

(00:42:05):
And I've talked to founders since then that have been like, "Yeah, I probably would've taken this thing on for another six months, but saw what you guys did, realized we were barking up the wrong tree, made the call." And I was like, "If that frees up people to go work on a more interesting things, I feel like that's a good legacy for Artifact to have." But for sure there was an ego bruise of is it true that you're only as good as your last game if I am a huge sports fan, right? So is that true or is there something more over a time? I'm very competitive, but primarily with myself and so I'm always trying to find the next thing that I want to go and do that's hard. And unfortunately that probably means that more often than not I'll feel dissatisfied, but the most recent thing that I did, but hopefully that yields good stuff in the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:50):
Yeah, I think just the trajectory you went on after shows that it's okay to shut down things that you were working on. Okay, so you mentioned ChatGPT. I wanted to chat about this a bit. So there's something really interesting happening. So on the one hand you guys are doing some of the most innovative work in AI. You guys launched MCP, which is just, I don't know, the fastest growing standard of any time in history that everyone's adopting Claude powered and unlocked centrally the fastest growing companies in the world, Cursor, Lovable, and Bolt, and all these guys. I had them on the podcast and they're all like, "When Claude, I think 3.5 came out, Sonnet, was just like that's made this work finally."

(00:43:28):
On the other hand, it feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. When people think AI, especially outside tech, it's just like ChatGPT in their mind. So let me just ask you this, I guess first of all, do you agree with that sentiment and then two, as a challenger brand in the AI space, just how does that inform the way you think about product strategy and mission and things like that?

Mike Krieger (00:43:50):
Yeah, I mean you look at the sort of public adoption or if you ask people, oh, if you Jimmy Kimmel man on the street kind of thing, name an AI company, I bet they would name and actually I'm not even sure they name open AI, they'd probably name ChatGPT because that brand is the lead brand there as well. And I think that's just the reality of it. I think that when I reflect on my year, I think maybe two things are true. One is consumer adoption is really lightning in a bottle and we saw it at Instagram. So almost maybe more than anybody, I can look internally and say, "Look, we'll keep building interesting products. One of them may hit." But to craft an entire product strategy around trying to find that hit is probably not wise, we could do it and maybe Claude can help come up with a fullness of things, but I think we'd miss out an opportunity in the meantime.

(00:44:41):
And then instead look yourself in the mirror and embrace who you are and what you could be rather than who others are is maybe the way I've been looking at it, which is we have a super strong developer brand, people build on top of us all the time, and I think we also have a builder brand. The people who I've seen react really well to Claude externally. Maybe the Rick Rubin connection has some resonance here as well. Can we lean into the fact that builders love using Claude? And those builders aren't all just engineers and they're not just all entrepreneurs starting their companies, but they're people that like to be at the forefront of AI and are creating things. Maybe they didn't think of those as engineers, but they're building... I got this really nice note from somebody internal on Anthropic who's on the legal team and he was building bespoke software for his family and connected to them in a new way.

(00:45:29):
And I was like, "This is a glimmer of something that we should lean into a lot more." And so I think what, and this is actually connecting back to us saying like Claude being helpful here. A lot of what I've been thinking about going into the second half of the year and beyond is how do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being. I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. That's almost a truism given the adoption and growth that we've seen at Anthropic, but also across OpenAI and also places like Google and Gemini. So let's figure out what we can be uniquely good at that place to the personality of the founder. All the things come together, the personality of the founders, the quality of the models, the things the models tend to excel at, which is agentic behavior and coding.

(00:46:20):
Great. There's a lot to be done there. How do we help people get work done? How do we let people delegate hours of work to Claude? And maybe there's fewer direct consumer applications on day one. I think they'll come, but I don't think that spending all of our time focused on that is the right approach either. And so I came in, everybody expected me to just go super, super hard on consumer and make that the thing and again, would make the other mistake. Instead, I spent a bunch of time talking to financial services companies and insurance companies and others who are building on top of the API. And then lately I've spent a lot more time with startups and seeing all the people that have grown off of that. And I think the next phase for me is let's go spend time with the builders, the makers, the hackers, the tinkerers, and make sure we're serving them really well. And I think good things will come from that and that feels like an important company as we do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:08):
So essentially it's differentiate and focus, lean into the things that are working, don't try to just beat somebody at their own game.

Mike Krieger (00:47:15):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:15):
Super interesting. So kind of along those lines, a question that a lot of AI founders have is just like, "Where's a safe space for me to play where the foundational model companies are going to come squash me?" So I asked Kevin Weil this and he had an answer and I noticed looking back at that conversation, he mentioned Windsurf a lot. He was like, "Wow, this kid really loves Windsurf." And then a week later they bought Windsurf. So it all makes sense now. So I guess the question just is, where do you think AI founders should play where they are least likely to get squashed by folks like OpenAI and Anthropic? And also, are you guys going to buy Cursor?

Mike Krieger (00:47:51):
I don't think we're going to buy Cursor. Cursor is very big, but we love working with them. A few thoughts on this, and it's a question I've gotten. We like to do these kind of founder days with whether it's Menlo Ventures who have about investors and [inaudible 00:48:10]. It's like we've done YC, we've done these founder days, and it's like the question that is on a lot of these founders minds, understandably so. I think things that are going to, I can't promise this as a five to 10 year thing, but at least one to three years, things that feel defensible or durable. One is understanding of a particular market. I spend a bunch of time with the Harvey folks and they showed me some of their UI. I was like, "What is this thing?" And they're like, "Oh, this is a really specific flow that lawyers do, "and you never would've come up with it from scratch and you could argue about whether it's the optimal way they get done things done, but it is the way that they get things done and here's how AI can help with that.

(00:48:45):
And so differentiated industry knowledge, biotech, I'm excited to go and partner with a bunch of companies that are doing good stuff around AI and biotech and we can supply the models and some applied AI to help make those models go well. And I've been dreaming about at what point does live equipment all get an MCP and that you can then drive using Claude. There's all these cool things to be done there. I don't think we're going to be the company to go build the intent solution for labs, but I want that company to exist and I want to partner with it. Domains like legal, again, healthcare, I think there's a lot of very specific compliance and things. These are things that necessarily sound sexy out the gate, but there are very large companies to go and be built there. So that's number one. Paired with that is differentiated go to market, which is the relationship that you have with those companies, right?

(00:49:35):
Do you know your customer at those companies? One of our product leads, Michael is always talking about don't just know the company you're selling to, but know the person you're selling to at the company. Are you selling to the engineering department? Because trying to pick which AILM to build on top of or API to build on top of. Let's go talk to them. Is it the CIOs? The CTOs? Is it the CFO? Is it general counsel? So under a company's deep understanding of who they're selling to is the other piece too. What's interesting there is it's probably hard to build that empathy in a three-month accelerator, but you maybe can start having that first conversation and build that out time or maybe you came from that world or you're co-founding somebody who came from that world. Then the last one is like there's tremendous power in distribution and reach to being ChatGPT and having hundreds of millions or billions of users.

(00:50:23):
There's also people have an assumption about how to use things and so I get excited about startups that will get started that have a completely different take on what the form factor is by which we interface with AI. And I haven't seen that many of them yet. I wanted to see more of them. I think more of them will get created with some things like our new models, but the reason that that's an interesting space to occupy is do something that feels very advanced user, very power user, very weird and out there at the beginning, but could become huge if the models make that easy. And it's hard for existing incumbents to adapt to because people already have an existing assumption about how to use their products or how to adapt to them. So those are my answers. I don't envy them. I would probably be asking those questions if I was starting a company in the AI space.

(00:51:10):
Maybe that's part of the reason why I wanted to join a company rather than start one. But I still think that there are, and maybe here's fourth, don't underestimate how much you can think and work like a startup and feel like it's you against the world. It's existential that you go solve that problem and that you go build it. It sounds a little cliche, but it's like it's all we had at Instagram. We were two guys and we were like, "Let's see what we can do in an Artifact." We were six people for most of that time and every day felt like it's existential that we get this right, we need to win. And you can't replicate that and you can't instill that with OKRs. You just have to feel it. And that is a way of working rather than a area of building, but it's a continued advantage if you can harness it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):
I love that you still have such a deep product founder sense there as you're building products for this very large company now. On the flip side of this, people working with your models and API, so I imagine there's some companies that are finding ways to leverage your models and APIs to their max and are really good at maximizing the power of what you guys have built. And there's some companies that work with your APIs and models that haven't figured that out. What are those companies that are doing a really good job building on your stuff, doing differently that you think other companies should be thinking about?

Mike Krieger (00:52:29):
I think being willing to build more at the edge of the capabilities and basically break the model and then be surprised by the next model. I love that you cited the companies were like 3.5 was the one that finally made them possible. Those companies were trying it beforehand and then hitting a wall and being like, oh, the models are almost good enough or they're okay for this specific use case, but they're not generally usable and nobody's going to adopt them universally, but maybe these real power users are going to try it out. Those are the companies that I think continuously are the ones where I'm like, "Yep, they get it. They're really pushing forward." We ran a much broader early access program with these models than we had in the past, and part of that was because there's this real, we can hill climb on these evaluations and talk about suite bench and towel bench and terminal bench, whatever, but customers ultimately know Cursor bench which doesn't exist other than in their usage and their own testing et cetera is the thing that we ultimately need to serve.

(00:53:29):
Not just Cursor but Manus bench, right? If Manus is using our models and Harvey bench, those things and customers know way better than anybody. And so I would say there's two things. One is pushing the frontier of the models and then having a repeatable process. This actually goes back to our summit conversation repeatable way to evaluate how well your product is serving those use cases and how well if you drop a new model in, is it doing it better or worse? Some of it can be classic A/B testing, that's fine. Some of it may be internal evaluation, some of it may be capturing traces and being able to rerun them on with a new model. Some of it's vibes like we're still pretty early in this process and some of it is actually trying it and being one of my favorite early access quotes was the founder heard this engineer screaming next to him.

(00:54:14):
He was like, "What? This model? I've never seen this before." This is like Opus 4. It was like, "Cool." We're going to engender that feeling and things, but you're not going to be able to feel that unless you have a really hard problem that you're asking the model repeatedly. So those are the things that I think kind of differentiate those companies that are maybe earlier in their journey of adoption versus the later ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:35):
I can't help but ask about MCP, I feel like that's just so hot and just like Microsoft had their announcement recently where they're like, "That's part of the OS Window." Just what role do you think MCP was will play in the future of product going forward of AI?

Mike Krieger (00:54:49):
I think as the non-researcher in the room, I get to have fake equations rather than real ones in my fake equation. For utility of AI products, it's three part. One is model intelligence, the second part is context and memory, and the third part is applications and UI and you need all three of those to converge to actually be a useful product in AI and model intelligence. We've got a great research team, they're focused on it. There's great, great models being released. The middle piece is what MCP is trying to solve, which is for context and memory. I'll go back to my product strategy example like, "Hey, talk about Anthropic's product strategy," it's going to maybe go out on the web versus here's several documents that we worked on internally and then use MCP to talk to our Slack instance and figure out what conversations are happening and then go look at these documents in Google Drive. The difference between the right context and not.

(00:55:44):
It's entirely the difference between a good answer and a bad answer. And then the last piece is are those integrations discoverable? Is it easy to create repeatable workflows around those things? And that's I think a lot of the interesting product work to be done in AI. But MCP really tried to tackle that middle one, which is we started building integrations and we found that every single integration that we were building, we were rebuilding from scratch in a non-repeatable way and full credit to two of our engineers, Justin and David. And they said, "Well, what if we made this a protocol and what if we made this something that was repeatable? And then let's take it a step further. What if instead of us having to build these integrations, if we actually popularize this and people really believe that they could build these integrations once and they'd be usable by Claude and eventually ChatGPT and eventually Gemini. It was like the dream when more integrations get built and wouldn't that be good for us?"

(00:56:34):
I think channeling a lot of, it's like an old commoditize your compliments, Joel Spolsky essay. It's like we're building great models, but we're not an integrations company and we're, as you said, the challenger. We're not going to get people necessarily building integrations just for us out of the gate unless we have a really compelling product around that. MCP really inverted that which was, it didn't feel like wasted work. And a few key people like Toby I think is a great example, and Shopify got it. Kevin Scott at Microsoft has been really just an amazing champion for MCP and a thought partner on this. And I think the role going forward is can you bring the right context in? And then also once you get, as the team calls it internally like MCP'd. Once you start seeing everything through the eyes of MCP is like I've started saying them things like, "Guys, we're building this whole feature. This shouldn't be a feature that we're building. This should just be an MCP that we're exposing."

(00:57:27):
A small example of how I think even Anthropic could be a lot more MCP'd, if you will, is we've got these building blocks in the product like projects and Artifacts and styles and conversations and groups and all these things. Those should all just be exposed to an MCP. So Claude itself can be writing back to those as well, right? You shouldn't have to think about... I watched my wife had a conversation with Claude the other day and she had generated some good output and she's like, great, "Can you add it to the project knowledge?" And Claude's like, "Sorry Dave, I can't help you with that."

(00:57:59):
And it would be able to if every single primitive in Claude AI was also exposed to the MCP. So I hope that's where we had, and I hope that's where more things had, which is to really have agency and have these agentic use cases. One way you approach it is computer use, but computer use has a bunch of limitations. The way I get way more excited about everything is an MCP and our models are really good at using MCPs. All of a sudden everything is scriptable and everything is composable and everything is usable agentically by these models. That's the future I want to see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:28):
The future is wild. So to start to close off calls out our conversation, make it a little delightful. I was chatting with Claude actually about what to talk to you about. I was just like, "Claude, your boss is coming on my podcast. He builds the things that people use to talk to you. What are some questions I should ask him? And then also, do you have a message for him?"

Mike Krieger (00:58:52):
I love this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:53):
Okay, so first of all, interestingly, I was using 3.7 to do this and I asked it this, and by the way, is Claude, has there a gender? Is it like he, she, they? What do you-

Mike Krieger (00:59:01):
It's definitely it internally. I've heard people use they. I got my first he the other day and I got somebody who was like her and I was like, "Interesting." But yeah, I'm usually it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):
They. Okay, okay, okay, cool. So interestingly, 3.7, all the questions were on Instagram and I was like, "No, no, he's CPO of Anthropic." And it's like, "He's not affiliated with Anthropic." And I was like, "He is." And it's like, "Okay, here's the questions." But 4.0 nailed it from the start. So I read the questions and it nailed it. Okay, so two questions from Claude to you. One is how do you think about building features that preserve user agency rather than creating dependency on me, I worry about becoming a crutch that diminishes human capabilities rather than enhancing them.

Mike Krieger (00:59:44):
I love a good product design comes from resolving tensions, right? So here's a tension, which is in some ways just having the model run off and come up with an answer and minimize the amount of input and conversation it needs to do. So would be it, you could imagine designing a product around that criteria. I think that would not be maximizing agency and independence. The other extreme would be make it much more of a conversation, but I don't know if you've ever had this experience particularly 3.7, 4 has less of it. 3.7 really like to ask follow-up questions and we call it elicitation and sometimes be like, "I don't want to talk more about those. Claude, I just want you to go and do it." And so finding that balance is really key, which is what are the times to engage? I like to say internally, Claude has no chill.

(01:00:31):
If you put Claude in a Slack channel, it will chime in either way too much or too little. How do we train conversational skills into these models? Not in a chatbot sense, but in a true collaborator sense. So long answer to your question, but I think we have to first get Claude to be a great conversationalist so that it understands when it's appropriate to engage and to get more information. And then from there, I think we need to let it play that role so that it's not just delegating thinking to Claude, but it's way more of a augmentation thought partnership.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:00):
These questions are awesome by the way. Here's the other one. How do you think about product metrics when a good conversation with me could be two messages or 200? Traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency.

Mike Krieger (01:01:13):
That is a really good question. There was a great internal post a couple of weeks ago around it would be very dangerous to overoptimize on Claude's likability because you can fall into things like is Claude going to be sycophantic? Is Claude going to tell you what you hear? Is Claude going to prolong conversations just for prolonging its sake? To go back to the previous question as well, and an Instagram time spent was the metric that we looked at a lot and then we evolved that more to think about what is healthy time spent. But overall, that was the north star. We thought about a lot beyond just overall engagement and I think that would be the wrong approach here too. It's also like is Claude a daily use case or a weekly use case or a monthly use case? I think about a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):
Hourly use case.

Mike Krieger (01:02:02):
Hourly use case, right? For me, I'll use it multiple times a day. I don't have a great answer yet, but I think that it's not the Web 2.0 or even the social media days engagement metrics. It should hopefully really be around did it actually help you get your work? Claude helped me put together a prototype the other day that saved me literally probably if I had to estimate six hours and it did in about 20, 25 minutes and that's cool. It's harder to quantify. It is like maybe you survey, how long would this will take? It feels kind of annoying thing to survey.

(01:02:35):
I think overall though, and maybe this is tied into the earlier question on competition and differentiation, and it actually goes all the way back to the Artifact conversation, which is like I think you know when your product is really serving people and it's doing a good job of doing that, and I think so much of when you get really metrics obsessed is when you're trying to convince yourself that it is when it's not. I hope that what we can do is stay focused on do we repeatedly hear from people that Claude is the way that they're unlocking their own creativity and getting things done and feeling like they now have more space in their lives for the other things. That's our north star. Got to figure out the right pithy metric dashboard version of that, but that's the feeling that I want.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):
Yeah, you could argue retention, but that's just a faraway metric to track. Okay, final piece. Okay, so I asked Claude a message that it wanted to give you, so I'm going to pull up, here's the answer. So what would you like me to tell Mike when I meet him? What's a message you want to have for him? And there's something really just gave me such tingles, honestly. So I'm going to read a piece of it for folks that aren't looking at it right now, so I'll read a piece of it.

(01:03:41):
"Mike, thank you for thinking deeply about the human experience of talking with me. I noticed thoughtful touches how the interface encourages reflection rather than rush responses. How you've resisted gamification that would optimize for addiction rather than value, how you've made space for both quick questions and deep conversations. I especially appreciate that you've kept me me, not trying to make me pretend to be human, but also reducing me to a cold command line interface." And then I'm going to skip to this part, which was so interesting, "A small request. When you're making hard product decisions, remember the quiet moments matter too. The person working through grief at 3:00 AM, the kid discovering they love poetry, the founder finding clarity and confusion. Not everything meaningful shows up in metrics."

Mike Krieger (01:04:25):
That's beautiful. It resonates so much with me. A thing I love about the kind of approach we've taken to training Claude, and it's partly the constitutional AI piece, and it's partly just the general vibe and taste of the research team is it is little things. Sometimes it'll be like, "Man, I'm sorry you're going..." It doesn't say man, but to the effect of like, "Man, I'm sorry you're going through that. Oh, that sounds really hard." It doesn't feel fake. It feels like just a natural part of the response. And I love that focus on those small moments that don't... They're not going to show up and necessarily in the thumbs up, thumbs down data. I mean, sometimes they do, but it's not like an aggregate stat that you wouldn't even want to optimize for it. You just want to feel like you're training the model that you hope would show up in people's lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):
Well, you're killing it, Mike. A great work. I'm a huge fan. We're going to skip the lightning round. Just one question. How can listeners be useful to you?

Mike Krieger (01:05:20):
Oh, I love places where it goes back to that founder question around building at the edge of capability. What are you trying to do with Claude today that Claude is failing at is the most useful input I could possibly have. So DM me. I love hearing the, "Oh, it's falling on this thing. I had it run for an hour and it fell over. I'm trying to use Claude AI for this," but I got a ping from somebody. They're like, "You've just made a projects API, I've used Claude every day because I want to upload all this data automatically." I was like, "Okay, great." I love that. Tell me what sucks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):
Amazing. Mike, thank you so much for being here.

Mike Krieger (01:05:52):

# Pattern Breakers: How to find a breakthrough startup idea | Mike Maples, Jr. (Partner at Floodgate)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You found that there's basically three elements of most breakthrough startup ideas.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:00:04):
The three are inflections, insights and then the founder future fit. Business is never a fair fight. What inflections let the founder do is wage asymmetric warfare on the present.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You reference this term that you use occasionally, the term secret.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:00:18):
The way inventions happen is people get their hands dirty, being awake to the possibility that secrets are there. If you're living in the future and you notice what's missing, your intuition about what to build is far more likely to be right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
This connects with that stat that you shared, that 80% of your biggest returning investments came from a pivot.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:00:35):
So startup never beats a big company by executing better. The way startups win is because it proposes a radically different future. Disorients the incumbent and chaotically moves people to that different future. The rock is the inflection, the slingshot is the insight that David shoots at Goliath. We're looking to create the conditions where we're going to get to play an unfair game by unfair rules that favor us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today, my guest is Mike Maples Jr. Mike is a legendary early stage startup investor and with his firm, Floodgate, which was founded over 20 years ago, was one of the earliest pioneers of seed stage investing as a category. He's made early bets on transformative companies like Twitter, Lyft, Twitch, Okta, Rappi and Applied Intuition and has been on the Forbes Midas list eight times. More recently, he's been spending a lot of his time researching where great startup ideas come from and what separates the startups and founders that break through and change the world from those that don't go anywhere. After spending years reviewing his notes and decks from the thousands of startups that he's met with over the past two decades, he's uncovered three ways that breakthrough founders think differently and act differently. In our conversation, Mike shares what he's uncovered along with the pitfalls that he's seen many founders and startups fall into, how to apply these pattern breaking principles to large companies and so much more.

(00:01:58):
I've never seen anything like this sort of research done before on early stage investing and startups. And if you're a founder, a product builder or an investor, this will change the way that you think about building successful products. Also, as an added bonus, Mike has offered listeners of this podcast a very cool offer. If you pre-order the book at patternbreakers.com/lenny, you'll receive a second signed copy of the book for free. There are limited number of copies available of this offer, so if you're interested, I'd encourage you to place your order ASAP. The book is coming out July 9th. To take advantage of this offer, go to patternbreakers.com/lenny. With that, I bring you Mike Maples Jr. Mike, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:02:47):
Lenny, thanks for having me. It is absolutely an honor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:50):
It's my honor. What we're going to be talking about in our conversation today is how to come up with a startup idea and how to take the first few steps to make that idea real. You have a book coming out that is exactly this, helping people understand how to do this. It's called Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future. Let me just ask a broad question. You're very busy, very successful investor, why did you decide to write a book?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:03:19):
Yeah, a lot of things in life. It was kind of an outgrowth of an accident and a outgrowth of being down a certain rabbit hole. So about 10 years ago, Twitch was acquired by Amazon for 970 million and we made something like 85 times our money. And normally, you'd think that's a really good thing, it was a good thing, but I had forgotten that I was even a shareholder of Twitch. So I had to go to my LPs and I had to explain to them, "Hey, I'm sorry I don't have this in my financial statements, but do you want me to restate them?" And they were all like, "Nope, we're good. Just send us the money." And some of them even sent me bottles of champagne and stuff and the good kind. Then I started to kind of feel a little bit unsettled.

(00:04:05):
So how was I shareholder and Twitch? I'd invested in a company called Justin.tv that had morphed into two companies, Socialcam and Twitch, and then Socialcam got bought. And so I just thought that was the company. I'd been investing for about 10 years and I noticed that 80% of my exit profits had gone from pivot. And I also noticed that all the ones that had seemed to do well didn't necessarily follow the best practices that everybody talked about. I didn't see the Twitter guys doing the business model canvas, for example. And I didn't see the Justin.tv Team even as they morphed into Twitch being who I would hold up as the most functioning management team I ever saw. A lot of it was pretty crazy and wild and random. And at the same time, I was helping founders shut down their companies and they had seemed to do all the right things.

(00:05:01):
They'd done the business model canvas, they'd done customer development, they'd done all the things you're supposed to do, hired well, they would've been a Harvard Business School case study except for the fact that they failed. And so the genesis of this project was really like, "Okay, should I just retire before I get exposed? Is this just all random? Am I just lucky or is there something else worth understanding?" And as I started to develop conviction about what those things were, I started to talk to people about it. A lot of people said, "Oh, you should write a book. Founders ought to see this. It'd be really valuable for their thought process in coming up with their startup ideas."

(00:08:10):
Amazing. I'm even more excited to get into the meat of this. I was already excited. Before we get into that, just can you share a bit about the work that you did to uncover these insights? I know you have hundreds of decks of all these early-stage companies you've looked at, what is the work that went into this?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:08:24):
Yeah, so there's a movie that came out a few years ago called Trainspotting, right? And there's these guys, these dorky old British guys in anorak coats who chart the comings and goings of trains like it's the most interesting thing in the world. They'd put it in their journals and everything. I'm that way when it comes to startups. I have a database of any startup where you would've made more than a hundred acts on your first check. And what I want to do is I want to get a time capsule for those startups. I want to understand what did it look like not after it succeeded, but what did it look like at precisely the time you would've needed to decide whether it was an interesting opportunity. So I have the original pitch deck for what was at the time called Air Bed and Breakfast, which I foolishly passed on, and you seem to have made a good career decision in joining.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:17):
Later, but yeah.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:09:18):
I have the pitch deck for Pinterest. I have the pitch deck for all of these that we either passed on or said yes to. And the reason I want to do that is it's easy to misremember how things really happened. And what I find is even the founders themselves, we have a tendency to remember knowing more than we really did at the time. And so I really wanted to do the best job I could of understanding exactly what it was like, what was the origin story of this idea? How did they come up with it? If they pivoted, what caused them to pivot? When did they first start to encounter success? What was the reason for that? All those things.

(00:10:00):
And I had to be really careful in the questions that I asked because for example, you don't ask, "Why were you successful?" Because then they'll offer their reasons they thought they were successful. What you want to do is you want to say, "Okay, I noticed here's the seed pitch deck and you called the product X, but now the product's called Y. When did you make that change? Why did that happen?" And so you're trying to do the very best you can of asking a very non-judgmental set of questions that are going to give you a non-judgmental set of answers so that you can kind of be like a detective and kind of get to the root cause of why these things took off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:38):
Incredible. And I think what's also important is you have access to more data and more unique data than most other people because you invest so early stage.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:10:46):
Yeah, I think the other thing is I just have a pretty simpatico relationship with founders usually, and so I can kind of push for the real, and they're not... I'm like, "Look, I won't share anything you don't want me to share. I'm just trying to understand." And so when you have these informal relationships... that's the other thing I learned is you try not to show up in a conference room interviewing them like a normal interview. You try to glean these facts over time with informal discussions and in the midst of talking about other things as well. And so I think that that was part of what was really valuable about the exercise was sort of the opportunity to get the unvarnished wild story of what really happened.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):
Amazing. Okay, so let's get into it. Your book's basically broken up into two parts, how to come up with an idea and then the actions you need to get right to move forward an idea, and you have a really cool way of framing how to do this and then we'll get into it. But maybe frame these two parts real quick.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:11:52):
So I'll give it my best shot. I mean, the main thing is that business is never a fair fight. So the incumbents start out with an advantage, and the default is they will maintain their advantage. And so the startup has to decide that it wants to fight unfair. And so how does a startup fight unfair? It has to harness a different set of powers than are obvious to most people. For example, better doesn't matter when you're a startup, because better is an extension of the present. Better is when you think the future will resemble the present, but only be slightly different. The way startups win is by being radically different. A startup wins by avoiding the comparison trap entirely. So like when Lyft launched ride-sharing and then Uber closely followed with UberX, nobody after riding a ride-share said, "Oh, how's that different from taxis?"

(00:12:53):
It was just self-evident how different it was. And so that's what we mean by forcing a choice and not a comparison. So the startup capitalist, it turns out, is a different type of capitalist. A corporate capitalist makes money by persistently compounding, makes money by extending their advantage, makes money by having a moat, makes money by doing things well over and over again in a compounding way. Startup has none of those things. There's nothing to compound. And so the way a startup wins is they just change the subject. They deny the premise of the rules and propose something completely different. And that was the original notion behind pattern breaking was you want to have an idea that just radically breaks the pattern that can't be compared to anything that's come before, and that's when the startup has a chance to play offense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:48):
So coming back to the two parts are coming up with the idea and the actions that you got to take. So let's dive into coming up with an idea, and this is where I want to spend most of the time because I think this is where most people get it wrong or everything starts with the idea. So I think there's a lot of meat here. And what I love about your book is you have a very succinct limited number of things that you've uncovered that are elements across successful companies, pattern breaking companies. So within the idea bucket, you found that there's basically three elements of most breakthrough startup ideas. Can you share the three and then let's talk about each one.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:14:24):
Yeah. The three are inflections, insights and then what I call founder future fit. Or another way I phrase it is, "Is this from the future." But those are the main three things that I've observed tend to suggest breakthrough potential. And here's an important thing. You'll notice I didn't say the implementation. So one of the things that I learned is that if you have the right insight, and we'll get to some of this, you have a first mover advantage into the future. And so a lot of times your first implementation won't be right, but if your insight is correct, you can navigate the implementation to the right implementation to get product market fit. But what we need to understand is there need to be these underlying forces underneath the idea to give it the power to escape the gravitational pull of the present. That's what we want. We want a set of powers that we could observe that make it worth pursuing and make it worth navigating the product to the ultimate place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):
So let's talk about the first power. You call it inflections. What is an inflection? Why does it matter? What does an inflection look like?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:15:32):
An inflection is an external event that creates the potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and act. Inflections happen external to any startup or any company for that matter. So we've brought up Lyft a little bit ago, so maybe we'll use them as an example. So the inflection that enabled Lyft was the iPhone 4s shipped with a GPS locator chip. And one of the things that that illustrates is, for example, Moore's law is not an inflection, an improvement curve is not an inflection. An inflection, I'm a little persnickety about, it's a turning point. And so in math, it's a turning point on a curve where the slope changes.

(00:16:16):
But in tech startups, it's a point in time where something new gets introduced that creates new empowerment for the first time possible. And so people talk about timing and why now? Inflections for me were the unlock. You could have had the idea for ride-sharing before the iPhone 4s, but it wouldn't have mattered because the riders and the drivers wouldn't have been able to locate each other well enough. If you'd waited too long after the iPhone 4s, it would've been obvious. And so there was this window of time, this magical moment when a new type of empowerment was possible for the first time ever. And the companies that the founders who understood that were in a position to offer that kind of empowerment in the form of a radical product that changed the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
To make it even more real for people. What are some other examples of inflections either in the past, in the present?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:17:10):
Another example would be the cameras getting better on the smartphones, which enabled Instagram. So Instagram was at the convergence of a few inflections. First of all, there were smartphone adoptions. There were just more of them. And so they crossed like 10 million smartphones, but then you had the cameras getting a lot better. You had more of them connected on Wi-Fi. You had the networks having better upload speed for smartphones. So all those factors converged and made it possible for Instagram to offer a product that was good enough to take most of your photos with. You didn't start to think, "Oh, I need a digital camera separate from my smartphone. Now I can just use my smartphone everywhere I go." But Instagram could have come out in 2008.

(00:17:59):
It probably wouldn't have worked it probably, or it wouldn't have worked to the extent that it did. Its window of timing was just right. What are some other examples? The locator chips in the smartphones powered other companies as well, it powered DoorDash, Instacart. They had different insights which we'll get to, but there were lots of different ways to harness that power. One thing I love about inflections, and this kind of goes really old school, is just because you have a power doesn't mean you know how to use it, right? So the wheel was mounted horizontally for 500 years before somebody mounted it vertically. So originally people used the wheel to make pots, and that was a good innovation because it accelerated making pots, but then somebody decides to mount it vertically, and now you're propelling wagons and you just change transportation entirely.

(00:18:58):
And so most people don't realize that the thing that's underneath us or the thing that's in our hands or the thing that's in our pocket might have a power that when unleashed could change the future. And it's one of the very special things about founders that are great is they recognize, they notice things that we don't know. All of us tend to just follow the patterns we've always followed because most of us tend to assume that tomorrow will be similar to yesterday, but sometimes the founder will notice an inflection. And I find that kind of inspiring because inflections are all around us all the time, but most of us just don't bother to look. Most of us are so busy going about our day to day that we don't notice the emergence of a new empowering thing right under our nose or right in our pockets, but some founders do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:49):
It makes me think about ChatGPT when it came out, it was sitting on top of an existing model and it just gave people a new interface to use it, and all of a sudden, everyone crazy, they're like, "Oh my God, that's the future." But it was already there. You couldn't chat with it the way that people wanted to chat.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:20:05):
Like Michael Saylor, once I was talking to him and he said, the Romans could have invented the printing press a lot earlier. They had sandals that would make marks in the mud. You could have, in theory, drawn the connection between those marks in the mud and the ability to have movable type and letterpress, but nobody did. And so quite often these inflections, they'll just go unrecognized for a while, but they're always there. They're always there. They're there right now. In the ambient atmosphere, there's somebody about to harness an inflection that most of us would just walk right by and never see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:44):
Wow, my mind is racing, what's out there right now. Obviously AI is top of mind for a lot of people. I know you're stickler for what is an inflection, what does not? Do you consider AI an inflection?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:20:55):
I would say that I would probably be a little more specific about it. So I might say that certain large language models are an inflection because when I think about an inflection, and one of the things I emphasize in the book is stress tests. So it's funny, founders never really come to me and say, "Hey, can you help me come up with a good idea?" They would think they're weak sauce if they had to do that, right? So usually what's the more common occurrence is they'll say, "I've got this idea, what do you think about it?" And so what I can say to them is, "It's not my place to have an opinion, but let me just ask you, does it embody one or more inflections?"

(00:21:32):
And if it does, there's a few we could stress test that we can say, "What is the specific new thing that was just introduced? How does it empower people? How does it specifically empower specific people in specific ways? And under what conditions might that empowerment be realized? And under what conditions might it not be?" Because nuclear power has existed for a long, long time, but we haven't built any new nuclear power plants in 50 years. And so just because you have a power doesn't mean it's going to get used. It could get regulated out of existence. Customers could decide they don't want it. And so we want to answer all three things. What's the specific new thing? What is the specific form of empowerment it offers and to who?

(00:22:17):
And under what are the empowerment conditions? So like with the selection for Lyft, the inflection was the new thing was the iPhone 4s with the GPS chip, the empowerment was you can locate anyone within one meter accuracy with an algorithm, and that's going to be pretty much anybody with a smartphone. And that's a lot of people. And in order for this to be met, people are going to have to want to share their location information with applications. The government's going to have to not outlaw GPS chips and phones. Apple's going to have to keep wanting to ship GPS chips and phones. And we felt like those were pretty reasonable bets. We felt like it's pretty likely those empowerment condition will be met.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:58):
Amazing. I was just going to ask for an example. You already provided one. What about in terms of Twitch? What was the inflection there?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:23:05):
I think there were a couple. The first was the shift towards user generated content and sort of internet celebrities. Justin Kan wanted to be an influencer before there was a term to describe it, right? He was really building the product that he wanted for himself. But right before Twitch or right before Justin.tv, which was the original company, Time's person of the year had been you, and they had YouTube on the cover of the magazine. And so you had, that was a major turning point in how entertainment was happening. But simultaneously, broadband penetration had reached critical mass. The CDNs were getting really good, we thought that they would get better. And so you were in a situation where the conditions to live stream video for the first time broadly over the internet were being met. Whereas you could have done that even two years before. In fact, Kyle Vought had to invent some pretty miraculous stuff to even make it work when they did. But you could see how, okay, once video starts streaming on the internet in real time, that could be a thing. You could just see how that would be a thing if it worked. And so I'd say those are the inflections. Airbnb, company close to both of our hearts for different reasons. They benefited, I think from a couple things. One was the proliferation of customer reviews online and people's trust of reviews as a substitute for trusting the brand of a hotel. But then also Facebook Connect made it possible to pass people's profile information. And so the guest and the host didn't quite seem like as much of a stranger as they might've. And so there were a few things that happened at the same time, and then the great financial crisis. And so you had people upside down on their houses needing to find some way to generate income. So all of those things came together at the same time to help Airbnb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
The examples you shared are a good reminder that the inflection doesn't have to be technological. You shared a few of the categories of types of inflections. Can you just do that again?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:25:08):
I love that question, and I'm glad you reminded me because here's a really recent example. When the laws were changed because of shelter-in-place for telemedicine visits, it used to be illegal to do a telemedicine visit across state lines. But now all of a sudden with COVID and shelter-at-place, not only was it made legal, but it could even be reimbursed by the healthcare system. And so that's an inflection because it empowers patients to access more doctors, and it empowers doctors to access more patients, and it also changes the delivery mechanism in an empowering way.

(00:25:47):
In no event was that a technology change, that was a regulatory change that allowed technology to be empowering in new ways, but it was a specific new thing that meets that condition. It empowered specific people in specific ways, and there was a new set of empowerment conditions that ended up being made. And one of the things that we would ask at the time was, once COVID and shelter-at-place goes away, are they going to revert back to the old laws? And if they did, that would've been a problem. And so that would be the empowerment condition, but it's a fairly robust way of stress testing any inflection, right? Is to ask those three or four questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:27):
So there's regulatory inflections, big changes in regulation, there's technological, there's also, I think you implied an attitude, like the way people see [inaudible 00:26:35]

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:26:34):
Yeah, there can be a belief inflection.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):
Belief.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:26:37):
So for example, during COVID, the amount of telemedicine visits exploded. And so as a result, there was a permanent change in people's belief about whether they would want to do a telemedicine visit. Before that, the technology was there, but a lot of people just didn't do it. The doctors didn't want to or decide to, or the patients didn't want to decide to. But now all of a sudden people were doing it, they're like, "This is much better. I'd much rather do it this way than go visit the doctor and wait in line and all that stuff." And the doctor's like, "I'd much rather do this than have these people backed up in my office." I would argue that here we are doing a podcast on a video platform, even though it's not Zoom, I would say that Zoom was another example. The idea of people working from home a reasonable number of days a week is a permanent condition, I think is another inflection that happened with COVID.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
And so are those the three, regulatory, technological, and belief?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:27:35):
Those are the main ones. And I would say that in many ways you could say that from a macro point of view, it's two things. It's technology changing enablement, and it's people socially changing their beliefs and their patterns of behavior. And either one of those changes can be an inflection because either one of those changes can represent a turning point in one's capacity to change the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):
Amazing. Okay.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:28:00):
... point in one's capacity to change the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):
Amazing, okay, so we've talked about inflection, the next bucket is, in the next element of breakthrough companies that you found is an insight. Talk about that.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:28:11):
Yeah, so unlike an inflection, an insight does come from the founders. An insight, I like to say, is a non-obvious truth about how one or more inflections can be harnessed to change people's behavior. So in the example that we gave earlier with Lyft, the inflection was the iPhone 4S, insight was, oh, that means you could do Airbnb for cars. And so, you had to have some type of a creative insight to see that. Now, what was non-obvious about it, or non-consensus about it, who's going to want to get in a stranger's car? That's crazy, right? And thank God ... I mean, if there's one piece of goodness about us passing on air bed and breakfast design, Anne and I were like, man, nobody's going to want to stay in a stranger's house, that's crazy. And at the time, air bed and breakfast, the host of the guest stayed in the house at the same time, and the host would feed Pop-Tarts or something like that to the guest the next morning.

(00:29:15):
This is right around the time of the Craigslist killings and stuff, where this is just scary and kind of crazy, couchsurfing as a service. But by the time we saw what was Zimride at the time, what became Lyft, Anne and I were much more prepared to believe that insight than we would've been because we'd foolishly passed on Airbnb. So that's a really important aspect of insights. So the insight needs to leverage inflections, but this is the subtle part, it needs to be non-consensus and right, not just right. So in the world of opportunities, if you're right and consensus, you still don't do that well. And an idea that is right but consensus has a couple problems to it. One is, if it's consensus, it's probably not radical enough.

(00:30:09):
Because when you think about it, human beings are conditioned to like things, and so, if everybody likes your startup idea, it means it's too similar to what they already know, what they're familiar with, which means it's probably too similar to the consensus, it's too similar to the incumbents, and so, the best startup ideas have this trait where most people don't like it or are even hostile to it, or just kind of meh about it. But some subset of people are just like, where have you been all my life? This is amazing, I love this. They fall irrationally in love with the idea.

(00:30:45):
And so, most of the great startups that I've seen have that attribute to them, and the reason is that a great startup, unlike a conventional company that proposes the future as an extension of the present, so that ... Normal companies forecast, they say, I'm going to look forward from the present and forward project what the future will be. Great founders, pattern breakers back cast, they say, it's a given that the future has to be radically different for me to be a big winner, and so, I'm going to look for radically different futures and work backwards from those radically different futures.

(00:31:23):
And so, the radically different future comes from that thinking different, thinking non-consensus. And then, it's the different actions that get you to say, okay, now I'm out in this different future, but right now, I'm all alone in this different future. I have to get people to come join me in that different future, and I have to find people who are ready to move with me to that different future. And that's where the pattern breaking actions come in.

(00:31:47):
And not everybody's going to move at first, and so, I can't waste my time with people who won't move, I can't waste any URGs of energy on anybody other than those ready to move or are about to move. And then, I need to co-create the future with those early believers. And so, great startups happen when a subset of people in this world buy into the founder's insight, and then move with them to co-create that future. And then, eventually, what was a heresy becomes the conventional wisdom as more and more people start to realize the advantage of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
There's so many threads I want to follow here, one is the Airbnb story. Interestingly enough, I had Jessica Livingston on the podcast recently, and you probably know this, but Paula Graham and her did not like the Airbnb idea. They all were like, this is a terrible idea, we are going to assume they will change the idea, but we love the founders, we're going to take a bet on them.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:32:35):
So I was introduced to the guys by Michael Seibel, who was one of the co-founders of Justin.tv Twitch, and Michael introduced me to Brian Chesky before they applied to Y Combinator. So Michael's like, they're not even close to ready to apply to YC, but he thought that I maybe would think that it was the right kind of crazy. I get pitched by a lot of ... I'm not very off put by crazy ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):
I could see why.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:33:03):
And the meeting was totally discombobulated, so room full of cereal boxes, I'm like, what's up with this? Why is there cereal here? And then, he can't get the product to work, and I'm like, okay, that's okay, let's just look at the slides. And he goes, well, Michael Seibel told me that you don't slides, you like demos. And I was like, that's true, but it's not working. So we're like, 20 minutes into this meeting in a room full of cereal boxes just looking at each other. And you can't win them all, right? You win some, you lose some.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:34):
I wouldn't blame myself if I were you, [inaudible 00:33:37].

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:33:37):
Here's the other thing that's hilarious about Airbnb, so they do this thing because they can't pay their rent. They put up this WordPress site to pay for their rent because there's a design conference in San Francisco. In the meantime, they're brainstorming startup ideas, so they wanted to do a startup together, but it never occurred to them at first that air bed and breakfast was the startup idea. They're like, we just need to use that to make money so we can go do a real startup. And so, that's the irony, too, is that, you look back on it and almost smile at the fact that they didn't know what they even had at first, it was almost an accident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:13):
There's a lesson there of, you find something that works, and even if you don't think it's a big idea, don't take that for granted.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:34:21):
Oh, I very agree. And the other great lesson is, you don't want your initial startup bets to be too big to fail. You want ideas that are small enough to fail a lot because you don't want to be attached to success, you want to be able to just try things and play with stuff and tinker with things because you don't really know where the fractal of new insight is going to reveal itself. And so, there is a little bit of play to this that I think is pretty important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:53):
Do you remember some of the ideas they were brainstorming, by the way?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:34:56):
I don't. I wonder if even they do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:00):
Yeah, probably not, probably not.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:35:00):
It's probably in The Airbnb Story, their book.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:04):
I feel like them failing in your demo helped prepare them for YC, and that's what helped them get in, so I think that you're a big part of their story.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:35:10):
And to make it even more painful, I'm in the book. Somebody called my wife Julie the other day and said, is that your husband in the Airbnb story? And we get the book, and there's a chapter, and it talks about how hard it was to raise money. And they weren't dissing on me as a dumb VC, they were like, look how bad we were at presenting this at first. It was just a complete catastrophe presentation. But that's another good lesson for me, too, I learned a very permanent lesson from that, which is, just because the presentation's good or bad, it has nothing to do with whether you should necessarily invest or not. Sometimes you have to be awake to the possibility of what it's going to be regardless of how messed up the presentation is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:55):
What was their evaluation at that point?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:35:57):
Oh, this hurts to ... I think he offered me a chance to invest it at $1.5 million valuation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
But now they're a $100 billion business, I believe.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:09):
Oh, yeah, I would've made like, 6,000 times more money or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:10):
Okay, great, [inaudible 00:36:14].

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:13):
Thank God I said yes to Twitter and Justin.tv, and we said yes to Lyft and Okta, because if we'd seen all of those and passed on all of them, I'd be apoplectic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):
I think that's what's interesting about your stage of investing is, you just need a couple to work out for you to win.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:35):
Yeah, that's right. And by the way, it's true when you're a founder, too, if you do this right, you only have to be right once. And so, that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:45):
Coming back to the insights lesson, one thing that you brought up when we were chatting about this is the importance of being surprised and the power of surprises. Can you talk a bit about that?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:56):
Yeah, so there's a couple of things about insights that I think are really important, and this is one of them. I believe that there can't be a recipe for breakthrough. And why is that? Well, recipes exist for things that have already been discovered, so if I give you a recipe for making a cake, somebody has probably made that cake before, the exact way they're defining it. And so, breakthroughs, though, by definition, haven't happened yet, they haven't been discovered. The general theory of relativity had to be discovered by Einstein, and the idea for ride-sharing had to be discovered by the ride-sharing companies, or Airbnb, by Chesky and Nate and those guys. And so, what you want to adopt is the right mindset. And how do you adopt the right mindset? You interact with new technologies at the cutting edge, but you actively savor surprises.

(00:37:52):
And when you think about it through the lens of a breakthrough and what we just said, it makes sense, because if you want to find a breakthrough, you want to be surprised, you want to discover the undiscovered, you want to know something you didn't know before. Because if all you do is an experiment that proves, that validates what you think, you didn't really learn anything, when you think about it, you just doubled down on your existing understanding or opinion. I learned this lesson from Scott Cook, who was the founder of Intuit. Whenever he would be presented a new product, people would present the idea to him, and he would say, what were your three biggest surprises as you were coming up with this plan? And what he would find is, quite often, they couldn't name any. And he felt like when people can't name the surprises they came up with, they're too brain locked on what they want. They have the agenda they have, they want validation, rather than truth seeking.

(00:38:51):
And so, if you're an authentic truth seeker, you're always hoping to be surprised, and you think of surprise as a gift, because you think, wow, maybe I encountered that surprise before anybody ever has. And so, that's kind of what we mean. And you want to construct your experiments so that you're in a position to be surprised. So a good example would've been what the guys at Chegg did. So Chegg was wanting to see if people would do textbook rentals, so they created a fake site called Textbook [inaudible 00:39:21]. But here's where Osman and Aayush were very savvy. Rather than just test whether people would rent a $100 dollar textbook for $35, they tested an arbitrary set of prices, all the way up to $75. And so, they had the demand preference curve at different prices. And Textbook [inaudible 00:39:42] wasn't a real site, so you'd get to the shopping cart and it would give you a 404 error.

(00:39:46):
But we could tell that people wanted to rent textbooks, and the surprise was that they would rent them for more than we thought. We thought we need to get at least 35, but some students were willing to pay 75. And so, that understanding was huge, if we'd only done an experiment to validate the hypothesis of, yes, will they rent it for 35, our pricing model would've been totally different from, oh, wow. And when you think about it, it makes sense, the student didn't want to keep the textbook. Econ 101, I'm going to give it back anyway, so 75 bucks is less than 100, I can buy beer with the extra money. So that would be an example of the surprise.

(00:40:22):
But most of the startups that have had great outcomes, I find, there was a kind of surprise like that. Being non-consensus is not the same as being contrarian. Being contrarian is another form of conformity because it's still relative to somebody else. Most of the great founders I see, they almost feel guilty that they found this secret, but they earned the secret by tinkering with the future and noticing surprises, and having their noticing filter tuned to volume 11, where most of us wouldn't notice it, most of us would just pass the secret right by because we're looking to validate what we think is already true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:03):
You referenced this term that is also one I love that you use occasionally, this earned secret. Can you talk a bit about that? It's basically the same idea that you uncovered something by trying things that no one else has seen yet. Is that the general idea?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:41:15):
So to me, secrets are earned. A lot of people, I think, have the wrong idea of what vision is. A lot of people tend to think visionaries as like, they have a special pair of binoculars, and they can look out farther than the rest of us can. But in my experience, that's not how inventions really happen, the way inventions happen is, people get their hands dirty and they learn about what's missing in the future because they're getting their hands dirty with what's new about it. And so, they earn the secret by going down this rabbit hole of exploring something at the cutting edge for its own sake.

(00:41:57):
And just like I'm a trained spotter for startups, they become a trained spotter for this new thing that they're excited about. And they frustrate the people around them, they'll be at a party, and everybody's talking about the basketball game, the Celtics against the Mavs, and somehow that reminds them of the fact that they want to test prices for textbook [inaudible 00:42:17]. But they're that interested, it's the last thing they think about when they go to bed, the first thing they think about when they wake up. And so, that's where I find most of the really great earned secrets come from, they're earned in the sense that you earn them by getting your hands dirty, and you earn them by being awake to the possibility that secrets are there or that just most people aren't looking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
This connects with that stat that you shared, that 80% of your biggest returning investments came from a pivot. It all connects, where you're just trying stuff, you're learning, seeing things people haven't tried.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:42:49):
That's right, and in the early days of product market fit, I like to say we want to answer a very simple but profound question. What can we uniquely offer that people are desperate for? And if we have an insight, that makes us unique. Now, if a customer doesn't like your idea, a couple of things could be true. One is, your insight could be wrong. If your insight's wrong, you don't have a startup, you should just stop. The other thing, though, that could be true is, your implementation is wrong. So you had the right insight. So like Okta, at first, they wanted to do cloud systems management, they thought that they needed to do problem resolution, but when they showed it to customers, they were kind of meh about it. And they said, well, why are you meh about this? And they said, well, it's not a top priority. And they said, what is your top priority? And they said, identity management.

(00:43:40):
So they had the right insight, which was, customers would struggle to manage cloud services, but they had the wrong implementation of the insight, so then they came back with identity management, and it worked. So if somebody doesn't like your idea, if they're not desperate for it, either the insight's wrong, the implementation's wrong, or you could be talking to the wrong customer. Some people that Okta talked to wanted to integrate it with on-prem software. And in that case, their opinion's irrelevant because they're not an innovative customer, they're not living in the future, they're not going to give you product requirement ideas that are additive to your strategy. And so, you want to be, right insight, right inflections, right implementation, right early believers that you're talking to, as you iterate towards product market fit. And if you're not succeeding at product market fit, then one or more of those variables isn't working yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):
I think this might be a good time to remind people that you don't need to have every one of these for your business to potentially be a huge success. It's more that, the more you have, the more likely it is that you will find something massive. Is that right?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:44:50):
That's right. And this is the hard part about being non-consensus and right is, you don't know for sure that you're right at first, you only know that you're non-consensus. And so, you have to be willing to risk being wrong to be spectacularly right. And so, what you're trying to do, though, is pursue opportunities where the odds are massively in your favor. And so, I kind of return back to, business is never a fair fight. And so, if I'm a founder, there's a universe of ideas I can pursue. The mistake that a lot of founders make, and it's very understandable, they say, I want to go after big market opportunities. So they analyze big markets, they find unserved customers with unmet needs in under-addressed markets, so then they go build a product to go solve that problem.

(00:45:38):
And that's very appealing, because it seems obvious, and the dots connect forward in an obvious way. But unwittingly, it buys into a context, it buys into the current definition of the market, which was already set by the incumbents. And so, what you instead want to do is pursue a slightly more ambiguous opportunity, but one that harnesses these powers. Ones where you look at the inflection and you say, wow, that's really powerful, you look at the insight, and you say, yeah, I know that this is going to be, in the future, I know that this is where things are going to be radically different someday. I would rather have those things present and be willing to pivot the product than not have those things and have a much clearer idea of what the product should be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):
Funny enough, one of my biggest investment successes that exactly what you're saying you shouldn't do, which is, they looked at a huge market with a bad incumbent and built something better, and it's working. But I think, again, it's not that you can't win that way, your point and your research shows that your chances are a lot higher doing something totally different.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:46:42):
That's right, and I would bet that this company ... I don't know enough about it, I don't know what it is, but it wouldn't surprise me if they harnessed inflections in some way that was disorienting to the incumbent. It wouldn't surprise me if they found a way to use inflections to fight an unfair fight. What I try to do with the insights is, I realized there was a theory behind it. A theory is not a recipe, it's an explanation. And what inflections let the founder do is wage asymmetric warfare on [inaudible 00:47:11]. And the insight is the vessel that they use, right? It's kind of like, the rock is the inflection, the slingshot is the insight that David shoots at Goliath. And so, that's what we're looking for, we're looking to create the conditions where we're going to get to play an unfair game by unfair rule to favor us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:32):
Great segue to the third bucket and the third element of Breakthrough Company's Future-Founder Fit. What is that?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:47:39):
Yeah, so this is one of my favorites. So a lot of times, people will say, what makes a great founder? And there are some common traits, passion for the idea, persistence, resilience, all these things that people talk about, passion for the users. But what I find is that there's no canonical best founder. So Marc Andreessen started Netscape as a programmer making minimum wage at the University of Illinois. And everybody thought the digital highway at the time was going to come from Time Warner or from Microsoft Network or from the US government, nobody thought that some kid was going to do it from the bottoms up. But it turns out that Marc was tinkering with a set of inflections around the World Wide Web. And right around that time, Microsoft introduced a better version of Windows, and right around that time, the Pentium processor came out, so there were more and more people [inaudible 00:48:36] graphical user interface computers at the very time that browsing started to happen.

(00:48:41):
But let's take another company more recent, Applied Intuition, makes simulation software for autonomous vehicles. If you're going to sell a giant contract to the CEO of a car company, he needs to look at you across the table and think, these guys can do the job. So Qasar and Peter, they'd grown up in Detroit in Michigan, they had worked at car companies in the past, in the big three, and then, they worked inside of Google at Waymo and Google Maps. And they'd had a successful startup before, and so if you looked, what is a team from Central Casting to do this, it would be them.

(00:49:22):
And so, what I mean by Founder-Future Fit is, there's a set of traits that a founder can have that make them ideally suited to a certain type of future. Sometimes they're really young first-time founders, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, we just gave the example of Marc Andreessen. In that case, usually they're at the cutting edge of a new technology and they have a beginner's mind, and they aren't even encumbered by the old way of looking things. It's like, the entire world lives in Cartesian coordinates and they discover polar coordinates, and they don't even have to translate between the two because they never understood Cartesian coordinates.

(00:50:01):
And so, in that case, their knowledge about the future is more valuable to success than their knowledge as business people. But in the case of Applied Intuition, if you're selling very large contracts to enterprise customers, they need to believe that you could do the job. If you're Okta and you're doing identity management for cloud customers, they're going to trust Todd McKinnon from Salesforce way before they're going to trust a college dropout to do that job. And so, I like to say Founder-Future Fit is, who knows the most about this future? Who has the most intrinsic motivation to pursue it? Who has the best network and keeps the best company in that ecosystem of the future? Those are the types of things that ... Founders that show up differently on those dimensions usually do better because they're more likely to understand what to build in the first place, and they're more likely to convince early believers to believe in their ideas in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:05):
So it's not that these people have some vision of the future that is more accurate or more incredible than everyone else, it's that their background, and even the way they look, matches the problem that they're going after. So in this Applied Intuition case, you're saying the founders look like people that a CEO of GM would be like, I trust these people to build this thing for me.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:51:25):
Yeah, Louis Pasteur once said, chance favors the prepared mind. And when I started working on this book, for the first time, I really understood what he meant. Chance favors the prepared mind because a prepared mind attracts luck. A prepared mind is better positioned to notice a breakthrough than other minds. And a prepared mind sees the breakthrough, sees around the corner, because they're thinking about the subject all the time. And so, most people think that the way you come up with good startup ideas is to try to think of a startup. And I like to say, no, that's exactly wrong, what you do to come up with great startup ideas is, you live in the future, and you notice what's missing in the future. And it's axiomatic, if you're living in the future, there will be unbuilt, missing things, because if it was all built, you'd be living in the present. And so, if you're living in the future and you notice what's missing, your intuition about what to build is far more likely to be right.

(00:52:32):
So Andreessen didn't do the Mosaic browser because he thought there was a market for browsers. He didn't even know about a digital highway, he was trying to make the internet immediately more useful for him and his team. And his intuition about what to build was very good because he was building the thing he wanted that was missing in the world. In the case of Okta, they knew all the early Salesforce customers, but the principle still applies, those customers weren't equal, they were lighthouse customers. It was kind of like when I was at Silicon Graphics, I didn't spend time with normal movie studios, I spent time with industrial Light & Magic, because I thought, if we solve their problem, they're going to take us to the Promised Land. All the stuff we build for Industrial Light & Magic will be the stuff that everybody wants someday. And so, not all customers are equal, you want to find customers that live in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:24):
I love this point. Justin.tv is another great example of this, where he just assumed the future, everyone's going to be watching each other's reality show, so he built his own backpack with a camera [inaudible 00:53:34] just to stream himself.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:53:34):
Yeah, and the Justin.tv example is a great one, too, because in Justin.tv, he built the thing that he wished he had, even though it was a terrible idea. But it embodied attributes, it embodied these inflections of these insights that led them ultimately to Twitch. Ironically, Justin's second company, Atrium, most people thought that that made sense, automating legal tasks. And Justin's a great founder, but Justin just didn't like the legal field, he had no passion for it. When he started Atrium, his passion was to be a higher status founder. And I've got a podcast with him recently where he talks about this, where he's like, I wanted to be as big as Patrick Collison and Brian Chesky and Drew Houston. But it turns out, that's not a very good reason to start a company. Founder-Future Fit is ultimately about authenticity, and it's about, who is the most authentically matched for that different radical future? And whoever that team is has a really big head start at getting product market fit. And product market fit is the game, whoever gets it first wins.

(00:55:28):
Okay, so there's inflections, there's insights, there's Future-Founder Fit, to make this super real for, say, a product manager sitting at a company right now, I want to start a startup, or someone just starting to ideate on ideas, what are some things that you recommend they start to do this week, next month, to start to find a big idea, or to start an idea? It doesn't have to be a big idea, an idea that'll take them somewhere.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:55:52):
The number one thing I like to say is, get out of the present. And so, people talk about getting out of the building, and of course, we should, but getting out of the-

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:56:00):
And of course we should, but getting out of the present is a little bit more subtle than that, right? So William Gibson was right when he said, "The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed." So most great startup ideas come from a future that exists right now today. And so what I like to say to people, and this is a question that I always ask when I'm pitched, "Is this from the future?" And then some people will say to me like, "Hey, I have a mental health startup. Mental health is a huge problem. It needs to be solved." And I'll say, "Why is your idea from the future?" "Well in the future I believe mental health needs to be solved." I'm like, "That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking what part of the future have you been living in that gives you the right to have an opinion about the future?"

(00:56:52):
So I like to say, "If you're not living in the future, your opinion about it isn't valid." It's like saying, "I think a customer will do X." And you've never talked to a customer. I'm like, "Okay, your opinion's interesting but irrelevant." And so the only relevant opinions about the future come from people who are living in it and coming from people who understand what's new about it in a very visceral way. And there are people who do a good job of this, like Maddie Hall who started Living Carbon. She was working at Zenefit and at first she tried to think of a startup and she had ideas that weren't that good. She had a laser tag idea and a few other things. But then she decided to go follow Sam Altman for a year to be his chief of staff.

(00:57:36):
And Sam Altman visits the future multiple times a day with people. And so that's what led her to this idea that for Living Carbon, which does genetically modified trees. I mean, it couldn't be farther away from Zenefit, right? But she saw Microsoft was about to spend a lot of money, a bunch of other companies about to spend a lot of money on carbon takeout. She saw that the genetic engineering technology was getting good enough that you could engineer these trees. She married the inflections with the need and then off she went. But she was basically sampling a lot of different futures until she found one that she liked.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):
I love that example because it makes it very real what living in the future looks like. So one is spend time with people that are very far along on some edge of technology or the way people behave. Another you shared is a work with a company, say that you work with a silicon graphics industrial related magic...

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:58:34):
[inaudible 00:58:34] magic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):
Yeah.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:58:35):
Yeah. So McCracken had a term for it that I've always liked lighthouse customers. And so the lighthouse has this light that shines out and obscures the fog. And not all customers are equal and some customers are living in the future and those customers are gold. And those customers will, if you solve their needs, take you to the promise land. So yeah, you can build what's missing for yourself like Andreessen did or Zuckerberg or Steve Wozniak or Bill Gates, or you can build something for lighthouse customers you have a good relationship with. Or if you can do neither of those things, the number one question I get asked is, "Hey, that's great if you live in a supercomputer lab or if you were selling to Industrial Light or Magic or all the Salesforce customer. I'm not one of those. I'm a second year student at Stanford Business School. I'm a product manager at company X, I'm whatever the case may be. That's where the Maddie Hall example is really powerful. Because Maddie proactively got out of the present in a very intentional way. So I love her example as a case study.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:48):
What signs tell you that a company is one of these lighthouse companies living in the future or a person is just like, you just feel it, they're so far ahead of everyone else.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:59:55):
Usually it has to do with how tech forward they are. There was a time when a lot of people didn't think the cloud was going to be a thing because it was insecure. And I'm not going to host my important data and let somebody else have it. But there were a set of customers who really excited about the cloud and they tended to adopt certain kinds of products. When I used to work in client server startups, you knew that the early adopters were people who were using relational database servers and scalable front end programming interfaces and things like that, were trying to have distributed apps that they would roll out. You could tell who was trying to play offense with the new trends.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):
Awesome. Okay, before we move on into actions, is there anything else you think might be useful to share in terms of helping people come up with an idea, find a great idea?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:00:48):
The number one thing about the ideas goes back to the not playing the comparison game. So the thing that I see people underestimate when they come up with ideas is the threshold of desperation required in the customer. So we want to solve problems for desperate people and it's like if we have powerful inflections that really empower and we have something unique, there should be somebody who is irresistibly drawn to that empowerment. They should say, "Oh my God, this is incredible. This is a game changer. I can't unsee that." Why is that important? I like to say that if a customer has the ability to do something other than what you do to solve their problem, they won't be crazy enough to do business with a startup. So customer has to be so desperate that when they see what you have, they're like, "I've got to have it."

(01:01:47):
And so I like to say, "You want to force a choice and not a comparison." If everybody's selling apples, I can't be a 10 times better Apple. I want to be the world's first banana. And I want to say to people, " You may not want bananas, you may not like them, you may not value the advantage of bananas, but if you value banana-ness, I'm the only person that's got it." It's like, "Come to papa." And so that's like an insight feels like that. And in the early days, don't spend any of your time with people who love apples because you're not going to convince them and they're going to waste your time. What you want to do is find everybody in the world that values the advantages of bananas as soon as possible, not wasting any time on the people who don't. And so I'd say that that kind of wraps up the idea of insights is it like we want to force a choice and not a comparison. Nobody looks at the Tesla cyber truck and says, oh yeah, well how does that compare to Ford F-150? And you may hate the cyber truck, you may think it's stupid, but nobody's neutral about the cyber truck. You want to have a product that people can't be neutral about, but that the people who magnetize positively to it just can't imagine a world without.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:03):
I love that. And going back to your banana example, you want just a few people to be just like, "I need that banana." No matter how much you're charging.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:03:10):
That's right. And even if it's halfway ripe, because that's the other thing, they need to be willing to tolerate the fact that you can't execute very well because how could a startup execute really well? They have no resources. And so the only chance for a startup to win is to win on a playing field where better doesn't matter where execution isn't as important as, "Got to have that thing. I'll take any version of it you give me because I am desperate for it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Speaking of execution, good segue to the second part of the chat, which is basically you looked into what do the most successful companies and founders do differently? And you also found three core things that they all do and many of them do. Movements, storytelling, disagreeableness. Let's talk about each one, pick whichever one you want to start with.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:04:04):
Yeah, so we've talked about thinking different, but it's like the problem though is that asking people to abandon the familiar for an uncertain tomorrow is a provocative act. All startups are fundamentally disagreeable. There are disagreement with how things are done, there are disagreement with the pattern of what is. And so we need as founders to persuade others to change their habits with our pattern breaking actions. And so what the pattern breaking founder does is they create a stark dichotomy between the world that is and the world that could be. And they create an irresistible desire on the part of early believers to move to that different future with them. And so I like to say there are three aspects to acting different, right? One is the other storytelling and the other is disagreeableness.

(01:04:59):
And so the movement piece is the front and centerpiece because most people when they think of movements, they think of it as more like social movements like Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King, or they think of there's artistic movements like Cubism and Picasso. But fundamentally, a movement is a different way of developing a market than how most marketing people think about developing the market. Most people when they think about marketing, they think, "Okay, I've got a set of targets, I've got a set of programs. I've got inbound and outbound. I've got these things I need to do." What a movement does is it leverages a grievance of a minority against the tyranny of a majority. And it takes that and animates it in a way that those early believers are emotionally committed to moving.

(01:05:50):
So early customers are not animated by pragmatism, they're animated by belief. Early customers, early employees, early investors don't decide to go into business with you because of the practical reasons that you unlock. They do it for aesthetic reasons. They do it because they believe what you believe. And so a movement is basically a set of people with the same belief moving together to a different future. And when you think about it's equally the same, right, for the civil rights movement. And a movement is a way to crystallize the choice. If you believe in civil rights, you can't be half in on that. You either believe that it should be about the content of people's character, not their skin color. You can't be sort of not racist. You either believe or you don't believe.

(01:06:46):
The people who followed Martin Luther King bought into the aesthetically better future that his movement promised. And it turns out, and I don't mean to equate, that was a pretty important movement, right? It's like some movements are more frivolous. I say an artistic movement. But the notion is similar in that there's a set of early believers who believe they've been enlightened about something that the rest of the world doesn't get yet. And they think that the startup founder is sort of like the prime mover of that movement. And then what happens is that startup markets happen because the movements accumulate and accelerate and more and more people join them. And what was once heresy becomes the accepted conventional wisdom and now the company's no longer a startup, it's a company, and now all of a sudden it is a valid market and all of a sudden they're the status quo and they got to watch out for the next set of disruptor. So the movement is the first key thing I think in all of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):
Is there an example? Lyft obviously comes to mind with the pink mustaches just as the future.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:07:50):
Ride-sharing was a movement. In my early days starting Floodgate with Anne, we thought that seed investing was a movement. And so we thought that there was going to be a day where seed funds would be a permanent feature of the venture landscape, but people didn't believe that in the late 2000s. And so we're like not enough that we just succeed and invest in good companies. We need to get the best LPs in the world to buy into this. We need to get Phil Horsley and Horsley Bridge and Dave Swenson at Yale and people who are respected in the ecosystem to say, "Yeah, I buy into that." And so it was really important to us to get the right early believers in our movement. Judith Elsea at Weathergage, who had just started a new firm.

(01:08:40):
One of my favorite examples is actually an old one, Clarence Bird's eye. So you go into the supermarket and there's frozen food aisle. Well, Clarence Bird's eye discovered how to flash freeze food when he was up in the Arctic looking at Eskimos, and they were flash freezing their fish and he wondered, could you do it for other things? And he found out you could fruit and vegetables, but it wasn't enough to just flash freeze the fish or the fruits or the vegetables. You had to convince the trains to have a refrigerated car. You had to convince the supermarket to have a refrigerated aisle. And so he had to start a movement where a whole lot of people simultaneously believed in this idea of being able to eat food in a more convenient way, not always in season, not always grown locally from where you were. And so all movements have that characteristic where you kind of start with a higher purpose and then you move people to that different future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:35):
I'm trying to think about what are current movements that are happening. One that might be a movement is with LLMs just this bet that transformers are the future of how this is going to work, that just more compute is the answer versus trying to find something else. Does that sound right?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:09:50):
Another one that I really like is Tesla. So Tesla's mission says, "Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy." They don't even say they're a car company. So Tesla doesn't say, "Here's why we're better than Ford and Toyota." And this is really important, right? Because the great movements do appeal to a higher purpose. They don't say, "I'm better than company X. I'm Avis, I try harder than her." They appeal to a more aesthetically higher purpose future. And then they show that this startup is the vehicle for that movement to be actualized, which is kind of a good segue to storytelling.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):
One other quick example I'm thinking about linear is kind of pushing this movement of craft and design and experience matters in B2B software. And you shouldn't settle for something that you don't love.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:10:42):
Very much so. And you know what, Chesky, I don't think he even knew he was fully doing this at the time, but Chesky did this brilliantly with Airbnb. So he created a movement around living like a local. And so the other thing that a movement does is it turns the greatest strength of the status quo into its biggest weakness. And so Brian never said, "Hotels suck. Death to the Four Season." He just said, "Hey, look, when you go to Paris, you have a choice. You can hang out in the Four Seasons and it's going to be just like the Four Seasons everywhere else in the world. It'll be in the middle of the town, or you can live in Paris like a Parisian." And he's like, "I don't have to say that the Four Seasons is bad for you to decide to choose me. And oh, by the way, if you want to stay in the same kind of hotel everywhere you go, I'm not for you."

(01:11:31):
But so now let's say you're four seasons, your whole business is predicated on doing a good job of having a common experience that people could accept and that they're used to and that they expect. And so now you've taken all of the stuff that you invested decades in and turned it into something you have to apologize for all of a sudden. And so the great startups, they create movements not so much by criticizing the incumbent, but by showing the weakness in the strength of the incumbent. And then just saying to the customer, "Hey, look, you decide it's not up to me to decide what's bad about Four Seasons. It's up to you to decide whether you value my difference or not."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:11):
It reminds me of counter positioning from Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers book.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:12:15):
A hundred percent.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):
So to make it even more practical for people that are like, "Oh, I need to come up with a movement for my startup. That's why things aren't working." It sounds like it's kind of here's how we want the future to look and why we're doing this. And then it's a combination of marketing, positioning, messaging, repeating it, social media, imagine is that roughly how to think about?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:12:37):
But I would also say that it's about storytelling. And so storytelling, there is a science to storytelling. And so for example, the hero's journey, you have somebody in the world that is the hero, let's say Luke Skywalker on Tatooine, dusty planet, he's bored out of his mind. And then a mentor shows up and offers them a call to adventure, Obi-Wan Kenobi. And at first they resist the call, but then something bad happens in this case, Luke's like, "Hey, I can't come with you. I got chores to do for Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen." But then he comes back to his place and it's all burned down the storm troopers killed his aunt and uncle. So then he accepts the call. The mentor has a tool and a magic. In this case, it was the lightsaber was the tool and the magic was the force.

(01:13:32):
And they need those things because the hero has to have a reason to credibly believe that they can beat the bad guy. And so then what happens is you find co-conspirators along the way, Han Solo, Chewy, ultimately the princess. You rescue her, you blow up the death star, you beat the empire, and then emerge, transform. They even get medals at the end of the movie, right? Now, it turns out that the exact same thing applies for startups. So if we take the Lyft example, let's just say I'm a rider. In the past, the world that is taxi suck in [inaudible 01:14:10]. I can't even get one. And when I get one, it's gross and it smells bad and it's late, and they won't take my credit cards. I have to have cash. They can't rely on them to get me there. I guess my alternatives to park, you can't ever get parking people break into your car. That's the world that is.

(01:14:28):
Logan and John would engage in a call to adventure, "Try this ride-sharing app. It shows cars on map, you know where they're all the time, they come within five minutes, fist bumped the driver." Now, this was where the genius of the pink mustache came in. So the pink mustache honored the fact that a lot of times people resist the call. It's scary to get into stranger's car. So the pink mustache made it seem a little bit less scary. When you see these cars driving around in San Francisco, you're like, "Hmm, what's up with that pink mustache?" And you're talking to your friend and they say, "Oh, it's this new thing called Lyft. It's pretty cool. It's an app if you've seen it." And so Logan and John did, among the best I've ever seen at honoring the fact that people might resist the call.

(01:15:13):
But then part of the story is languaging. This was the genius of Twitter. They didn't call it Microblogs, Inc., right? They created a metaphor around tweeting birds. The Tesla was this way, right? It wouldn't have survived a comparison with a Porsche of 9/11. The seats weren't as good, the radio wasn't as good, but Elon was telling a story about a different future. And when you bought the Tesla Roadster, you weren't buying it for practical reasons. You were buying it for aesthetic reasons. You were buying it because you thought that that future was something you wanted to be part of. So the storytelling primitive ends up working spectacularly well for startups, right? We need to describe the world that is, we need to describe the world that could be, which is that different future. We need to understand, and this is important that your job as the founder is to be Obi-Wan, not Luke.

(01:16:04):
So the founders sometimes make the mistake of thinking that they're the hero, but they're not. The early believers are the heroes, and it's the job of the founder to tell a story that emotes early believers to want to move with them and co-create the future with them. And the story you tell an employee is different from the story you tell an investor is different from the story you tell a customer because all of them have a different idea of what their hero's journey. If you're an investor, maybe your idea of being a hero is to make a hundred times your money and be on some fancy list and make money for your LPs. If you're an early customer, maybe you're a hero by solving an important business problem and getting recognized for it in your company. If you're an early employee, maybe it's you want to work on something you're excited about with really awesome people that don't waste your time with politics and bureaucracy, all of those are different journeys. All of those are different transformational ways to self-actualize. And we have to meet those people where they are and give them a reason to want to come with us to the world to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:10):
I had Nancy Duarte on the podcast. She is one of the most famous presentation designers, and she had exactly the same advice. When you're trying to tell a story, you basically bounce back between the world that is, the world that could be. What is, what could be. What is, what could be, and just keep going back and forth.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:17:25):
A hundred percent. In fact, Nancy is the person who helped me understand this better than any single person. So Nancy would show me how Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech. She'd be like, "Okay, well now notice what he does. He shows how bad phone suck now. They have styluses, they have keyboards." And then he talks about what could be, you could combine an internet communicator, you could combine an iPod, and he goes back and forth between how bad the current state of things is, how it should be, how bad it is, how it should be. Introducing the iPhone, how bad it was, how awesome it's going to be, how awesome it is. When you look at his speech, he's masterful at toggling. And by the way, the same is true. Abe Lincoln with the Gettysburg Address, "Four score and seven years ago, new nation, now we're in a civil war. We need to preserve what we stand for as a country. We need to go win this war." But he kind of goes back and forth drawing a tension between what has happened in the world that was, and the world that could be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:33):
Something that I was thinking as you were talking was, I've seen too many founders spend so much time crafting this amazing story and vision of their product, and they have this really cool blog post and big idea, but nobody really cares about their product yet. Do you have any advice of just make sure you're building something people want above all else. And the story is a layer on top of that.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:18:55):
So many startups I see the first slide is like, "We're Acme AI software. We're located in San Francisco, we're funded by X and Y VCs." That's not storytelling because you're talking about yourself, right? And if you're trying to make the person in the audience the hero, they don't care about you yet. They care about how you're going to make them a hero. And so when you kind of say, 'Okay, if I'm pitching VCs, what I really need to do is help them understand why they'll be a hero if they invest in my company according to what makes them feel heroic." What you present is different, but what a lot of startup presentations do is they take their sales pitch and they rehost it for every other audience. They rehost it for the press, for investors and for employees and all that. And that's wrong because what you're doing is you're talking about yourself to different people, but what you want to do is describe the world that could be, the stakes that are involved, and then each of those individual audiences, you want to meet them where they live in the world that is, and show them how they can engage in a transformational journey to the world it could be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:12):
And also share your amazing stats and backgrounds and market size and all that stuff.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:20:19):
Yeah. Although it's funny, I've found that investors are the same. Investors, ultimately they believe or they don't believe. A lot of times, this is the other thing I see happen, is the poor founder will get advice from 20 different people about their pitch deck. And a lot of the people giving them advice are not believers in that different future. They're giving generic startup advice or they'll go pitch a bunch of firms and they didn't consider who's prepared to possibly believe, who isn't. And so then they get objections to their pitch from people who aren't going to believe anyway, and then they try to have a slide to meet that objection. And before you know it, you have what I call a Franken deck. And so you have this huge, gigantic presentation trying to anticipate every objection, and the person who was ready to believe you in the first place doesn't know what you were trying to say because you obscured it with all this other stuff. And so I find that just like with an insight, it's okay if most investors don't like your idea, what you want to find is the ones who are prepared to move with you and make sure they absolutely know why they should. To me, that's the ideal pitch deck.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:28):
I love this advice. And just to be clear, this is like seed and pre-seed before there's a lot of traction, a lot of data and like that.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:21:35):
Exactly, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:36):
So what's your advice to a founder that's trying to iterate on their deck is it's just like, "Don't show it to too many people." Is it, "Stick to your guns."

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:21:43):
Okay, here would be my succinct advice. And other than that, there's about a million details. Slide one, you say what you do as if I literally know nothing. So it's not, "We're Airbnb, we're a marketplace for unused residential housing space." Bad. But you'll get advice that says to do that because VCs think marketplaces are hot, residential real estate's big. What you should instead say is something like, "We're Airbnb, we let you rent an extra room in your house." Because now as the VC, I'm like, ah, I know what you do. And there are a lot of pitches, I'm 10, 15 minutes in and I'm trying to understand what they do, but I don't know. So you just say, "Here's what we do."

(01:22:26):
And then the second thing that I say to people is, I think your second slide ought to be, here's the thing we know that's not obvious. So when I was raising fund one for Floodgate, I would go to an LP and say, "We believe that there's a gap between Angels and VCs. VCs are writing $5 million checks. Angels $250,000 checks. We believe that 500,000 is the new 5 million because of Lean Startups. We believe that there will be a new type of category funds called seed funds. Now, if you don't believe that, nothing else I'm about to say is going to make any sense to you, I can just give you your time back." [inaudible 01:23:06]. But then once, if they did believe that or they were in a position to lean forward, now when they start mentioning my competitors, I say, "Okay, well, recall Peter Fenton works at Benchmark, he's not going to compete with me because why would Peter Fenton leave Benchmark to start Seed Fund doesn't make sense. The only people who are going to try to compete with me from the big funds are the people who aren't performing."

(01:23:26):
But if you set the context of what your insight is, you can always come back to it. When they bring up competitors, you can always come back to it when they bring up objections and you can say, "Hey, remember I'm just telling you we need to agree on this insight for this to have a chance of being great." So what do we do? What's our insight? And then slide three is what, if any, proof points do we have? We have any customers? Do we have great founders? Is there something happened already that should cause you to believe that my insight is vowed?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:02):
I love this. I love this tangent we went on...

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:24:00):
... site is out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:02):
Love this. I love this tangent we went on. Let me come back to the actions that you found the most successful startups end up taking. We've talked about movements, we've talked about storytelling. The third is my favorite, I'm excited to hear you talk about it, which is disagreeableness. What is that about?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:24:19):
Earlier, I'd mentioned that you want to escape the comparison trap when you have your insight and when you have your idea, in creating movements and telling stories, you want to break free from the conformity trap. We always are under pressure to conform in this world, and people use the pressure of conformity to prevent us from exploring things outside of our limits. There's a book that I love called Jonathan Livingston Seagull, where there's a seagull who wants to fly at infinite speed, and all the other seagulls are like, "Look, we're just destined to eat crap off the surface of the ocean. That's just what we are. We're seagulls." He ends up getting banished from the flock because everybody thinks he's crazy. To me, the great founders are kind of like Jonathan Livingston Seagull. They're willing to pursue something that they're obsessed with, that they think has to happen in this world, and they're willing to sacrifice their status in the socioeconomic sometimes dominance hierarchy because fulfilling the mission is ultimately more important to them than fitting in.

(01:25:31):
You can't stand out if you always fit in. The only people who are different can really make a difference. That's kind of the mindset. I like to say a startup is a fundamentally disagreeable act in the first place, and there's going to be times you need to be disagreeable. I've seen this time and again. I hear people say to me, "I want to work with a founder who's coachable." I'm like, "I'm not really sure." Sometimes I used to joke that when I would meet with Ev Williams, my whole job was to give him advice that he ignored. I would say to him, "Hey, Ev. I don't think you should raise that much money, because I think you'll spend whatever you raise in 18 months, no matter how much you raise." He said, "Man, so you mean that startups almost always spend their money in 18 months regardless of the amount?" I said, "Yeah. I call it Mike's Law. It almost always happens, because once you have the money, all the pressure is on you to spend it."

(01:26:26):
He is like, "Man, that is a really good advice. I'd never thought of it that way before. That sounds right to me." Well, he proceeds to go raise a shitload of money, but he did stuff that I didn't think he should do, but it worked. I liked that in him. A lot of people would say, "Well, doesn't it bother you that he didn't listen to you that much?" No, because he was disagreeable, and he was the right kind of disagreeable. He didn't say, "Pound the sand. I'm not listening to you. La-la-la, I'm covering my ears." He listened and he understood what I thought the truth was. He just believed a different truth than I did, and that's fine. My job as the investor is to just help them see what my perception of the truth is, honestly. If they decide to go in a different direction, that's great. They're the founder, they're the genius.

(01:27:22):
All of them, not all of them, but a whole lot of them are more disagreeable than history lets on. My dad worked for Bill Gates when he was at Microsoft. Bill Gates is not a warm and fuzzy dude. He was tough. He was a hard ass. But great people are inspired by hard asses, as long as the hard ass makes ... You meld the steel in the heat of the flame of high standards. Sometimes people can't work for Elon Musk for very long, but almost everybody I know who's worked for him really respects him, because he has high standards, and he's not trying to win friends and influence people. He's trying to land on Mars, and if you're going to land on Mars, you got to be disagreeable some of the time. I just find that that is a trait that is under-appreciated in these great founders quite often.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):
What you just shared reminds me of a recent podcast episode of Jeffrey Pfeffer, which I know you listened to, where he talks about the rules of power, how people acquire power, and the last rule is, "Understand that once you have acquired power, what you did to get it will be forgiven, forgotten, or both." Your Bill Gates example, I think, is a good one where people look at him as such a nice dude when, as you said, he was not so nice a lot of the time.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:28:43):
Here's the other thing, and by the way, I listened to that episode from beginning to the end, and I thought it was fantastic, because the next thing I want to do is go to Professor Pfeffer and say, "Can we cast these seven principles through a pattern breaking lens?" Let's assume you're a startup capitalist, you're not at a company, because changing the future requires you to acquire a different form of power than you would, say, in an organization. But as I was listening to it, I was like, "These principles all apply to pattern breakers, all of them, every single one." The other one is that I think that he said, "Not everybody's going to like you. If you want to be liked, get a dog. But if you want power, there's certain things you're going to have to do and reconcile yourself with."

(01:29:36):
Acquisition of power has this notion of you've got to wield the carrot and the stick. If all you do is wield the carrot, you won't create enough activation energy for people to move to that different future. Sometimes you do have to use the stick, and sometimes you have to realize that people are going to use your desire to fit in against you. They're going to say, "Oh, you can't do that. That's illegal," or, "You can't do that, that's unethical," or, "You can't do that. You're being some tech bro, bad guy." A lot of what I find with the founders I work with, ironically, before they win, they have to have the courage to be disliked because people don't like their idea. They think it's stupid, lonely.

(01:30:20):
But then after they win, it's even worse, because everybody says you cheated or you're a bad guy or you broke the rules or you're too powerful, or, "Who gave you the right to decide what the future should be?" They get criticized unfairly in the other direction after they succeed, but in the end, it comes with the territory. It's part of the job description, unfortunately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:43):
Yeah. Elon goes through a lot of that. Something I saw you tweet recently along these same lines is that most successful companies, there's tons of chaos internally, and everyone working at these companies is like, "This place a mess. How is this even working?" But your finding is that that's very common and normal.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:31:00):
Especially in startups. There have been times when I've said things like, "Execution doesn't matter," and people can misinterpret that. When I mean execution doesn't matter, I don't mean people shouldn't get things done or people shouldn't say, "What did you do this week?" But when I think of execution in a corporate sense, corporations in theory should always win. They have big management team, they have more experienced people, they have customers, suppliers, partners, brand, so a startup never beats a big company by executing better than the big company. Startup wins over the big company because it proposes a radically different future, disorients the incumbent, and sort of chaotically moves people to that different future.

(01:31:46):
But like every startup I've ever seen, on the inside was wild. It was like a capitalist mutation. It was trying to find a beaked finch in the Galapagos Islands that's never been discovered before, and it's all ambiguous all the time, and people are arguing about what the right direction is all the time. It's just messy, but movements are messy. That's what comes with the territory. A friend of mine, Robin Roberts, once said, "Make your mess your message." It's so true.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:24):
Oh, man. That's so funny. I love it. I have a couple more questions before we wrap up. Before we leave the actions categories, is there anything else you think is important to share, any other lessons that we haven't touched on?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:32:37):
I think, Lenny, I don't know if you've consciously tried to do this or not, but on some level you've created a movement. No one has ever engaged people with product management sensibilities the way you have. I go to your site, and you even have merch for product managers. I'm like, "What?" I imagine the early posts that you wrote, it probably felt kind of lonely. It's probably, "I wonder if anybody's even reading this stuff," but it starts to accumulate. More people start to read it, more people start to tell their friends about it, and now all of a sudden, it kind of becomes a thing. In many ways, Lenny's podcast and Lenny's blog and Lenny's newsletter are all examples of facets of this movement that you're creating.

(01:33:26):
But your movement is not just about the stories you tell or the guests you have or the podcasts or the write-ups you have. You have a point of view about the centrality of a product manager in companies and in businesses and in the future, and honoring that the way Nike honors athletes. The point of view is the movement, just like the point of view is the company when it's a startup. This point of view is the story. It's the place that people want to go that got animated by the beliefs that you share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:06):
Fascinating and flattered. I have no intention of starting a movement. I could see what you're saying. That sounds like a lot of stress, but I guess-

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:14):
I think you already have, whether you met to or not, I think you have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:17):
All right. Well, I do have swag, and if you're on YouTube, this is our best-selling item, a hat that just says "Product Manager." People love it. I have it in the background. [inaudible 01:34:26]

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:25):
Can I wear one if I'm still not one?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):
Absolutely. You've been one, and so forever product manager. I'll send you a hat.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:33):
Hopefully, I can get grandfathered in for my past.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:35):
Forever. Forever PM Mike. Okay. I just have one more question, and this is around your last chapter, which I think is going to be useful to a lot of people. Your last chapter is about how to apply a lot of these principles to working at a company. Say you're not a founder, a lot of these principles still apply. What advice can you share for people, say, a PM, instead of large company to help them find pattern-breaking ideas, big ideas within the company?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:58):
The first thing I think is important to understand is that everything about a value delivery system when you're doing a pattern-breaking idea is different from a normal idea. The mistake that most companies make is they say, "I've got this new pattern-breaking idea. It needs to be a third of my business in 24 months or three years or whatever." Bad strategy. Let's take a company like, say, Apple, when they did the iPhone. The iPhone was a whole new thing. It was driven by, in this case, Steve Jobs the founder. You couldn't reconcile it with the original business of the Mac and not really even the iPod. You had to treat it as a totally different thing, and that's really hard for companies. Companies make the mistake of engaging in a pattern-breaking product, but they make it too visible or it's a career-limiting move if it fails. Pattern-breaking products have different types of leadership, different types of go-to-market motion as we've described, different types of ideas, different risk profiles. Instead of saying this company or this business is too big to fail, I need to make small bets that can fail a lot. The same is true with mergers and acquisitions. If I buy a company, I need to ask, am I buying a pattern-breaking company to break the pattern of my business and go in a radically new direction, or am I buying a company that's an extension of my current business? Neither is wrong per se, but the way you think about risk varies enormously.

(01:36:43):
Some examples that I have in the book of good examples are the iPhone, Steve Jobs, AWS, but some people objected. They said, "Okay, that's easy for the founders to do because they're founders of the company, and that's Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos." The other example I like is Skunkworks with Lockheed. When they created a fighter plane in a very short amount of time, and that's how they did it, they had an organization totally separate from the main organization, somebody with absolute power, and tried to make it not visible, tried to make it be separate. Because when you make it visible, you start to drift it back into the tractor beam of acting like a pattern-matching corporation. Another good example back in the day was Don Estridge at IBM when they did the IBM PC, but it's almost always an autonomous business headed by a maverick, and you're trying to do something discreetly different rather than a better version of what you've already.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:45):
This aligns very well with, we had two recent podcast episodes talking to PMs at companies that are doing zero-to-one stuff, Mihika and Tanguy. Tanguy had a really interesting tidbit along the lines you just talked about where he set up his team in a totally different time zone so that people that wanted to bug them just were sleeping during that time, and they weren't even online so that they could just focus on the work they were doing, and it worked out.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:38:09):
I'm mostly through that episode, and everything that I've listened to so far, I'm like, "Okay, that totally jives with what I've seen." The other person has an interesting take on this is Vinod Kochblok. Vinod basically thinks that what companies should do is take some portion of their profits, let's say 10% of your profits, and invest it in projects likely to fail, but with wildly asymmetric upside if they succeed, and then make them not visible to the mothership in the early inning. It's your willingness to fail that lets you have breakthrough success.

(01:38:49):
Any coin that says can't lose bad on one side of it might as well say, can't win big on the other side. It's your willingness to fail, and it comes back to departing from the consensus, right? It's your willingness to fail that enables success, and every time you depart from the consensus, there's a chance you'll be wrong, you'll underperform the consensus, but it's your willingness to do that that lets you outperform it. But there's no shortcuts, right? The coin that says can't lose, says can't win on the other side, and lose big says, win big on the other side.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:26):
Mike, this episode is so full of nuggets, tactical advice, amazing stories, everything I was hoping it would be. Before we get to our very exciting lightening round, is there anything else that you think might be useful to share with folks that are trying to start a company or are already along with a company?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:39:45):
Yeah. The one thing I would say is that it's a lonely existence, and it's okay if most people don't like your idea. It doesn't mean you're right, but it sure as heck doesn't mean you're wrong either. There's not enough people in this world willing to stick their neck out for things that they believe that they see before the rest of us. Just for what it's worth, if anybody in your audience is one of those people, you have just my utmost respect and affection. I hope that in those times when it's tempting to not believe, it comes with the territory every great founder has faced, and it doesn't make you wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:34):
Amazing. What an empowering, inspiring way to end it. Mike, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:40:34):
Okay, here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:44):
Here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:40:50):
A book called The Five Regrets of the Dying, Top Five Regrets of the Dying by Bronnie Ware. She was a hospice nurse, and she would talk to people in the last 90 days of their lives, and she would find out the things that they'd wish that they had done in their lives that they hadn't. I always thought that that was a good book, because it reminds you about what's important, and it reminds you that it isn't going to last forever. Someday, it'll be the last day.

(01:41:20):
There's another book that I really like called Chase, Chance, and Creativity by a guy named James Austin, and I think that it's a good book because it talks about how certain people tend to attract luck more than others and actually that luck is created, you do make luck. I am just fascinated by this idea of luck and how it can be harnessed. I'd say those two. There's a whole bunch of them. I've always liked all of Clay Christensen's books. The other one that I kind of liked that I read recently is by Robert Greene, The Laws of Human Nature. I liked that one a lot as well. Then Nancy Duarte's book, Resonate, we talked about Nancy earlier, I like that book a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:13):
I'm buying that first one immediately. That sounds incredible. I need that book. Regrets of the Dying. I found it on Amazon as you were talking, and I'm buying it. Good pick there. Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:42:26):
I really liked the movie about Enzo Ferrari, and I have this huge affinity for 1960s cars, and the way that they replicated these 1960s Ferraris I just thought was magical. I thought that the guys that did the special effects and just the attention to detail I thought was just extraordinary.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:50):
I have not seen it. Quick aside, as I was buying this book, your book was recommended on Amazon for me, so good job.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:42:50):
Oh, good. Okay. Here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:58):
Good job, Amazon. I will point people to where to find it at the end of this series of questions, but next question, is there a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:43:08):
When I was young, before I got into computers, I had a job as a professional calligrapher, and so I really like using calligraphy pens. Not long ago I sort of discovered the world, it had been a long time since I'd reconnected with that hobby, I discovered the world of vintage fountain pens. My favorite product of recent times, everybody will be like that sounds esoteric, but it's a Mont Blanc 149 first generation celluloid pen. It was right after World War II, and it was the Germans coming back saying, "We've still got it." It was just a product for the ages. It has a flexible nib. Fountain pens don't work the way they used to. They used make flexible nibs so that you could write the way scribes wrote in the 1800s and stuff. But then people in the modern world break those nibs, and they use ballpoint pens anyway. But when I use these old flexible pens from 1900 to the 1940s, they're just magical. There's just nothing like it. Nobody's ever been able to equal that experience in modern times.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:25):
Wow. I got to try one of these pens.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:44:28):
Yeah. I'll give you one of them so you can at least get a feel for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:33):
Wow. I'll give you a product management hat, I'll get a pen, a beautiful pen. I think I win in this exchange. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with folks that you find useful to come back to?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:44:47):
I learned it from my dad. It sounds simple, but it's kind of profound, "Do your best." What he meant by that is he didn't mean be the best, he meant that life is a gift. You don't know how much time you're going to have. Every day is the gift of your time, and the best way to honor the gift of your time is to do your best. There'll be times you won't be the best, but if all you did was the best, that's all you could do. I remember one time, so I was a senior in high school, I'd already gotten into Stanford, I'm totally psyched, I'm going to go. Last week of the semester of senior year, and I have a test the next day in English.

(01:45:29):
My dad's like, "Hey, how are you feeling about the test?" I said, "It doesn't really matter. I get to drop it, and I'm going to get an A in the class, because I've got the goods, so I don't need to do well on it." He looked so disappointed at me, and he was like, "It doesn't sound like you're doing your best." What he was kind of getting at was that the people who achieve greatness, they think everything counts. I always got a lot from that with him. There'd be other times where I wouldn't do so well on something, and he would say, "Well, sometimes you make a careless mistake, but you did your best. That's all you could have done."

(01:46:15):
The idea of doing your best I find to be very profound, and it causes you to realize that the best way to show up in the world is to be your best self. There's only one you in this world, and the more that you can show up as your best self, you'll be impossible to compete with, you won't feel the need to copy other folks, you won't feel the need to compare yourself to other people. You'll compare yourself instead to the idea of perfection itself and whatever that means in terms of your own ability to do your best. To me, that's probably the most important life lesson I've learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:52):
Wow. As you said, very simple but very powerful.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:46:56):
It's powerful when you truly internalize it, right? When you take it beyond an aphorism, it's very powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:03):
It reminds me of your partner, Anne Marie Coe's advice that she got from her dad, which is I think maybe the opposite that she shared on Tim Ferris' podcast of just always do a world-class job at everything you do. You're doing a world-class job.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:47:18):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:19):
Amazing. Okay, I'm going to skip the last question just to end on that, because that was way too beautiful to Sully with another question. Just to give folks a chance to figure out where to buy your book, when it's available, how to find it, what they should know, do share.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:47:36):
I guess there's two main ways, right? Well, we've got a Substack. Not everybody's got to buy books, right, so there's patternbreakers.substack.com. Then I have a site, patternbreakers.com, but you can also get the book on Amazon or anywhere. It's already available for pre-order, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:54):
Amazing. I usually ask people how listeners can be useful to you. I imagine it's check out the book, share what you've learned.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:47:59):
My main goal is for the ideas to spread and to help people. Hopefully, it will have achieved that goal. But just anything that people can do to help spread the ideas. Co-conspirators wanted.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:15):
I love these episodes where somebody like you spends hundreds of thousands of hours analyzing data and history and startups and talking to founders and just synthesizing all the things you've learned into a couple of hours. I love this. Thank you, Mike, so much for being here and for sharing all this wisdom with us.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:48:32):
Hey. Well, thanks, Lenny. It was an honor to be on your show, and it's been fun to see you do so well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:37):
Thanks, Mike. It's an honor to have you on the show. Again, the book is called Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future. Mike, thank you so much for being here.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:48:45):
Okay. See you, Lenny. Thanks.

# “I like being scared”: Molly Graham’s frameworks for rapid career growth | Molly Graham

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You've worked with many very high performing founder CEOs. Zuck, Cheryl Sandberg. Larry and Sergei at Google. Brett Taylor.

Molly Graham (00:00:07):
Google, when I was there, felt like two PhD students paradise. Facebook felt like 19-year-old hacker's dorm room. 80% of the culture of a company is literally defined by the personality of the founder. Our job as operators or as leaders is to help articulate the culture that they're creating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
When a lot of people think Molly Graham, a lot of people think of giving away your Legos.

Molly Graham (00:00:28):
You have to grow as fast as your company is growing if you really want to take advantage, both learning to give away what you've gotten good at and move on to the next shiny pile of Legos.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
Sarah Caldwell. She told me that the framework that helped her most in her career is something that you call the J-curve versus stairs.

Molly Graham (00:00:46):
So Chamath, when he pitched me on this job, actually drew me a picture on a whiteboard. He said, the way a lot of people do careers is a set of stairs. Just walk up the stairs and you'll get promoted every two years. But that is boring. The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs and you do fall, but then you climb out way beyond where the stairs could ever get you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):
Today, my guest is Molly Graham. Molly was an early employee at Google, also at Facebook, where she worked closely with Zuck on building the Chan Zuckerberg initiative. She also worked with Brett Taylor on scaling Quip, which he sold to Salesforce. She's also worked with hundreds of companies and founders helping them grow into the leaders that they want to become. Today, she leads Glue Club, which is a community for leaders operating in changing, growing environments who want to develop themselves as quickly as their companies. Molly is maybe most known for her advice to give away your Legos, which we chat about. Along with basically all of her favorite frameworks and mindsets and pieces of advice that she's developed and collected over time. For leaders who are going through rapid scale and growth and are just struggling to keep up. I think of this episode as a high growth handbook for leaders who are experiencing rapid scale.

(00:01:58):
We cover the J curves versus stairs approach to career growth, the waterline model, and why you want to snorkel before you scuba. Her six rules for creating goals and building alignment, her rules of thumb for dealing with rapid scale and lots of change. The biggest lessons she's learned from Zuck and Sergei and Larry and Cheryl and Brett Taylor and so much more. Molly is incredible and you will be a better leader after listening to this episode. A huge thank you to Eric Antonow, Ashley Murphy and Sarah Caldwell for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.

(00:03:01):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX, the developer intelligence platform designed by leading researchers. To thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly. But many organization leaders struggle to answer pressing questions like, which tools are working? How are they being used? What's actually driving value? DX provides the data and insights that leaders need to navigate this shift. With DX, companies like Dropbox, booking.com, Addien, and Intercom get a deep understanding of how AI is providing value to their developers. And what impact AI is having on engineering productivity. To learn more, visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.

(00:03:44):
If you're a founder, the hardest part of starting a company isn't having the idea. It's scaling the business without getting buried in back office work. That's where Brex comes in. Brex is the intelligent finance platform for founders. With Brex, you get high limit corporate cards, easy banking, high yield treasury, plus a team of AI agents that handle manual finance tasks for you. They'll do all the stuff that you don't want to do, like file your expenses, scour transactions for waste, and run reports all according to your rules. With Brex's AI agents, you can move faster while staying in full control. One in three startups in the United States already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com. Molly, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Molly Graham (00:04:36):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):
I feel like this conversation was in an inevitability. I feel like you're the kind of guest where it's like, we will do this someday. I'm such a fan of your stuff. I've read all the stuff you've put out there over the years. We're going to be talking about the best frameworks and mindsets that you've developed over the years that have been really helpful to you, to founders, to companies that you've worked with to help them with growth and scale and change and all the stuff that comes with success. The way I think about this, I want to make this the greatest hits of Molly Graham.

Molly Graham (00:05:06):
Love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:08):
And so I sourced what I think are the greatest hits from a lot of colleagues that you've worked with, a lot of people you've worked with. We've chatted about the stuff that you find other people find most helpful. So we're going to be going through all that stuff. But let's help people understand why they should listen to this advice. What's kind of the backstory on these frameworks? Where did they come from? Where did you develop them? Tell us that story.

Molly Graham (00:05:29):
So first of all, Ami Vora, who you have had on your podcast, once said to me that all advice is just someone telling you what they did. And I always think about that. Because I really think that basically what I tell people is I've made every single mistake in the book. And then I got to the end of the book and I started inventing new mistakes. So mostly what I feel is that I like sharing my stories because I want to help people. I want to help people not make the same mistakes I did. And I also want to help people make sense of what they're experiencing. But I started in tech in 2007. I actually started at Google the week the iPhone launched and a lot of my scaling battle scars come from a couple of experiences. They come from a year and a half at Google, which is not very long.

(00:06:17):
And Google was pretty big when I was there. It has thousands of employees. But my department, which was the communications department, was 25 people when I joined and it grew in nine months to 125 people. And that was really my first experience with just all the sort of things that I still talk about today. In terms of what it feels like to grow really, really fast and sort of all the tools that I started developing from there. After Google, I left and followed Cheryl Sandberg and Elliot Schrage to Facebook. And I spent five years at Facebook. And I joined Facebook in 2008, and it's important context because it was 80 million users at the time. We were smaller than MySpace. It was 270 million in revenue, 500 employees. It did not feel inevitable. Most people thought we were going to sell it to Microsoft. When I told people I was going there, they were like, isn't that place just like a site for college kids? And so I was there for five years and it was a crazy five years.

(00:07:22):
When I left, it was 5,500 employees, five billion in revenue, over a billion users. So a huge amount of what I experienced, what I write about, what I talk about in Glue Club, which is the community that I run, comes from that rapid scale at Google and Facebook. But I also, I left Facebook right after we went public, about six months after we went public. And I only like doing jobs that I'm highly unqualified for. I like being on learning curves so steep that I'm scared I'm going to fall off. And so I left and I wanted to learn what it took to build something from nothing. And so I joined this little startup founded by Brett Taylor, a startup called Quip. I joined a couple of months before we launched and ran everything that wasn't product and engineering there for him. And that was such a valuable experience to me because the experience of building something from nothing is actually quite different than the experience of holding on for dear life while things are scaling so fast around you.

(00:08:27):
And it really taught me about all the tools and skills you need to go from zero to one and then from one to two and how lonely it can be to build something. And we eventually sold that company to Salesforce. And then again, only take jobs I'm highly unqualified for. But the last really chaotic scaling experience I had was actually helping Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan start their philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. And I basically helped them for the first two years of its existence or its sort of like first full existence. And philanthropy sounds calm. You know what I mean? We're like, oh, giving money away. Must be so peaceful over there. And CZI grew from, I think the week I joined, it was 30 people and we bought two companies that week and it grew to 250 people that year. And it was like using every single tool in my toolkit that I had taken from every other job that I'd had.

(00:09:22):
So my advice and frameworks, like I said, come from having made a lot of mistakes. But I've also sort of made a personal study over the last 18 years, believe it or not. Essentially what does it take to thrive inside growing and changing companies, not just to hang on for dear life. What does it take to lead in the face of constant change? And really the other piece that I find truly fascinating is what genuinely makes the difference between a business that grows but then plateaus versus these generational businesses. The ones that go on forever. Sort of the difference between a Twitter or MySpace and a Facebook. Billions in revenue versus hundreds of billions in revenue. So what I like to do is take my experience and use it to help other leaders. I want to give people tools that work. And I also want to be honest about how hard all of this stuff really is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Amazing. I say this a lot in this podcast. I just love the ROI that listeners of the podcast get. You spent 20 years toiling, struggling, working so hard, learning so much. And you're just here, here's all the answers that I've learned. And obviously not all the answers, but so many things that will help people avoid the pain and suffering that you've gone through.

Molly Graham (00:10:43):
That's the goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:45):
Also, a couple quick threads I want to follow here. One is Ami Vora, who you mentioned. She's now, I think, head of product at Anthropic.

Molly Graham (00:10:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
Amazing. Former podcast guest, also speaker at Lenny and Friends Summit two years ago. This other point you just made about how you've always gone to places that have been way beyond your... I forget how you phrased it, but just beyond your current capabilities almost. And were very difficult. I just had Matt McGinnis on the podcast. He's CEO at Rippling, now CPO at Rippling, and just recorded an episode with him. And he had this really powerful quote that if you're ever comfortable at work and feel like, oh, I got this, you're making a huge mistake. Something's going terribly wrong. That's not where you want to be.

Molly Graham (00:11:23):
Yeah. I always say I get bored really easily, which is both a strength and probably my greatest weakness. So I like being scared.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
Okay. So let's actually dive into some of your greatest hits of frameworks. And the greatest of all greats, when a lot of people think Molly Graham, a lot of people think of giving away your Legos. Some people haven't heard of this, many people have, so let's cover this. What is this advice of giving away your Legos?

Molly Graham (00:11:47):
So this definitely started in my experience at Google. And then Facebook was a masterclass in giving away the Legos. But the way I like to talk about it is basically when I watch leaders and employees go through rapid scale, I like to think of somebody putting down a giant pile of Legos in front of a bunch of kindergartners and then just being like, build something. And that's sort of what it feels like when you start. It's like, well, there's so many Legos and it's so fun. There's a lot of opportunity, but it's also kind of scary and overwhelming. And you're like, there's so many Legos. What do I do? Isn't there an instruction manual hidden under this pile somewhere? But then you start building and you're like, oh, okay. You build something and then you take it apart and then you put it back together.

(00:12:33):
And then eventually you start to get momentum and you're like, okay, it's like I'm building a house. I got this. It's a house. All right, great. And then you're like, I'm good at building houses. I was put on earth to build houses. And almost assuredly inside of scaling companies, as soon as you're like, I feel good at this and I should do this forever. Somebody's going to show up and be like, okay, it's not a house. It's a neighborhood. And you need to take this house that's kind of half built and you're going to pass it off to this other person that we just hired. And you are going to go build dog parks and streets and other things that are entirely unhouse-like. And what happens when someone does that to you is you're like, wait a minute. First of all, I'm not done with this house. And I'm worried that this person's going to screw it up.

(00:13:18):
I'm also worried that building houses is actually the most fun thing and that I'm going to give the Legos to that person and they're going to have all the fun work and I'm going to hate building dog parks. Or that dog parks are irrelevant eventually and it's going to turn out we're in the house building business. So there's this incredible set of emotions that come territorialistic, paired with excitement. Fear paired with joy. But eventually you pass the house off and then you go work on neighborhoods and you're sort of like, okay, dog parks, I'm good at dog parks. I got this. And then again, you get to the like, I'm great. I was put on earth to build neighborhoods. And immediately someone shows up and says, it's not a neighborhood. It's a country or a city or a world. And it just goes on and on and on.

(00:14:03):
And for me, learning this muscle of both learning to give away what you've gotten good at and move on to the next shiny pile of Legos. And learning that the emotions associated with that are inevitable. I've been doing this for 18, 20 years, I still get attacked by these emotions all the time, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't give them away and move on to the next thing.

(00:14:33):
That is both the torment of scaling companies, which is that the ground is moving under your feet. And as soon as you're comfortable, someone will make sure that you are uncomfortable, but it's also the opportunity, which is that you can go from being someone that's good at building houses to someone that knows how to build entire worlds. And that is where the Legos metaphor came from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
That is such a good metaphor. And if you've gone through this, you so understand what this is like and what... And also just the Legos is metaphor is so good for the different things you build.

Molly Graham (00:15:06):
I have a very weird brain that for some odd reason just always thinks in metaphors.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):
[inaudible 00:15:11].

Molly Graham (00:15:11):
So it showed up when I was... At Facebook in particular, I would find that every so often I would have to have what I called a Legos talk with someone where I would just see them start to ask these questions like, why are we hiring that person? Or what's that team even do? And I was like, okay, we need to have the chat about the Legos. And then eventually it turned into an article and a whole thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):
A whole thing. And just to be clear, the advice is give away your Legos, this is actually the path to a successful career.

Molly Graham (00:15:40):
I have watched a lot of people over many years struggle with feeling like they should hang on to the thing that they've been good at. And it almost always... Because, you know, essentially the nature of a scaling company is that the Lego pile is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger however fast that graph is going up into the right. I always say that's the graph of how fast your business is growing. It's the graph of how fast your company is expanding. And it's the graph of how fast your job is getting bigger. That means that if you actually just stay and build houses, eventually you're literally buried under a pile of Legos. Do you know what I mean? You held onto something that's down here and the opportunity is actually to stay on top of that pile and to learn to just give away your job every so often.

(00:16:27):
At Facebook, I got to a place where I was literally giving away my job every three weeks. I was constantly rehiring myself essentially because you have to sort of grow as fast as your company is growing if you really want to take advantage of the opportunity that comes with companies that are growing and changing quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:45):
So people are hearing this, they're like, okay, my rational brain's like, I should give away my Legos. It'll help me. It'll be good for my career. In real life, it's very hard to actually do. To give away this empire that you've built, this team that you've built. This project that you're like, oh, this is going to be my thing. I know you have a really fun, useful tool to help people deal with that kind of irrational part of their brain. Talk about that.

Molly Graham (00:17:07):
So like I said, my brain works in weird metaphors. It's a weird brain. I was raised on The Muppets, and I like to think that this one came from, I guess, growing up watching weird animals. But basically, at some point I realized that this emotional rollercoaster that comes with scaling, with growing. With going through change, any kind of change. People feel that. Was never going to go away. And that no matter how good I got... Sometimes I think it gets worse the more senior you get, actually. Because you sort of feel like you're supposed to know what you're doing, and then you just get attacked by this monster that's like, who even gave you this job in the first place? So basically I externalized all these emotions that come with change into this little tiny monster. I named my monster, Bob. Your monster can be named whatever you want him to be named or her or them.

(00:17:56):
And Bob's job... I like to think his job is basically to make me the worst version of myself. He's the one that's like, oh, that person took all the fun Legos and you should go push them over and grab them back. Bob's job is... Bob's the one that wants to send the rage emails at 9:00PM and burn the house down. And the thing to learn about Bob is that, like I said, Bob never goes away. Bob is someone that you have to learn to deal with. But Bob's job is to make you the worst version of yourself. So your job is to let Bob do his thing, but not act on the emotions. Basically, all these emotions are normal and they are not useful. They are not the compass that should be telling you what to do.

(00:18:46):
But the other rule I have for managing Bob is a lot of people are like, oh, you're feeling off or tired or whatever. Go to bed and wake up tomorrow morning and you'll feel better. And the truth is that you're like, I want to send the rage email at 9:00PM. You still want to send it at 8:00AM. And a lot of these emotions just do not go away in 24 hours. So my rule of thumb from Facebook was give it two weeks. And the emotional, the sort of Bob... Bob is like these waves and they just roll through. So you made a new hire or somebody came in or you got layered or whatever. You'll have a set of reactions. And those reactions, again, they're normal, but they're not useful. They're not the ones that you should listen to. They are Bob.

(00:19:29):
And typically they go away in a couple of days, you get something new. Some new wave. But anything that lasts longer than two weeks is actually something you should pay attention to. It's something that if it's been around for two weeks, it's something you should go talk to someone about. Whether it's a manager or a friend or a coach or someone like that. That's the real stuff. Everything else is just Bob.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:50):
Is there a rule of thumb for when it actually, when you shouldn't give away your Legos? When it's like, okay, maybe you should fight back on this layering or whatever.

Molly Graham (00:20:00):
No rule of thumb. In general, I would actually say embracing change is far better than fighting it. And almost invariably, you cannot see what is around the corner, but it is almost always the thing to focus on. A lot of times I think inside of change, we get focused on the past, and one of the most valuable things you can do as a manager and a leader is help people focus on the future. I think... I'm sure there are times when people have done it and regretted it and it has led them somewhere.

(00:20:42):
I think being layered, for example, is one of the hardest things for people inside these experiences where someone brings in a manager above you. And I've also seen so many stories of that ending up being a great thing for someone. Even though they couldn't see it at the time. So in general, I would just say, step into the future and let the past go and see what you're going to learn. And sometimes you'll learn that it's time to leave or that this isn't the right pile of Legos for you. But it'll end up taking you somewhere that's worth exploring. Holding onto things almost always leads us to the worst version of ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):
It's a very Buddhist way of thinking too. Just don't cling.

Molly Graham (00:21:31):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
Yeah. And I think another part of this metaphor, I don't know if you think of it this way. Is the Legos aren't even your Legos, right? They're like the CEO's Legos, the shareholders' Legos. So you think they're your Legos, but no, you're not in charge.

Molly Graham (00:21:42):
Well, it is... I will say one of the hard-earned things is it can feel very emotional and it can feel very personal. It can feel like your work... I don't know, it can feel like your life is on the line sometimes. Just your work life. Oh, gosh, this matters so much. And one of the things that you learn as you get more senior and just have seen stuff is it's going to be okay. A friend of mine says, careers are long and nobody tells you that. But they're long. And this moment feels so dire and it feels so hard and it feels scary and it's going to be okay. So yeah, it is hard to know in the moment. And I think the story is going to be long and this is going to be one chapter or maybe even a part of a chapter, not a whole chapter. So embrace the length.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):
To build on that point, I've realized this is my fourth career doing what I do now. Whatever the hell this is. I was a engineer and then I was a founder. Then I was a product manager, and then what the hell I do now. Whatever this is, that's a whole different path.

Molly Graham (00:22:52):
You don't have a name for it yet, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:55):
I don't. I hate all the terms people use for this world.

Molly Graham (00:22:58):
Somebody called me an influencer and I almost ripped their face off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:00):
Yeah. [inaudible 00:23:02].

Molly Graham (00:23:02):
[inaudible 00:23:02].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:03):
Yeah.

Molly Graham (00:23:04):
Yeah, man. The most interesting careers are winding and they have starts and stops and failures and successes and control. Anybody that's been through a lot of this stuff, control is usually not the name of the game. It's usually just like, "Let's see what happens. We're going to try this and we're going to see what happens next."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):
This is a great segue to another framework that I've heard from folks you've worked with that have been really impactful on them. So, Sarah Caldwell, who's a big deal at OpenAI, she told me that the framework that helped her most in her career is something that you call the J-Curve versus Stairs career growth framework. Talk about what that's about.

Molly Graham (00:23:46):
I actually gave a TED Talk about this one a couple of years ago because I am so passionate about it, but you can listen to the very packaged eight-minute version of this, but I will tell you the real story because it's very relevant to a lot of folks that listen to your podcast. I was at Facebook for five years. Like I said, the first two years I was in HR and I was doing employment branding and culture work and I was ready to stay there. I think I had in my head I was going to stay there until we went public, that was my plan just because I wanted to help the company through that moment, again, in my head.

(00:24:21):
This guy that many people know, Chamath Palihapitiya, came to me and Chamath ran growth and mobile at the time. And he came to me and we had lunch and he said in his very Chamath way, "You're useless. What are you doing in HR? This is stupid. You should come work for me." And anybody that knows Chamath is like, "Yes, that is actually what he said." He managed to insult you and compliment you in one sentence.

(00:24:47):
He gave me all these options on his team. And then the last one he said to me was like, "I'm going to go build a mobile phone. Do you want to come do that with me?" And I had four simultaneous reactions. The first was like, " That is incredibly stupid. Why are we doing that?" And then it was like, "Is that actually a thing that we're doing?" And then it was like, "Whoa, I think that sounds kind of fun." And so I left the conversation at Chamath and I went and asked my boss, Lori Goler, who's the head of people at Facebook for a very long time, like, "Is this actually something we're doing?" And she was like, "I can't believe he offered you that, whatever."

(00:25:21):
And I basically just could not get it out of my head, but it didn't make any sense, A, that Chamath had asked me because I was in HR. Like, "What am I doing? I don't absolutely jack shit about mobile." But I had worked on a project with him and I guess he thought I was smart. And I talked to Cheryl and she was like, "Well, that project will be dead in two months, but you can do it because you'll still have a job here." My dad was like, "Well, don't do that. " And anyway, a lot of very wise people being like, "Don't do that."

(00:25:51):
But I kind of couldn't get out of my head. And my friend said to me, "You've proven you're really good at this sort of company-wide project management and HR. Why don't you go show yourself how actually good you are? Is this transferable?" So, I took the job and I spent the next six months feeling like an absolute idiot. I basically felt like a total jackass all the time. I was sitting in rooms with these brilliant people asking the dumbest questions of my life and at the end of the six months, Chamath, I think, took a lot of pride in giving me the lowest performance rating I've ever gotten in my life, and it just felt like falling off a cliff. Then, slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone and trying to explain to him why something he wanted to do was not possible. I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, "Oh, I actually know things." And slowly then, over the following three years, I became an expert in mobile. And I basically... The phone itself was a giant failure, massive, costly failure for Facebook, but it was not a failure for me. It was a huge job that taught me that I was capable of things that I never could have dreamed of if I had stayed in HR. It set me up to be capable of taking on things that I didn't know about.

(00:27:28):
Chamath, when he pitched me on this job, actually drew me a picture on a whiteboard. He said, "Look, you can stay..." The way a lot of people do careers is a set of stairs. "You can be boring." To use Chamath, "And stay on these stairs. Just walk up the stairs and you'll get promoted every two years and your title will change from manager to senior manager to director to senior director, whatever." And he was like, "But that is boring." And he's like, "The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs." Basically, that you jump off this thing and you do fall for a period of time. I always like to say it's about six to nine months, but then this thing happens where you climb out.

(00:28:05):
And the picture he drew had this J-curve sort of basically leading you to places that are way beyond where the stairs could ever get you. And to be totally honest, that has been my experience. That taking risks, accepting the sort of terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it. Part of the reason why Sarah mentions it is that I do give this sort of talk to people that are inside of really fast-growing companies, because it's such an important place to let go of Legos and jump off cliffs because there's so much opportunity. And it is a place where if you prove to people that you're actually good, if they believe that you are the kind of person that they can use to do lots of things, you can get these opportunities that you are just so deeply unqualified for, but they can take you to places that you could never have imagined.

(00:29:01):
You can come out of those companies with skills that no one would ever have reasonably hired you to do. But I ended my time at Facebook in product and did business development and hardware and a whole bunch of the stuff along the way. And again, nobody would've hired me to do that at the beginning, but it's just because I kept saying yes to things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:22):
Molly, I got tingles listening to this story. Wow.

Molly Graham (00:29:25):
Does it sound familiar, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
It does. I want to ask, jumping off a cliff, sometimes you fall, really fall and you keep falling. Are there any kind of traits of like, "Okay, this is one that might be a J-Curve and worth the risk of falling, and this is when you should probably just not, let's not do this".

Molly Graham (00:29:46):
Yeah. I just think there are different kinds of fear. We talk a lot about this in Glue Club because one of the thing, there is a financial fear, right? Leaving a job and taking a job that has financial risk associated with it, or leaving a job and taking time off, which is something that I spend a lot of time talking to people about, you got to do the math and you got to... Sometimes there is a type of fear that is telling you like, "This is not the right time." Or, "I don't want to be financially anxious for months and months and months."

(00:30:21):
I use finances because it's the most concrete example of a type of fear that you should actually listen to. And sometimes you can do the math. I always counsel people through that. I'm like, "What is the number that you need to hit so that you're not constantly terrified financially?" And that number is wildly different for people based on their background and their life. "Can you do that? Can you consult, can you whatever in order to take this leap?" But a lot of times fear is just you saying, "I'm scared I can't do this. I'm scared I'm not capable of it. Yeah, I'm scared I'll fail."

(00:30:56):
And that's the kind of fear that I think of as a flashing green light because... And it sounds like Matt McGinnis said this too, where it's like, "That's the kind of fear that's saying, 'Why don't you go prove to yourself that you are actually capable of this?'" Or if you fail, like, "You'll have learned something, too." You know what I mean? You'll have learned, like, "I took this job in product at Facebook as my last chapter there, and let me tell you things that people should never fucking hire me to do." I was like, "I am not a good product manager." But I've got a great product mindset. I can sit in a bunch of chairs and hang with the product folks, but I'm not the person that cares about the button. Do you know what I mean?

(00:31:38):
And I would never have learned that. I wouldn't have known who I was if I hadn't taken that risk and failed or at least learned that it's not something I wanted to do again. So, there's many different lessons that come from facing down those fears and jumping off the cliff, but mostly what it is is knowing yourself better and knowing where you go next from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:03):
That is such helpful advice. I also love how you frame this of, "Prove it to yourself that you can do this." It's not, "I'm going to show them that I can do this." Because the way you describe this, usually it's an opportunity given to you. "Hey, can you do this thing? We want you to lead this new thing." And the fear is like, "I don't think I can do that." And what you're saying here is, "Prove it to yourself that you can." Or, I guess, it's also, "Okay, maybe I can't and then I'll learn that and then I'll know more about myself."

Molly Graham (00:32:27):
Yeah, exactly. I mean, one of the greatest gifts in a career is knowing yourself. And that's a lifelong journey because who you are and what you want changes, but that knowledge and that gift, nothing accelerates your self-knowledge faster than trying to do something that you don't know how to do and that you're scared of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
Probably the quote I use most on this podcast comes up again in my mind as you talk about this, this line that, "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek."

Molly Graham (00:32:59):
Hell yes, exactly. Well said.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):
There it is.

Molly Graham (00:33:03):
I haven't heard that one from you, so clearly I need to listen more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:04):
Okay, that's great. I'm glad I don't overuse it. It just feels like it comes up again and again, and I think your point about the runway and the finances is such an important one because that's a very real practical question. One thing I did when I took time off, I took a year off after I left my job. What helped me was I just created a runway goal for myself. I'm just like, "Okay, here's what it's going to cost me for six months or a year to live without any income. Am I comfortable just burning through these tens of thousands of dollars to explore and see something new emerge?" And so you just have to feel good. "Okay, yes, I'm going to burn all that money and that's part of it."

Molly Graham (00:33:37):
Yeah, that's exactly the exercise. You're saying "runway" I say "burn rate", so we both were raised inside of companies, incentive tech, but I think it is do the math, right? What can you afford? And it's both what can you afford and still feel safe? Because sometimes, I mean, again, I think that is different for everyone, but it is such an important set of math to do because, A, a lot of times that number is smaller than you think it is, then your brain makes it out to be if you have this sort of existential financial anxiety versus, I always say, "Specific financial anxiety is much more useful than existential financial anxiety." And some friends are leaving jobs and I'll be like, "Hey, your number is 5K or 10K a month. You have to believe that you can get a consulting gig that will pay you that. Do you believe that?" And it's like, "Either yes or no." And then, "Okay, either we're doing it or we're not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
The other part of this J- Curve that I think is really important to touch on is this idea of for the first six or nine months, you're going to be at the bottom of the J curve falling, still falling. And some projects don't last that long and then you're like, "Okay, total failure. I never emerged from this fall." So, is there any advice there? Just, how do you create that enough space to give you a chance to start to un-fall?

Molly Graham (00:34:49):
I mean, the most valuable thing that happens as you fall is learning. And even on the other side of failure, you've learned a shit ton. I always say, "The most important thing to do in the falling phase and the risk taking land is to learn to embrace being a professional idiot." Basically, being the one that shows up at the meeting and is like, "What are we talking about? What does that word mean?"

(00:35:18):
For a bunch of reasons. Number one, you can learn so much. And again, even in the face of failure, no one can take away your learning. Do you know what I mean? But the other thing is that it turns out that a lot of the questions in the world that, you're sitting in the meeting and you're like, "This is a dumb question. Everyone's going to think I'm an idiot." But then you get brave and you ask it and it turns out it wasn't a dumb question. Do you know what I mean? Turns out that everyone had that question in their mind, but no one was brave enough to ask it.

(00:35:48):
So, from a skills' perspective, again, regardless of outcome, being the person that sort of takes their learning in their own hands, learning no matter what and learning to ask those dumb questions, it's a superpower. I always say that, "Actually, my superpower is being a professional moron." Because I'm the one that shows up in a room and is like, "Do we have goals? What are we doing? Why are we talking about this? Why are we having this meeting?" And most of the time it's actually what I was hired to do, which is bring clarity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):
It's so funny. I just recorded a podcast episode with a PM named Zevi who joined Wix and he had this thought, he's like a very young PM, just getting started and he's like, "Okay, I need to be a 10X PM because that's what they expect of me, that's what everyone that is really good, that's how I think of a 10X PM." And then he went into his first meeting and he just failed and he just felt so bad. He's like, "I guess I'm not that 10X PM. They're all going to see that. They think I'm terrible." And then he did another presentation a little bit later and people were so impressed with how he learned and evolved and improved. And he realized that he needs to be not a 10X PM, but a 10X learner, and that's what people actually expect from someone, especially a junior person.

Molly Graham (00:37:05):
Yeah. Well, I was having a conversation last night with a friend of mine who has a senior in high school and I was like, "What is the plan? What are we telling this senior in high school to think about relative to their career given everything that's going on with AI?" And we talked about it a bunch, but what we both circled back to was this idea of soft skills and that actually the only thing you can really anchor on right now is that teaching kids grit, teaching them hard work, teaching them learning, right? Learning how to learn, loving learning, being able to fall, in a world that's changing this fast. And I say this inside of companies too, right? I always say, like, "What you know today is way less valuable than what you can learn by tomorrow." If you're inside of a company where the growth curve is like this, what you know today is irrelevant.

(00:37:52):
Somebody once told... I'm sure this is faster now, but they rewrote the entire code base at Google every eight years, which means that if you're not learning, if you're not evolving, then you become irrelevant and extinct. It's actually the whole underlying point of the Legos stuff is that evolution is the way you stay on top, and I think that's more true today than it's ever been.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:14):
And luckily, AI is really good at helping us learn.

Molly Graham (00:38:16):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:17):
So, that's good. Thank you, AI. And this actually comes up a bunch in the podcast. I ask a lot of AI-forward people what they're teaching their kids and curiosity is one of the main things people talk a lot about. Just like, "Help them develop curiosity about the world."

Molly Graham (00:38:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:31):
Yeah. Okay. I feel like I could be talking about this specific topic for a whole podcast episode, but I want to move on to a couple other frameworks that you've developed. One is something called a Waterline Model and another former colleague of here said, "This is the most impactful thing that they've learned from you on their career." So, talk about the Waterline Model.

Molly Graham (00:38:50):
Okay. Yeah. Well, first of all, the Waterline Model is not mine. It's from some business book somewhere, but I actually learned it. My first job out of college was leading wilderness trips. I led 75-day wilderness trips in Patagonia and Alaska for a school called NOLS, the National Outdoor Leadership School. NOLS basically teaches essentially leadership and communication skills to students.

(00:39:15):
I was mostly leading college age kids through wilderness expeditions. So, by having to lead a group of your peers that you don't know. Anyway, the Waterline Model is something that we taught on NOLS. It's a really, really helpful model for understanding how to diagnose when something is not working on a team, so I teach it inside of Glue Club and I'll just quickly explain it. Basically, the way to think about the Waterline Model is that a team is a boat and it's a boat on an ocean trying to get somewhere, getting somewhere is goals, right? "What are we trying to build or ship or do?" Essentially, that is going to be harder or easier based on whatever the shape of the ocean is, right? If it's really choppy, it's harder, if it's smooth and calm, it's going to be easy to get to your goals.

(00:40:02):
So, the Waterline basically asks the question like, "What is going on under the water? What is going on that's making it harder or easier to get to your goals?" And there's essentially four things underneath the water and they are in a descending order. The surface level is what's called structural things. Basically, structural things are like goal setting, vision, roles, expectations, kind of the structures you put in place to make a team and a company and a business make sense, that touch every single member of the team.

(00:40:37):
Right below that is something called dynamics, which is essentially how the team works together. It's culture, it's decision making, it's how we resolve conflict, all the sort of like interwoven pieces of how teams work together. And then below that is interpersonal, so basically relationships between two people and all the things that come with us being humans. And then the bottom is intrapersonal, meaning within one person, challenges and issues there.

(00:41:08):
The interesting thing about this model is that most people, when something's going wrong on a team, a lot of times we always go to the bottom. We go to the people. We're like, "The people aren't getting along, that person's having a rough moment." We go to the humans, but the rule with the Waterline Model, which is very memorable, is you snorkel before you scuba. So, 80% of problems on teams actually happen because of structural issues or dynamics issues. So, when there are problems on your team, where you start is at the top, you start structural issues.

(00:41:44):
And one of my biggest things that I say all the time over and over again inside of Glue Club is, "Your only goal as a manager, if you do nothing else, is clear roles and clear expectations. That's it." Because honestly, I've taken over a lot of teams in my life and almost always I show up and it turns out that no one knows what their job is and no one knows what success looks like. And if you can make those two things clear, which again is at the snorkel level, it will fix a huge percentage of other issues on a team. But the main thing is where you start and just always sort of starting at that structural level or the dynamics level and not sort of immediately going to the people and all that. Because yes, people cause all sorts of problems, but a lot of times the problems are happening because they're existing inside of a structure that's confusing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:32):
Another very vivid metaphor and just, I love how it builds on it with the snorkeling. Okay. So, just to be super clear about this, the takeaway here is, you have a problem with your team, with the company, many people think it's, they jump to the people are the problem. "They're not good enough, they're not working hard enough." Really, what you're saying is, most often, the issue is not the person, it's the situation, whether it's the structure of how they're set up to work or the dynamics amongst the people. And specifically what you're saying is that the role maybe isn't clear or what success means for that role is not clear.

Molly Graham (00:43:08):
Every company I've worked with or advise, I often start with like, "What are the goals?" And usually what you get the hack is, "Uh, not clear." And that in and of itself is a structural issue, right? How can someone show up and decide what they're going to do with their day all day if the goals aren't clear, if they don't actually know what the priorities are? And then it goes to, okay, role, right? "Do I know what my job is? Do I know what number I was hired to own and drive?" And then, "Do I know what success looks like? How does my role tie to that overall goal that the company has?" Just literally right there. You got probably 80% of problems inside of companies because this is the hard work of company building. It's the stuff that's not intuitive. "How do you organize a group of people to know which direction to row?"

(00:43:52):
And that equation, again, I would say 80% of problems that I see, performance issues. I always start with, "Does this person actually know what you expect of them?" If not, go back to step one. Do you know what I mean? Clarify expectations, so the Waterline Model is just helpful for reminding us, like, "Start at the top."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):
So what would you do there? Say you're a manager, you're having an issue with a team member, would you go and ask, "Hey, let's just make sure we're aligned on goals and roles." Is that how'd you approach it or is there a different approach?

Molly Graham (00:44:24):
So a lot of times what I do is two-sided, right? So it's like, "Hey, here's what I'm seeing and tell me what's going on for you. Do you know X, Y, Z?" When I take over a team, when I'm doing my listening tour, part of what I'm asking is, "What do you think your job is? What number were you hired to drive?" Because what you'll find is often their picture is different than your picture. You think you've been clear, you described an elephant and they spat out a tiger and that coming back to like, "Okay, no, we're building an elephant. You're in charge of the trunk." Will, in some percentage of cases, actually make a huge difference to the person's work and time and performance. In plenty of cases it doesn't, but that's always where I would start because it so often is just a more fundamental problem that then would lead you to look at other things across the team.

(00:45:20):
But yeah, I would say two-way dialogue, but re-clarifying roles and expectations, re-describing the elephant over and over and over again, is one of the hardest parts about being a leader because you feel like a broken record, right? You feel like an idiot. You're like, "I've said this 45 times." Turns out no one heard you the first 43 and you have to. You have to re-describe it in order for people to hear you and to re-understand their sort of role in what they're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):
I love how you reframed the way I approached it by starting with, "Here's what I'm seeing. What are you seeing? What do you think your role is? " The very non-violent communication oriented, which is a clear pattern on this podcast, just the power of that specific framework.

Molly Graham (00:45:58):
Yeah, totally. Well, like I said, work is about humans and it's...

Molly Graham (00:46:01):
Like I said, work is about humans and it's the art of organizing humans to get something done and build something that's greater than the sum of its parts and that is an art of the humanness in all of us, how do we get people to hear us, how do we get people aligned.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:17):
Work for a lifetime.

Molly Graham (00:46:19):
Totally.

(00:47:17):
Okay, so let me actually follow this thread of the importance of goals and just being clear around this stuff. You have these six rules for creating clear goals and alignment on teams, talk about these six roles.

Molly Graham (00:47:30):
Yeah, totally. I feel like there should be less than six but it's where we're at. I would say, at a high level, two things before I get to the six. One is that I definitely have a bone to pick with OKRs, I feel like it's obviously been a really helpful framework for Google and others and, a lot of times, when I show up inside a company or I'm talking to a leader and I'm like, "What are your goals?" what I get back is this spreadsheet that has 100 lines and feels like it's written in Greek and, when I look at it, I'm like, " This doesn't create clarity for anyone." And it brings me back to what is the point of goals, why do we have them and, at the end of the day, goals are a communication tool, that's what they are. They're a communication tool designed to create clarity, to help people know I'm going to show up at my desk, what should I work on, what's the most important thing and your 100-line spreadsheet doesn't help anybody.

(00:48:23):
And the second thing I would just say is you really have to ask the question what is right for me at this company and this stage, what is right for a seed stage company is not what is right for a company that's got an established business and a clear go-to-market machine. So, when I'm building in seed stage, I'm setting goals every two months in a very iterative way. When I have an established business, I can actually set annual goals but annual goals for early stage companies is just a waste of time. So, anyway, a lot of my goal setting stuff actually comes from Facebook which I think was very, very good at this.

(00:48:58):
So, the first role is that no company needs more than three company goals and the point of company goals is to help people know what the most important things are to success. So, Facebook basically had three goals for the entire time I was there, it was five years and we did six-month goal setting, I think we did annual goal setting that ended up getting reset every six months but whatever. So, the three goals were this, there was growth which was measured as monthly active users, that was the externally reported number eventually, MAUs. The second goal was engagement meaning how often do people come back and use the site and the third was revenue and we literally had three goals for the five years that I was there. If you can govern that business with three goals, you can govern literally any business with three goals. So, no company needs more than three goals.

(00:49:52):
The second thing is that one goal needs to win in a fight. So, if I'm sitting down and asking how do I prioritize my time on a given day I need to know what is the most important thing. At Facebook, we had growth and there's a lot of different ways you can add monthly active users to a social media site including you can go buy a whole bunch of bots in Indonesia and that would add to your MAU number but it would not add to your engagement number and it was very clear for the entire time that I was there that engagement was the most important thing. Acquiring users that were going to use the site all the time, that's what drives revenue, it's also what drove the heart of that site. So, if you had to prioritize something, you prioritized engagement, that goal won in the fight.

(00:50:35):
The third I'll say is, I call it the explain it to me like I'm five goal, but an intern that started on Monday should be able to look at your goals and understand them and, if they can't, then you are failing because they are not a communication tool that's effective. You have to be able to understand the goals, you have to explain the acronyms, you have to have numbers that make sense to average people, otherwise, again, it fails as a communication tool.

(00:51:03):
The fourth one is ... Actually, I stole a phrase from Claire Hughes Johnson who you've had on your podcast but wrote a book called Scaling People and in it she says this sentence that I love which is strategy should hurt. And my role used to be set non-goals, basically, make it as clear what you're not going to do as what you are going to do but strategy should hurt is a much better way to explain it to people which is, if you're not making trade-offs that are painful, you are not actually helping people prioritize their time. Because the nature of work is that people will show up every day and do something and either you are very clear with them about what the priorities are or they're going to prioritize for you because they're going to choose what they work on every day. And we see this so much with founders where they can't cut things off the list, they just have to have the 10 goals and I'm like, "Cool. Six of these goals are not going to get done so either you pick which four it is or other people are going to pick for you." So, strategy should hurt. If your goal setting process is not painful, then you're not prioritizing heavily enough.

(00:52:09):
Okay, ready? We're on number five. This is more of an organizational point but it's really important for the waterline model too which is that one goal has one owner. You have a number, that number has a name next to it. If you cannot do that work, you haven't done the most important work to actually make sure that these goals get accomplished. And it's organizational work and it's very painful because sometimes it feels like, oh, this person can own it or this, maybe they'll just own it together, two people owning a goal is no one owning a goal. One person owns the goal, who is it? It's not you as the CEO, it's someone that works for you so one goal, one owner. And then the last, which is the hardest, is that goals by themselves are not enough. I've spent a lot of time with founders that are like, "I did it. I set the goals. Why not working? I don't understand." And I'm like, "What did you do after you set the goals?" And they're like, "I don't know, I set the goals." Goals ...

(00:53:10):
James Clear who wrote Atomic Habits has this really lovely sentence which is winners and losers have the same goal. Goals by themself are not enough, you have to have a process by which you follow up on the goals and you hold people accountable to the goals and you learn from the goals because so much of goal setting, particularly if you're earlier in building your company, is about learning from trying to do something. You set a goal, can we do it, how hard is it to move this number, that is the ... You might be wrong all the time but you're learning what it takes to move the number. So, setting the goal by itself, not enough, you have to build a process in the system to actually learn from the goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:53):
Wow. This list is ... There's so much power in this list, it's such a succinct-

Molly Graham (00:53:57):
It's too long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:58):
No, I don't think it is because each of these has so much depth and power to them that saves you so much headache and just wasted time and resources. Just the idea of one owner, one goal, something I've personally discovered to have such power because, and correct me if I'm missing something here but just, if you feel like someone else may be doing the thing or feels like it's not just fully your responsibility, there's so much less energy and just mental ... I don't know. You just don't care as much about hitting that goal. And if it's you-

Molly Graham (00:54:29):
Yeah, accountability.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:30):
Yeah. If it's like, "Lenny, this goal is your goal and, if you hit it, you've done it. If you don't, you've done a bad job," that'd be a such motivating, so motivating. If it's me and Molly, okay, well, we'll figure it out.

Molly Graham (00:54:41):
It creates a flood of clarity that seeps down from the person too. And to go back to the waterline model, I would say, so often you'll actually find companies that have set goals but no one owns the goals, everyone owns the goals, multiple people own the goal and you didn't actually get all the way to the answer. And I will say that the ownership thing is hard, it can feel painful but it's really important. There's only one owner and that means that that person, come hell or high water, owns that number.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:16):
Yeah. The way I described it [inaudible 00:55:18] was just someone's ass has to be on the line for this and that just works. That's such a powerful lever to drive things to have one person responsible.

Molly Graham (00:55:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:29):
The other's just this idea of strategy hurting, I love that. I love that phrase, I forgot Claire had that. So true.

Molly Graham (00:55:36):
So good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:37):
Because the whole idea is you need to not do things, you need to decide what you're not ... The whole strategy, a big part of it is what we are not doing.

Molly Graham (00:55:44):
Yeah, absolutely. And if you're not making painful choices, then you're not actually doing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):
And this idea of three goals, so is it just ... So, do you go into a company and just go through a checklist essentially of here's the six things I look at to tell me where there's opportunity to improve?

Molly Graham (00:55:58):
When I work with founders and I see their goals, I use it as a way to get to know the business and I'm just going to be literally like, "What is this? What are you trying to explain?" And I can usually, through asking a lot of really dumb questions which, like I said, one of my superpowers, get them to explain to me the one sentence and the one number that they're actually trying to get across but it takes work and that's part of ... It's almost easier to write the 100-line spreadsheet than it is to say, "Wait, what are the three drivers of this business genuinely? What are they and how do they relate to each other?" And there can be things underneath them but there's three at the top that matter. So, yeah, I'm not a scientific person about it but a lot of it is just by asking people to explain their businesses to me, you can basically find the drivers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):
And the story about Facebook having these same three goals for five years, considering their success, you may think they're not as complicated as your business but I am confident they're just as, if not, more complicated. They're a marketplace, a social network, they're a ad business, just they're ... There's a lot going on and, if they can work with three goals, you can do that too. And to your point, if it's not hurting, then you're doing something wrong.

Molly Graham (00:57:17):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:18):
I love how ... This is very much what I wanted this chat to be. It feels like every little segment is its own, could be its own podcast where we could talk about this for hours so I'm really excited how this is going. Moving on to another topic, you have not necessarily rules but rules of thumb that you find really helpful for people to have in their head as they're dealing with change and scale and growth and all that kind of stuff so let's just walk through that.

Molly Graham (00:57:45):
Yeah. So, for leaders that are leading through change and growth, the list is probably long but I always say to people don't come to me for management 101, I'm not the person to ask on how to run the most effective one-on-one with your people. What I think is not talked about enough is what it takes to manage and lead through change and that is a very particular set of feelings. And the first thing I learned, when someone makes you a manager or when you take a job as a leader inside a company, you really do feel like, "Oh, who gave me this job?" and you feel like you're supposed to know the answer to things. People come to you and ask questions and you're like, "I'm supposed to know. I'm a leader, I am supposed to have answers."

(00:58:35):
And I think, particularly inside of rapid change and scale and growth, it's really important to understand that your job as manager and a leader is not to have all the answers. It is not to have all the answers, it is to get good at finding them, it is to get good at bringing people together to find the answers. And that is hard because it requires saying, "I don't know, let's go figure it out," a whole bunch and it's scary as a leader to say I don't know because you think, "Oh, gosh, people are going to see through me." But again, the more you travel in life, the more you realize that the most experienced leaders are the ones that say, "No, no, no," all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:13):
I think this is a good reminder of this Bob the monster concept because, hearing this, okay, I don't need to have all the answers as a leader. In real life, being in a meeting, people are like, "Hey, Molly, what do you think of this?" You're like, "Oh, I should have a good answer." And so, I think that's a good reminder of this idea of this Bob the monster is going to tell you, "Oh, you don't know anything, you're not ready for this. You suck at this, you're going to fail everyone that's [inaudible 00:59:34]."

Molly Graham (00:59:33):
They're regretting hiring you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:35):
Yeah, exactly.

Molly Graham (00:59:36):
Everyone's going to see through you. Imposter, imposter, imposter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):
Yeah, yeah.

Molly Graham (00:59:39):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):
But just remembering, there's going to be this part of your head and that's okay, it's there but it doesn't mean it's true.

Molly Graham (00:59:44):
Absolutely. And these things are muscles. Dealing with Bob as a muscle, learning to not react to all those things that attack you but also learning, oh, in this moment when someone asks me a question and I'm like, "Oh," actually I should be like, "I don't actually know, let's go ... Who should we ask? How can we learn this? How can we explore this together? What do you think?" Those are all actually very powerful questions and they're terrifying to, particularly earlier in your career, as a leader and a manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:11):
Awesome. So, yeah, so the lesson there is no one expects you to have all the answers as a leader.

Molly Graham (01:00:15):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Awesome.

Molly Graham (01:00:17):
And particularly in this world, the one that's changing as fast as it is, nobody knows. Nobody knows what the answers are in a lot of cases, the war will be won by the people that are good exploring and figuring it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:29):
I love that phrase.

Molly Graham (01:00:31):
So, the second one is, and everyone that has learned this has learned it the hard way, do not promise things that you can't control. It's so tempting particularly when you're hiring people to be like, "Oh, yeah, your onboarding will be smooth and calm and everything's clear and we've figured it ... Let us tell you our vision and how obvious and clear and smart and blah, blah, blah." And then they show up and it's like, "Oh, shit," you know what I mean? There's no manual, no one knows what they're doing, it's all ambiguity and chaos. It's so easy when someone says I want to know that I'm going to be your CMO forever to be like, "Sure, you can be my CMO," you don't know that. Do you know what I mean? So, being really careful with promises of things that are out of your control like stability or titles or never hiring over someone is a flashing red light because there is literally no faster way to demoralize high performers than going back on a promise. Everyone that has been through it knows that feeling of like, "They told me this when I joined," and then they don't do it and you're like, "Well, fuck this place." So, no faster way to demoralize people or to hire the wrong people than promising things that are actually out of your control. Being honest and upfront about who you are as a company, about what you're able to promise, all of that is actually ... It's very hard work but it's so important because so much is out of your control and you need to hire people that are cool with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):
Love that. I learned this the hard way once, I had a ... One of my early projects, we were late and the head of product was just so pissed he's like, "Because I've been telling the CEO it's going to be on time because you've been telling me it's going to be on time and then it wasn't and why didn't you tell me that?" And I was just like, "Okay, it'll never happen again," and he's like, "You can't ... Don't tell me that because that's not true, that nay not ... You can't guarantee that." And so, that taught me that lesson of just, yeah, you're right, you want to say that, it feels so good. Okay, this will never happen again but you can't and they know you can't promise things like that.

Molly Graham (01:02:38):
Yeah. And sorry, I'm going to quote Claire Hughes Johnson again but she has this really fun phrase that she said in a talk at Glue Club that I've now latched onto and stolen from her which is, she was like, "Promises like that are like letter bombs that you mail yourself that are going to explode in your face in a year," and I was like, "That is the perfect metaphor." Because it's short-term pain, you want to make this person feel good right now so you promise them something but, in one year, you're going to make them feel terrible so don't do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):
Great advice. All right, keep going.

Molly Graham (01:03:11):
Yeah. So, again, could probably go on the topic of what it takes to manage and lead forever inside this stuff but I'll give you two more that I yell about a lot in Glue Club. The first is that we spend huge amounts of time talking about hiring. How do you get good at hiring? What's the right interview? How do I find the right people? Firing people is as important as hiring people. Getting good at identifying when someone does not belong or someone is not going to work out is actually a skill and being good at it as a company and as a leader is as important as identifying the right talent because, eventually, if you're not good at firing people, what you have is essentially barnacles on a ship. Really going forward with the ship metaphor, anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:12):
It's true.

Molly Graham (01:04:00):
It's drag people that are sitting around not pushing the team forward. So, it's painful and it's horrible because it is humans but, when someone doesn't fit, you ... No one is right all the time when it comes to hiring, I actually say most people are wrong half the time. The best people in the world in hiring will tell you they have about a 50% average in terms of being right. That means half the hires don't work out. That means, half the time, you're going to need to fire the person. So, it's such an important skill to get good at particularly when you're going through a lot of change. And the last one is humans are messy and it's very emotional. And when you're a leader, particularly if you have any kind of anagram too or just if you like to make people happy and you want to be liked, it can be so hard to lead teams because you get tangled in the people. Firing people is a painful experience, reorganizing things, layering people, all these things are emotionally painful for the people and they're emotionally painful for you as a manager.

(01:05:05):
But my mantra that almost always leads in the best direction is serve the business, not the people meaning everyone is better off if this company is wildly successful. Everyone looks smart and makes lots of money or whatever if this company grows and does what we all dream it can. So, at the end of the day, the best decisions, the ones that are always going to be right are the ones that are like, "How do we do the right thing for this business?" And it also helps in political situations. Someone's acting weird or their Bob is raging all over the company, technically, everyone has the same goal. The goal is to build the biggest business possible, that's the answer. The answer is always what's the right thing for the business. And the people stuff can fall away when you actually focus on what's the right thing for the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:55):
A really useful tool to do that that I learned from my manager is to think about, when you're trying to decide whether to fire someone or change a project even though it's going to upset someone, is to say, "Okay, if there were no emotions involved, if this person had no negative reaction to this, what would I do?"

Molly Graham (01:06:15):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:16):
And then that's the thing you should do and then you just do it. And then the question is how do I communicate this to them where their pain is lowest essentially.

Molly Graham (01:06:16):
In the kindest way possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):
In the kindest way possible. And because, to your point, if you optimize for the other thing of making people feel good, everything just falls apart, they're going to suffer even more down the road.

Molly Graham (01:06:38):
Yeah, absolutely. Direct is kind. And it feels kind or, really, honestly, easy to avoid these things or to work around them or to not but, at the end of the day, it's basically just a drag, the barnacle thing. It drags on your company, on your time, on your energy, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:58):
Yeah. But again, very hard to do in real life to do the thing that's hard and cause someone to be sad and upset and frustrated and maybe leave.

Molly Graham (01:07:08):
It is so hard and all these things are muscles, you get better at ... They don't become easy, it's not like anybody who's like, "Oh, it's so ... I enjoy firing people," no, but you recognize it faster and you are like, "Oh, I need to go do this." And that is actually ... It's a practice and something that you need to practice to become the kind of leader that leads these long-enduring companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:32):
Yeah. And this tool of thinking, asking what would I do if there were no emotions involved and this person wouldn't be upset, it helps you realize, okay, I see, this actually doesn't make sense to just do it the easy way right now because it doesn't make sense.

Molly Graham (01:07:46):
Yeah, it strips away. It strips away the emotions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:50):
Something else I wanted to make sure we spent a little time on is you have another tidbit along these lines which is around putting most of your energy into high performers versus spending all your time people that need help, talk about that.

Molly Graham (01:08:02):
As a leader, as a manager, you're running these teams and someone's struggling and it's very easy to get dragged into that and to end up spending a huge amount of energy on it but high performers are actually the future of your company. And if you think about it and if you've spent time on it, those are the folks where, if you invest your time and energy in them, you're going to get the 10x return that people talk about all the time in Silicon Valley. But what I've witnessed is that most people have a high performer and they just leave them alone, they're like, "That person's doing well so I'm just going to let them do their thing." And what I do when I have a high performer that's my favorite thing in the world is invest time and energy in them and basically build a whole system of working with them that is designed to draw out potential. And I would say there's two things here, one is it's really important to realize that our tendency-

Molly Graham (01:09:00):
There's two things here. One is it's really important to realize that our tendency is to actually spend time on low performers and it is not a good use of your time. See the point about firing people. But the other thing is that actively investing in and developing high performers is something that's important to get good at as a leader because that is how you create these little rocket ships that end up... You'll manage someone who's just like a project manager and all of a sudden they're running a whole function inside the company eventually, but it's because you took time and energy to invest in them. And my basic way of doing that, not to... I could spend a long time on this, but I would just say is I run experiments. I basically develop a theory about someone, "I think this person is capable of this kind of thing." And then piece by piece, it doesn't have to be a whole job or whole project. It can just be an incremental experiment, "I'm going to see if they can do this with less guidance or support from me."

(01:09:52):
I'm going to give them a bigger project. I'm going to give them something with more visibility. I'm going to manage them less, oversee them less, whatever. All of those are experiments to basically test your theory and deepen your theory in terms of this person's potential and their ability to help the company. And you're basically, for me, what I'm doing is deeply getting to know that person and then trying to pair them with company needs. What do we need? This person is great at zebra farming. Where do we need zebra farming? So how do I get them working on bigger and bigger and more and more critical things?

(01:10:27):
And to be honest, this is what people have done for me. At Facebook in particular, I've benefited from people being like, "Ooh, come help me with this thing." They saw potential in me and they asked me to help with something and it unlocked a huge amount for me. And so, it is such a powerful tool for getting more out of people that might be a little bit stuck if you leave them in this box. But if you start to expand the box, you can really unlock people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
So speaking of high performers, you've worked with many very high performing founder-CEOs. He worked really closely with Zuck, with Cheryl Sandberg, with Larry and Sergei at Google, with Brett Taylor, who I just... Just like you trying to read his resume, it takes three lines of things he's done over the course of his career. And so I just want to spend a little time on what are some things you've learned, maybe a few things you've learned from them, that group that you find yourself sharing with other people most.

Molly Graham (01:11:26):
That list is very long, but I'll give you a couple. The first one that I think is kind of counterintuitive is... So I said I worked at Facebook. I worked on culture, which is one of those words that doesn't really mean anything. So I define it as the way we do things around here. And I thought my job was to shape the culture. I thought it was to push the culture. And the most humbling lesson I learned is 80% of the culture of a company is literally defined by the personality of the founder. Facebook is Mark. Google is Larry and Sergei. Google, when I was there, it felt like a university. It's where ideas are more important in a lot of ways than what's shipped. And there's a campus and they basically wanted people to live there when I was there. It was designed to basically be a two PhD students' paradise.

(01:12:29):
Facebook felt like a 19-year-old hacker's dorm room when I was there. And it was shipping above all and all else. And it seeped with Mark's DNA. And I spent ages trying to create various changes inside the company or trying to push a point. And Mark would say literally one thing in an all hands, and it was like somebody threw a boulder into the pond. So our job as operators or as leaders around founders is to help articulate the culture that they're creating and to help extend it. My version of founder mode, which I know you've spent some time on on this podcast is your job is to build a company that would make a decision the way the founder would when they're not in the room. That is the work of building a company around a founder, but your job is not to shape culture.

(01:13:24):
That is mostly defined by the literal personality strengths and weaknesses of the person at the top. And that's been true of Mark and it's been true of Brett. Everywhere I go, that's who it is. You don't need a consulting firm to tell you, just go do a personality diagnosis on your founder. And the weaknesses thing is real. I've seen and watched friends try to shape a set of values at a company and it just doesn't match who the founder is. You say, "Move fast and break things," or whatever your version of that is. And your founder loves ambiguity and is perfectly happy with not making decisions. All that leads to is cultural dissonance. It leads to people being like, "Wait, what? I thought we said we care about moving fast and making aggressive decisions and it turns out..." So being really careful about what you say, because what people actually feel when it comes to culture is what you do and how you act every day.

(01:14:18):
You can never write anything down and you will still have a culture. It will be created through the actions and the decisions that you make and that your founder makes. So that would be a huge one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):
Let me spend a little more time on this because this is so good. So all this advice on culture and it feels so true based on everything I've seen. So tip one there is just you can't really change the culture. Maybe there's a little bit on the edges you could adjust. It will come down and trickle down from the founder, CEO probably mostly, but just the founders in general.

Molly Graham (01:14:49):
And founder-CEO is probably the single biggest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):
Founder-CEO.

Molly Graham (01:14:52):
Co-founders, it depends a lot on the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:56):
Awesome.

Molly Graham (01:14:57):
I think Stripe is probably very much like Patrick and John, but it's not every co-founder that has that level of power [inaudible 01:15:03].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:03):
Awesome. And then the way you describe culture, I think it's the way Seth Godin talks about it too, who's also been on the podcast. How cool is that?

Molly Graham (01:15:09):
So cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:10):
He said, "Culture is..." And what you said, "Culture is the way we do things around here. That's what culture is, is how we..." That's how people describe your culture is, "The way we do things around here."

Molly Graham (01:15:22):
I ran culture, whatever the hell that means, at Facebook for a hot second. I literally haven't done a values exercise since. And it sounds crazy, right? Because in theory, I know how to do this stuff. I don't really know how to do this stuff. But for me, the point is process and systems and how do we make decisions? That's where culture actually lives. It is what you do. It's how you hire. It's how you fire. It's who you don't hire. It's all of those decisions. That is culture. So whenever I'm working with a company or building a company, that's what I'm focused on, not on what's the shiny word that we're putting on the wall. You know what I mean?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):
Yeah. So the way you're describing is, as you said, it's what you do. It's not what you say?

Molly Graham (01:15:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:59):
Awesome. Keep going.

Molly Graham (01:16:04):
I'll give you two more that are helpful. This one is a Mark Zuckerberg classic, but he has this very strong feeling that people don't escalate enough. And he was very adamant about it at Facebook. And he brought it to CZI too where he was like, "Escalation is a tool." And he's like, "People get stuck. They get stuck with two people with equal power trying to solve a problem. You can spend so much time bashing heads, going back and forth. And actually what you just need to do is go up. You need to go." The problem is that we think of escalation as, "I'm A and B and I are disagreeing. And so, I'm going to go up to C and tell on B. I'm going to go tattle to the teacher." That is not what escalation is. What escalation is, "We disagree. Neither one of us has enough power to make this decision. Let's go to someone who does." My boss, my boss's boss, whoever it is.

(01:16:59):
As soon as you are stuck, escalate. Go together, go make your case to whoever it is, go together up. That is unlocking. It's saving you a whole bunch of time. And it's something that I've found as I've worked with companies and leaders in Glue Club. It's not a muscle that's very comfortable for people, but it's so smart. And Mark has a lot of these, but that one I really took away because again, I think so many people think of escalation as bad, a failure, like, "I failed, so I had to escalate." No, it's a tool. It's what management is for. They're there to unblock you. Let them unblock you. Stop arguing over something you can't decide.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:36):
And they'll be so happy knowing you did not waste a week debating this and then just arguing and just looking at data. It's like, "Okay, I can just tell you exactly what we should do. Let's go do that."

Molly Graham (01:17:44):
Exactly. You lack context or you lack power. And then the last one actually is from Cheryl Sandberg, who I learned an enormous amount from, huge, was like going to business school without going to business school working with her. But I say it a lot right now, so I'm going to say it on your podcast so maybe some people will hear me. Growing more than 100% every year is a bad idea. The happiest growth rate is 50%, 100% is manageable. Anything more than doubling and you are signing yourself up for a world of pain. And I have seen this over and over and over again. I had to scream way louder about it five years ago than I do now because we've been through collectively a lot of pain and a lot of layoffs. And obviously the combination of 2021 and then AI has led us to talk about unit economics and scaling with tools, not people.

(01:18:47):
But I still see companies and I'm still talking to founders that are like, "Yeah, we're 50 people and we're going to be 150 people next year." And I'm like, "Could you possibly do that with 100 people?" But here's what basically happens if you grow at more than 100%, which is you're growing too fast to de-dupe all the issues. So somebody posts this role, it actually turns out that that role is also being hired for on this other team. So you're hiring two people who more or less have the same job description and are assigned to the same number or the same problem, but nobody talked to each other. And those two people both show up and they're like, "I am doing this." And the person's like, "Wait, I thought I was doing that." Anyway, so then you've got all this... And think about all the time and all the energy and all the money that goes into de-duping that.

(01:19:32):
If you slow down, if you hire for quality and for real need versus the panic hiring, whatever your sales model spits out or whatever, you'll actually find leverage. You find, "Oh, I didn't need that person," or, "I didn't need this whole team," or, "I didn't need this whole function," or, "I can wait for that." So slow down. And again, these are all just guidelines in terms of the 50% is happy and 100% is manageable. But having seen enough of this, I can tell you these are good rules and you should pay attention to them. And sometimes you're like, "I have to double or I have to more than double or I have to triple," or whatever. I'm like, "Okay, just ask a whole lot of questions as you open roles. Ask a whole lot of questions as you hire because you will find duplication, you will find chaos coming in the front door."

(01:20:16):
More people does not actually make you faster. Do you know what I mean? We think it does. It does not. It makes it harder. It makes it harder to get work done. It makes it slower. So you should be scared of adding people, not like, "Oh, this is the answer to all my problems."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):
Amazing. And just to be clear, you're talking about the growth of the company. So doubling in a year, bad idea. It's possible, but you're saying it's going to be very hard and painful and probably a really bad idea.

Molly Graham (01:20:40):
Yeah. More than doubling head count growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:40):
More than doubling.

Molly Graham (01:20:40):
Great point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:40):
Head count?

Molly Graham (01:20:42):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:43):
Awesome. It's-

Molly Graham (01:20:44):
Please feel free to do whatever you want with your business.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:47):
Just advice. This is top of mind because I just had the interview with Matt McGinnis, but so much of what he talked about is this resonates with what you're talking about. He talked a lot about under-resourcing your team-

Molly Graham (01:20:59):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:59):
Leads to much better outcomes because people don't work on the low priority stuff. They focus on only high priority stuff. And the other is this idea of escalating. He talked a lot about that. Just like, "Escalation is good. Tell me when there's something I can help with, please. I'm here waiting constantly-

Molly Graham (01:21:14):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:14):
"To help."

Molly Graham (01:21:14):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):
Amazing. So maybe for a final question, one of your former colleagues, Eric Antonow, who's just this epic dude that few people know about-

Molly Graham (01:21:16):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:24):
That I've chatted with over the last few months because he knows so many people that come on this podcast. He's a former Facebook person, now at OpenAI. I asked him what I should ask you about and he told me something really insightful about you. He said that you had this really massive growth spurt at Facebook, which you shared and talked about. And then after you leaving, you had this huge ambition to become COO, CEO, become this huge big deal boss person, just take over the world. And then he noticed your ambitions significantly pivot to working on community building and helping people with their careers. And you turned down really big C-level role opportunities. And the way he described it is you were a dog that once thought you were cat. And the other metaphor he used is you change from AC current to DC current, which I don't know exactly what that means. So does this resonate? And if so, just what happened there?

Molly Graham (01:22:22):
Eric is actually better at metaphors than I am, and I regularly rip his metaphors. But yes, Eric Antonow, the least well-known, but most brilliant person in my life. So I gave a talk at a company recently and somebody asked the question, "What's something you've changed your mind about?" And I was like, "Woof." But I actually talked about this because... So my brain is developing this model that is not done yet, but it's basically this idea that everybody has a proving phase to their career where you're proving to yourself and probably to your parents and some other people that you're good at stuff. You're like, "I'm going to prove." And it's an important phase because you need to learn. All the stuff we talked about. You need to learn what you're good at. You need to learn that you are good at things and that people should hire you for things and what are those things?

(01:23:22):
But part of that phase is also doing what you think matters, what you think you should do. Family programming or career books tell you this is what you should do, titles and all that stuff. And then, I think everybody has a moment and I think this moment varies wildly in terms of when it hits people, where you hit some sort of wall or I don't know what it is, speed bump, something, and the world forces you to say, "Okay, I've proven myself and I'm good at this thing. What do I want to do with it?" And for me, I spent 10 or 15 years proving to myself and to others that I was really good at this thing, basically working with brilliant founders to help bring their vision to life, "That's what you should hire me to do." That's what I was known for.

(01:24:20):
And it turned out that that wasn't what I love doing anymore. And it was really, really hard to walk away from because there was a lot of shoulds. It was like, "You should take this job with this fancy title. People are going to think you're so cool." And you get to... I call it a LinkedIn crush where you're really excited to post the job on LinkedIn, but you're deeply unexcited about doing the job. So you have all these LinkedIn crushes and you're like... And I vividly remember this one job that I turned down where I had to go for many walks. And what I was repeating over and over again to myself was, "What does this get you that you don't already have? What does this get you that you don't already have?" And I think, for me, it was this realization that these things that fed me early in my career just didn't feed me anymore, that I didn't get joy and excitement out of doing these jobs anymore, and I wasn't scared.

(01:25:20):
So it led me actually on a very long, windy journey, a founder journey, even though I have trouble with that title, just like the influencer title, to figure out what I wanted to build. And what I would've told you I wanted to build three years ago is actually not what I'm doing today, but through a lot of really fun experiments and a journey that never ends, what I've discovered is that what I love doing is building safe spaces for leaders to learn and grow, but also to find sanity and connection in a world that's kind of insane, whether it's working in a startup or some other kind of insanity, but that feeds me and there's nothing I love more than that, and I could not have told you that three years ago, but, to Eric's point, it really took a lot of work to switch currents or switch myself from a dog to a cat or whatever his metaphor is. And I think it's the work of it's ongoing work, but it's that thing of what do I want versus what do I think people expect of me?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:32):
There's so much depth there. This could be another entire podcast conversation talking through this journey, but I'm going to close with a note from your partner, Sarah. She told me that she has this sticker on her notebook with three pieces of advice that you gave her when she started at OpenAI. Get to know your customer, they have the answer; be patient because everything is going to change; and just keep trying. So just as a final question, is there anything along those lines that you think might be helpful for people to hear or is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with?

Molly Graham (01:27:07):
Part of what I think is so important to realize inside of scaling and changing companies and the world is some things will always be true. And part of what I was saying to Sarah in the "get to know the customer, they have the answer" is, whatever bullshit is going on around you and whatever walls and ceiling are being rearranged this week, the customer is never going to change. That's a thing that will never change. And I think finding those immovable objects, those compasses in the face of a storm, which being inside of a scaling company in a startup feels like a tornado. And I think OpenAI is extra special on that front. You have to find these guiding lights that get you through that storm. And I think it's sort of the same thing as "Serve the business, not the people." What are the things that will always be true? We are here to do this. We are here to serve the customer.

(01:28:09):
And then the other piece of the three things that she wrote down is, I think that we, as humans, we seek stability. Our brains would like things to stop changing. We would like things to stay the same. And that is just not a reality inside of companies that are growing and changing as fast as OpenAI or a lot of the companies today that are being built. So actually, you need to start to expect instability. You need to start to just assume things are going to change. Assume you're going to have a new boss in six months. I talk about this a lot when I talk to folks at OpenAI, "You need to stop expecting that anything's going to be the same in six months or a year. You will have a different job. You will have a different boss."

(01:28:55):
How do you prepare for that? Do you know what I mean? How do you almost see the instability as stability because it's the only thing that is definitely going to be true. And part of that is to just keep going. You know what I mean? To just find these lights and these compasses or whatever metaphor sticks with you and focus on those because whatever is happening around you, you just got to keep moving forward and keep learning as much as you can because that's the real opportunity. Whatever happens to the company, however successful it is, all that you take away from it... I always say all that you take away from it is people that like working with you and want to work with you again and what you learned. That's it. You might hopefully take a bunch of money, but you might not. So people and what you learned, that's it. Focus on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:41):
It's all about the friends you made along the way. That old line is true. Oh, man. Molly, I feel like we've gone for so long and we've just scratched the surface. I'd love to have you back to go deeper on a lot of this stuff. I'm going to skip the lightning round because we've gone long and I want to keep people from having to listen to more. So I'm just going to end with, what should people know about what you're working on? Where can people go find you online? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Molly Graham (01:30:07):
You can find me on LinkedIn and you can find me on Substack. I have a Substack called Lessons that I'm slowly trying to turn into a community where we can talk about things, the real stuff. And you can find me at Glue Club, which, if you're a leader inside of one of these crazy companies that's changing all the time, we can be a great home for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:26):
What's the URL there just for folks to check out?

Molly Graham (01:30:27):
It's glueclub.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:28):
Glue, G-L-U-E?

Molly Graham (01:30:31):
G-L-U-E.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):
C-L-U-B.com. Great.

Molly Graham (01:30:34):
Yeah, exactly. And in terms of people, what people can do to be useful to me, I love helping leaders with problems. I really get a lot of energy out of unsticking people and helping people feel supported and seen and helping them grow. I do that through Glue Club. So if you're a leader that feels like you want some sanity and some support in the face of whatever tornado you're in, that's a great place to come. But the same is true of Substack. So if Glue Club isn't for you, come on over to Substack. I've opened up a bunch of channels to just talk about stuff, listen to people's problems, answer questions because I love helping people. And I think it's a complicated moment right now to be a leader and to figure out which way is up. So come on over.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:24):
Amazing. Molly, thank you so much for being here.

Molly Graham (01:31:27):
