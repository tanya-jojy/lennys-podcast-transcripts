# Brian Chesky’s new playbook

## Transcript

Brian Chesky (00:00:00):
Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Today my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years, and my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. This is a very special episode for me and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:17):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:03:06):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today. Jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more.

(00:05:00):
Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brian Chesky (00:05:04):
Well, thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:06):
Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you would be on my podcast?

Brian Chesky (00:05:12):
I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such a successful podcast. But yeah, congrats on everything. This is awesome.

Lenny (00:05:18):
I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at Figma Config and a lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb, and I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. And they were trying to decide should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? So I'm just curious to hear from you, what is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?

Brian Chesky (00:05:56):
I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off-stage. I saw somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function and all the designers in the room started cheering. So I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant, because I didn't actually get rid of the people. And also why did the people in the room cheer? Because that's also a thing we should ask ourselves. And I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did that place come from, that 5,000 designers in a room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function? Because if I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would've cheered. It was specifically that function. So I want to talk about what that might mean. It wasn't the people, it's the way they're working together.

(00:06:46):
So we don't have any longer the traditional product management function as it existed when you was here. But we didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. So we actually started off boarding some responsibilities to program management. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. So we don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. So the most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product.

(00:07:42):
So the basic idea is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it. And a lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, it doesn't work, and they say, "We tried that. It didn't work." And if you say you tried and it didn't work, my question is, was it a bad product, a bad strategy or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product? So that is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence. They do not have control.

(00:08:31):
Now you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? Because I want to say ... I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.

(00:09:09):
I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know ... Heads of design. Well-known heads of design. I told them they're not designers, they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization. Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization. Like design is catching things before it goes out the door. It's not actually typically part of the development process. And I think this is not just bad for design, it's bad for product managers and engineers because we all want to build the best products. And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomenon might have happened. And if people are watching this from a large company, here might be some of the characteristics.

(00:09:43):
The first thing you notice is that these different groups might be running on slightly different technical stacks. That's the first problem. And they may actually be accumulating technical debt. The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies. So five teams are going different directions, but they all need a payment platform. And so what happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block. And then at some point they just give up. So then the teams that are dependent on other people say, "Give me the resources and I'll build this group myself." So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign or to leverage some service, they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups. So now they're really becoming separate divisions. And this is where a division comes from.

(00:10:34):
Now, once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority. So now you have to advocate for your division. So there's a lot of advocacy. If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships. And so the people that are liked that build the best relationships are the ones that get the most resources and that creates what we call politics. And so now politics that brood in the company. And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided. And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what. People are going in different directions and that creates a lack of accountability. When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter and that creates complacency. And then suddenly a fast-growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy. This is a general arc that winds up happening.

(00:11:30):
And then you end up having this situation where a company's done 10 marketing efforts, but no customer's heard anything. They have thousands of engineers, they shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did. Marketing and engineering don't talk to each other. It's not even they hate each other, they're in different universes. I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close is engineering and marketing? And marketing is at lot of companies are like the waiters, engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters and they go in the kitchen. In fact, the waiters are the ones talking to the customers all day and they also know how to sell things so you really want them being enjoined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.

(00:12:17):
So this is the problem that we had. And also the other thing we were doing is, as you know Lenny, we were spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually my co-founder who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marking is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is. But if you do need to laser in and balance supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing though doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want an arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits.

(00:13:23):
So a lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy. Product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously we did one today we can talk about.

(00:14:26):
The entire company works together. They row in the same direction. And the product management also does the product marketing. So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there.

Lenny (00:15:24):
That was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about. So I'm going to-

Brian Chesky (00:15:27):
Oh, gee. So we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deep.

Lenny (00:15:31):
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single roadmap you talked about. And what this reminds me of is I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a public company and he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build, and then over time they're encouraged to delegate and to empower and it leads to a bunch of optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics. And then eventually you realize I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.

Brian Chesky (00:16:08):
That's exactly how it went, and that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of. By the way, I think that many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to step away and delegate their product to other people, but suddenly they've delegated away the thing they're best at. The thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief product officer title, but if we had one, it would be me. I wouldn't have a chief product officer. I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech company. If the CEO is not the chief product officer then I don't know if they're a product or tech led company. Maybe that's okay if they're an ops company or if they're a marketing company or if they're not a tech company at all. But ultimately I think the founder or CEO should be that person.

(00:16:59):
So when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us. As you know, I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did ops, I did a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product.

(00:17:27):
And I always remember Lenny there was this paradox where the less involved I was in a project ... Let me be clear. There were times I inserted myself and dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And that was just a learning experience for me. But there was this other scenario where the less involved I was in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved. And the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Because people assume that our natural equilibrium's to move fast so if we're moving slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership and therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for initially, they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always, it seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster so I'd empower them and move slower.

(00:18:26):
And again, how that happened is what I described. That you end up in a situation where you're delegating down. So I think that things were getting worse and slower and slower and slower. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. And by 2019 we were spending a billion dollars on AdWords. We weren't really investing in the brand. We were doing a huge amount of AB testing. I think AB testing is important in times. Actually, let me clarify AB testing. We don't test blue versus green. We have a control and a treatment like I think we did when you were here. So we have a design. We might do a holdback occasionally to see how the thing is working. But if we do an AB test, there has to be a hypothesis. If we don't have a hypothesis and A is better than B, then we're stuck with B. And that's a really, really big problem, but we can never change it.

(00:19:27):
And then imagine 10 teams doing AB testing. Imagine if you designed software the way you designed a house or design a house the way design software. And we AB test a sofa. And we said, well, how does this sofa work? And it seems like with this sofa that we've AB tested people spend more time in the living room, so therefore people are going to like this room better. But actually the sofa has a relationship to the end stands which have a relationship to the lamps which have a relationship to the carpet or the rug which have a relationship to the television which have a relationship to the house and everything else. So you have to think about the whole cohesive system. And I started realizing that. I asked one person on your team, somebody you know well, and I asked him, I said, "I feel like I open our app and the product hasn't changed and four years." I remember saying this, 2018, 2019. And this person described that you know well as just the way we were doing things. The initial way we were doing things to move fast had made us move slow.

(00:20:29):
So what we ended up doing is ... It was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems to not change, costs are rising. I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics. By politics I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole company. More bureaucracy meaning meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio a week. And I didn't really quite know what to do.

(00:21:03):
And then right before the pandemic, I meet two people that really affected how I thought about things. The first was Hiroki Asai. Hiroki now works at Airbnb. He's one of my executives and actually product design, product marketing design and marketing report into him. And he was a creative director for Apple. So he worked for Steve Jobs, was basically dotted line to Steve for many, many years. Came from graphic design. Eventually ran all of marketing communications. In Apple Marketing Communications, they actually designed the app. They made the app. They designed all the marketing touchpoints for the store. So it wasn't just ads, it was every brand touchpoint they were responsible. So everything flowed through marketing. And so marketing became the governing factor that made everything really organized.

(00:21:52):
I met another person or got reacquainted a person named Jony Ive. And Jony Ive was the head of industrial design and Chief Design Officer at Apple. And they described this way of running a company that was totally different than the way that I was running it. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs it this way today, but the services is turning into a division and they are just so big that I think it's not a one-to-one anymore, but they are still technically run this way. And I had this image of not being divisional because we were running ... We had 10 divisions. We had a flights division and we had a homes division which was divided to pro hosts and core hosts and lux and we had business travel and we had a magazine and we had experiences and we had .org and we had China. So we had these 10 different divisions all going in 10 different directions. And I created this culture where everyone would be a business manager or business leader, general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. And so the company kept getting subdivided, subdivided, subdivided and that made it very, very difficult to turn.

(00:22:57):
And this was all about me delegating responsibility. The problem is if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-led founder ... What are you doing? Strategy, capital allocation. My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things. I was in a lot of meetings. Trying to adjudicate different issues between groups. So then the pandemic occurs and I had this image on mind. It's like I have this dream that I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe and Nate in Bolinas. It was October 2019. And I told them I had this dream that I left the company 10 years ago and they just asked me to come back. And I said, "I was horrified at what I found." And they said, "Well, what'd you find?" I said, "I found a company that on the one hand had amazing culture and people with a great mission, with a brand people really loved, but we lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the longterm. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and cost was rising and growth was slowing." And that was exactly what was happening.

(00:24:20):
And then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God. I remember basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near-death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your life flashes before your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near-death business experience and our business flashed before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back involved in the details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing. Before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, what do we do? We need you more involved. And so I got more involved.

(00:25:05):
And when I got involved, I made the following changes. The first thing I did is I said, everything we're doing has to be written down and put into a Google sheet. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, "We're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document." I'm like, "What?" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things. And so if everyone says, "Oh, Airbnb is simple. I'm only doing three things." Yes, but you're one of a thousand people. So actually we're doing 3000 things. So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of the team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup.

(00:25:54):
So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product which turned to product marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. As a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big, it's just say that's how small we are and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.

(00:26:28):
So we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist. Or there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Jony did. They're interchangeable. I could never imagine Jony out at Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true. So people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.

(00:27:11):
I stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. So we're going to have a roadmap. It's going to be a two-year roadmap. We'll update the roadmap literally every month. People may wonder, well, what if the world changes? Yeah, it changes every day. So the roadmap's something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out it changes. It's a rolling roadmap. And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We house 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there's always unexpected events.

(00:27:54):
I created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I made the group much smaller. I took a lot of product managers, I reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained in actual program management because their roles got much bigger. Program management at Airbnb is a high status job. A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. At Airbnb we said because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We said we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects have to be on the roadmap. And then I'm going to review all the work. And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said I'm getting back involved in the project and I'm going to review all the product and all the marketing. So every project I would review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks or every 12 weeks. There'd be a cadence.

(00:28:46):
And then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship. Whether we thought they were work, we don't know until after we ship it. But I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, "Why isn't this happening?" And we would all get together. And so you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. It would be like I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.

(00:29:25):
Because imagine if we're a car company and I see the car prototype every week and I notice there's something about the tires off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. So every week I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify with teams the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace. And so because we had all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate people going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. So these were some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Wieden+Kennedy or ChiatDay or any of those anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.

(00:30:32):
The creative group does not just the ads but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. And writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing. Unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes.

(00:31:16):
Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there because they might not always be there.

(00:32:17):
I basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement, and I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

(00:34:15):
You guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways, in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them. Paid growth and maybe SEO, maybe referrals at least for a while. And you've shifted to let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. And our bet is that's going to grow. Do you feel like this can work for most other products or is there a consumer specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this?

Brian Chesky (00:34:53):
I think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion and we will do some experiments. Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passes. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field, and a lot of companies that do 80% running down the ball down the field and 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone.

(00:35:33):
Here are the things I believe. I'll give you a checklist. Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as this chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they really are running separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain. Because you can't manage people devoid of their work.

(00:36:18):
Imagine a fire chief and they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want hold the product back. I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Eames that said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness, it comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason or the product person is a designer.

(00:37:25):
I would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution. Understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.

(00:38:18):
I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. And you should think of your company in a five or 10 years story. You may not know where you are in 10 years, but you're telling this ongoing story. And most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, actually I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?

Lenny (00:38:48):
Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it. Your winter release. And it is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.

Brian Chesky (00:39:00):
Let me just back up Lenny. You know this problem really well. One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together and we have all this unique inventory and people list it on Airbnb. And every home is one of a kind and we have seven million homes and there's all this surprise and all this delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're going to get. And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth. Where when you open the door you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. And when we survey guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one ... Hotels are not as special, they're not as unique, but the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.

(00:39:56):
And so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's achilles heel, or at least it has been. That with hotels you know what you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know what you're going to get. And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets, plus all the host cancellation data and we use all the signal to create the top two million homes. This collection of two million homes that we call Guest Favorites because the guests rate the highest. We think combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with a reliability you've come to expect in a hotel and I can't imagine there's a lot of use cases where you wouldn't want to book a Guest Favorite.

(00:40:50):
We think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. You see, as you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale through living together certainly. And we felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade. So we obviously made some upgrades to ratings and reviews. The final thing, and this brings up another point I might bring up, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is accurate. But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. So they might not describe perfectly their listing, they might not have filled up their amenities, they might not have a photo tour. And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage their listing. And it was hard to manage their listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.

(00:41:47):
Oh, here's the other thing, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and host team. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team. The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guest and host. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions that become incompatible. So we have product marketers that are responsible for guests and host things, but the designers and the engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project.

(00:42:25):
And then we keep some people, especially the product marketing people on a domain area, but we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface. And so that's what we did. We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed. It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we ever designed. If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of the design we've done. By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic. I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather, but I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.

(00:43:24):
I think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment. Light, texture. I think it's more intuitive, it's more playful. I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces. People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more dimension to it. And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic that I think it's going to be where a lot of interface design is going. And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer visioning language that we trained on 100 million photos and it can basically scan all your photos and organize them by room. So that's what we did today. Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would've been possible in the old way of working. We could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but really getting them to work together has been key. And Guest Favorites has required the guests, people ... You have to work with guests, you have to work with hosts, you have to essentially ... You have to figure out how to communicate to the market. So it's a much more integrated approach.

Lenny (00:44:41):
The designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute. You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures on it. It is really cool. Also, the listing tab. I think people that aren't hosts don't understand how important the listing experience is to a host. How many hosts are there? Seven million? Something like that?

Brian Chesky (00:45:00):
There's seven million listings. Over seven million listings.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Yeah. And so that's the home base. That's like the small business platform for millions of people. And so I worked on the host sites. I have a special place in my heart for host features, and I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.

Brian Chesky (00:45:18):
Well, yeah, you did some amazing work there. Yeah. The big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to create a great guest experience, you need great hosts, and to have great hosts, they need great tools. And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with building great tools for hosts to enable them to provide a great experience for guests. And so that was one of the theories behind the listing tab is we're going to build great tools for hosts. They're going to love it. And we also felt like if we put care in the design of our app, that hosts are going to see that and that they're going to actually put care into hosting. Even more than they already do. And they do put a lot of care in now.

Lenny (00:45:55):
Speaking of great products, a defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think. How you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you is in meetings, we present our goal and you're always saying, "How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?" And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10X'd them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?

Brian Chesky (00:46:32):
As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero. Add a zero at the end, which is to imagine something you order, imagine it bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently. And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10X scale or 10X better or 10X faster where you can't do the current process to do it. You have to think differently about the problem. And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem. And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.

(00:47:22):
And we might call this first principle thinking. What are the foundational elements that comprise this problem and how can we reconstruct them? So the first thing is I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams, that helps them understand a problem. The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do. And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, "Okay, let's circle back on this next week." No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Okay, let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, how do we do this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.

(00:48:18):
But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think, in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once ... I'm going to paraphrase what he said. What is your secret to success? And he said, "That I just asked my players to do their very best." And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.

(00:49:04):
When I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying, you're not good enough, or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me. So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you, and I know that you have more in you. And the way to know if a team could do better is if they're life dependent on it, could they do it? And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. And motivation is if they're life ... Not literally dependent on it, but if it was a crisis or if it was a defining moment in their lives. I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death, that's too far, but to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves, and to really push them. To set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving, soul crushing bureaucracies.

Lenny (00:50:06):
I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. And so I've seen that myself. With some of the things you've talked about of say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back and this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and also all these launches, it sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?

Brian Chesky (00:50:34):
First of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly now, the more I get involved ... This is so weird. The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox. And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense. But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything, we would do endless edits of even the press release, it would seem like I would be working 80, 100 hours a week and that people will be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. And I got just the opposite. Here's what I found. If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.

(00:51:20):
And so for one to two years it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted them to do if I wasn't there. And by the way, that's what the culture is. They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room. And so that became our culture. Suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company. There was less turnover. People were rowing in the same direction. That I wasn't reacting. Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction and by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time on my hands initially, and now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.

(00:52:33):
But to answer your question on burnout, I think is another very good question. I do not think I am the poster child, at least historically, of work-life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would've thought the inverse. That I'd have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you need ... Let's say an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives, slower and slower.

(00:53:13):
And so I basically have tried to make it a practice to step away from the work. And so here's some of the things I do. Every other weekend I don't really work at all. And then every other weekend I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend I'd work more intensely. You wouldn't be a parent every other weekend, but I'm not so it's a little different. I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout. So I usually wake up, I'll do 20 minutes of morning cardio on a Peloton. I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights. I'll basically do cardio just about every day. I make sure that I eat really healthy. I have a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. So I try to make sure I do that. I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.

(00:54:01):
The other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important things that will govern how happy you are in your life is your relationships. I think the three things are your health, your relationships, and your work. Those are probably the three most important things. So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships. And there was this Harvard study. It's the longest study on human happiness. I think it's 85 years old. And the question was, what's the secret of happiness? And of course they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one. And the answer was, the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships. And I had found, Lenny, that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn't have friends. I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them. And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them. And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with, including old friends.

(00:55:03):
So I have a group of high school friends, we have a group chat and we take one to two trips together a year. I have a group of college friends, we have a group chat. We take probably a couple trips together a year. By the way, doing Airbnbs are great. We all get in a house together and it's like your opportunity to have a shared experience. And if you don't travel with your old friends, you'll have only old stories to talk about and then you say the same old stories over and over. So you want to be able to have new shared experiences. When I stay here in New York City ... I'm in New York right now. That's why you don't see my typical background. I stay in my sister's apartment. So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her. And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends. And of course we travel. Traveling is what I do with a lot of my friends. And then I like to draw and read. So I try to make sure it's health, work and relationships. And I try to make sure I have a balance of each. And you might call family relationships. I'm single, but that would be another version of it.

Lenny (00:56:02):
I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you're really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone and they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy.

Brian Chesky (00:56:12):
In the old world, I was reacting, so everyone thought I was busy. So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, "Well, he's busy so he'll reach out to me when he's not busy." But here's a problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now that was a mistake. But I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders. A lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll respond to emails, and suddenly their email sets the agenda. People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them. Versus here's my strategy and then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to be able to execute this strategy?

(00:57:05):
If my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would've wanted to make sure I spent time with? And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's possible, it would completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work, but they don't actually move the ball down the field. And I really try to say yes to the work that's very meaningful and people that are very meaningful to me. So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, but it's true of companies too. You can sometimes be ... You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. You do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Just one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run. If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs, you've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale and just to take on this leadership role? Is it coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.

Brian Chesky (00:58:46):
You ask really good questions. And by the way, thank you. I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner, and I told him, "I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet." And he was really surprised. He's like, "What are you talking about?" And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion, but I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel worthy. But I have this beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's a weird feeling. I think when I first took off, I think I thought I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak or you go into this trough where you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.

(00:59:49):
And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. Pablo Picasso had a saying. He said, "It took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child." And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity. To see everything with fresh eyes. To not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure how to run the company, I studied the history of divisional organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied what Bill Gates did. And I studied Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont. They were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do we do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels so they created what we now know as the divisional structure.

(01:00:46):
So I try to understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives, or one of the biggest honor is when other people ask them for help. Because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It gives a lot of them great honor. And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows the latest distribution channels that I have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning, it's growing, it's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better. To feel like I haven't made it yet. Because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. And I want to feel like an artist. Bob Dylan used to say, "An artist has to be in a constant place of becoming and so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay."

(01:02:05):
And so you have to always be evolving, learning, growing, and the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started and I hope that ... I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intend to do this for a long time and if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said I still believe, but if 100% of what I say, I still believe then I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say I don't believe anymore than I'm delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that? By being curious.

Lenny (01:02:59):
That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple of weeks ago that I'll read real quick. "Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in hours of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, et cetera." How does that feel to have seen that?

Brian Chesky (01:03:23):
I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say I think Sam is obviously a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched ChatGPT I had known him for a real long period of time, and I knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and then research part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales. So there were all these other functional responsibilities. And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary ... And he would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.

(01:04:13):
Before Y Combinator, there was a person named Michael Seibel. He's in Y Combinator. And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. And I asked him, I said, "How do I repay you?" And he said, "Well, I want you to pass this on to other founders." And I would meet with a lot of people in the valley, and there was just this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win if the ecosystem was healthy. And the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another. And you pay it forward. I think that it's just one continuation of the valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.

Lenny (01:05:03):
Final question. When someone joins Airbnb, there's a very longstanding tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.

Brian Chesky (01:05:18):
Yeah. A fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. When I was five years old I remember my parents take me to the Norman Rockwell museum and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings I should say. I shouldn't even call them illustrations. And I would try to reproduce them. And I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them. When I got older, one of my friends, I went to his house ... I'm going to say I was eight or nine years old. And his dad was basically redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe he was an architect. So he had this giant dining room table, and he had this vellum paper and he had a T-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor. They were really cool looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings.

(01:06:15):
So I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture. I went to RPI when I was in freshman year of high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing. Then I got into a film and animation. Then I got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This is when the internet was nascent and people still mailed the annual reports. As so I got my dad to buy a few shares at some Disney stock. And I got these renderings and he had a report of theme parks. And I started drawing and designing theme parks in communities.

(01:07:00):
And I was at this private school actually for hockey. Because I had this life where I was playing ice hockey and I thought I was going to play college hockey. My dad was really into it. I was really into it. And I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact. I basically went to a military high school.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Wow. I did not know that.

Brian Chesky (01:07:22):
And at this military sports academy oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade. And that's not a good thing, by the way. I don't say it as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. And so I leave this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey. And I transferred to my public high school late my junior year. And imagine transferring to a new public high school late junior year. And I meet my art teacher who changes my life. Her name is Ms. Williams, and she sees my artwork. And by the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me, "I chose a job for the love, and I got paid no money. So you should choose a job that pays you a lot of money." And I said to my mom, "One day, I'm going to be an artist." She said, "Oh my God, you chose the only job where you're going to paid less than a social worker." So I think my parents, they were supportive of me going to art, but they were very nervous. And then Ms. Williams told my mom, she said, "Don't worry. He's going to be a famous artist one day." I wasn't going to become a famous artist. But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art.

(01:08:31):
I ended up being a winner, there were multiple winners, of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design where I ended up going to RISD. It's like MIT for design or whatever. It's a prestigious art and design school. But I got to RISD and I realized I was born 100 years too late for what I wanted to do, which is draw and paint. And I felt like at that point, photography and now AI generated art, but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. And that's when I was in my freshman year of college and I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.

(01:09:26):
And really, Lenny, maybe just to round out the story, because that was a fun fact, but I'm just ... And this is the pre founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designer is different than a graphic designer. Because an industrial designer, you have to work with engineering in your training. I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers. You have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design's very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design an office building and the office building doesn't get leased, the architect's usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product, it doesn't sell, you're on the hook for it. At least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you had to understand marketing and strategy.

(01:10:11):
And so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. And the day of graduation Joe looks to me, he says, "Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day." And I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles where I work as an industrial designer for two years when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package and it's a seat cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, "I started a company and everyone in San Francisco ... I live in San Francisco and all these people are starting companies. You should come here." And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I had seen all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I'd never heard his voice before YouTube. And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.

(01:11:18):
And so one day I go into work and I quit my job. My boss is dumbfounded. And I pack everything in the backseat of old Honda Civic. I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay our rent. This design conference is coming to San Francisco. All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference? I didn't have any beds, but Joe had beds and we called it Air Bed and Breakfast.

(01:11:45):
So my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb. Really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different. Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity, I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head and they're disembodied from their heart, and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think that some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded way of thinking about the world is good. So anyways, that's my final thought.

# Product management theater | Marty Cagan (Silicon Valley Product Group)

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02):
Today, I am super excited to bring you a very special episode with Shreyas Doshi, recorded live at the Lenny and Friends Summit in front of 1,000 people in San Francisco. This is Shreyas' second time on the podcast. His first visit is the third most popular episode of all time of this podcast, and I love that Shreyas was game to try this.

(00:20):
In our conversation, Shreyas shares three questions plus a bonus question that he wished he'd asked himself sooner in his career. We talk about why product leaders are so busy, why the job is so frustrating, why it is so central to build good taste, and also why you're probably not listening as well as you should be. This was so much fun, a huge thank you to Shreyas for doing this.

(00:41):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Shreyas Doshi (01:01):
Thanks, Lenny, for having me. This is amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04):
I was going to ask, we recorded our first episode, I think two years ago, and I was in a tiny room in my house. I don't know where you were, but it was very not like this. Thoughts on the setup of this episode?

Shreyas Doshi (01:18):
So first, the Lenny Empire keeps growing, which is amazing to see. And second, as I was coming up here, somebody told me this used to be a car dealership, and I actually realized I purchased my car here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34):
What?

Shreyas Doshi (01:36):
So crazy, only in SF.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38):
What kind of car was this? Say more.

Shreyas Doshi (01:40):
It was a Honda CR-V.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42):
Okay, wow. I am told this venue was also used for... Jimi Hendrix performed here, and Aretha Franklin performed here. So it's like Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Shreyas.

Shreyas Doshi (01:56):
There we go, that's going up on my Twitter bio soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02):
Okay, so usually, when we talk, you're full of ideas and you're full of answers. When we were preparing for this, you told me, "I have questions, I have questions I want to ask."

Shreyas Doshi (02:16):
You know, reflecting on my career as a PM leader over the years, there are some questions I wish I had asked myself sooner, but I did not, and I had the great luck of having a life, a PM life full of suffering, and I have zero complaints about it. But as I look back, I feel like there are some questions that even if I asked myself some questions, those questions, I wasn't honest to myself about the answers. So that's what I thought I'd do, is share the questions that I wish I'd asked myself sooner.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:05):
Awesome.

Shreyas Doshi (03:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:06):
Love that, okay. This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like, Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(03:41):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features, like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(04:29):
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native, customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Are native integrations on your product roadmap? Whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today.

(04:50):
But building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering, according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Coffee AI, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon, so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their Pro and Enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.

(05:37):
What's the first question?

Shreyas Doshi (05:39):
Right, so let's see, the first question is why am I so busy? Why am I so busy? And the background is that I have spent most of my career just being completely stressed out, just absolutely stressed out every day. And there were many reasons for it, but one of the core reasons was I was always super busy, and there was always work I felt like I couldn't do that I wanted to do, and so I would go home at the end of the day, and even if I had worked hard, I'd just feel dissatisfied.

(06:27):
And so that was a constant fixture of my life as a PM, PM leader, and it's only... So I did product work for about 20 years before I started this new chapter of my career. And I think I only fixed it in the last three or four years of my career as a PM leader. But that means that there were about 16 or 17 years where I was just incredibly busy, and because I was incredibly busy, I was extremely stressed, and even though I was doing a good job, I was not feeling very good inside. And then, that showed up in my body, like all sorts of pains and aches I realized were actually not physical pains and aches. They were pains and aches from the stress.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:15):
It's like health issues that you had?

Shreyas Doshi (07:16):
Yeah, yeah, minor stuff. I mean, relatively minor stuff, but playing tennis, and you pull your back muscle, and now you are horizontal for three days, doesn't feel good.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:31):
Who here is very, very busy, and is just way too busy? Raise your hand.

Shreyas Doshi (07:36):
That's it?

Lenny Rachitsky (07:36):
Yeah, I know.

Shreyas Doshi (07:37):
Whoa.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:39):
Everyone's like [inaudible 00:07:39] everybody. Yeah, people were like, "Yeah, yeah. I don't have to raise my hand, I'm busy." Yeah. Okay, keep going.

Shreyas Doshi (07:50):
Yeah, and so here's the thing, when we talk about being busy, and managing your time, energy, all of that, I mean, this is a group of senior product people, so you all know that. Take tips and techniques, like maintain a to-do list. I found the LNO framework very useful for me, which I've shared before. I used to like working out of a calendar, those types of things. And I think you're all familiar with those things, but what I wanted to call out is that, at some point in our product career, we reach something, we reach an immovable force that will just overwhelm us, no matter what we do.

(08:39):
And that force is a scope. Okay, so as we grow in our product career, our scope grows, and we kind of like that, which is all great, but at some point, if you haven't already gotten there, many of you have, but for those of you who haven't, you will get there, where your scope will be so large, that no matter what you do in terms of efficiency, whatever framework you use for prioritization, whatever framework or tool you use to manage your to-do list, whatever tools and techniques you use, whatever prioritization you do, your scope is so large that you are still going to be incredibly busy.

(09:21):
And so that's what I faced, like I was saying for the first about 16, 17 years of working on products, and only in the last 3 or 4 years was I able to kind of find some answers on how to deal with that scope. And so perhaps we can talk about that, what do you think?

Lenny Rachitsky (09:43):
Yeah, so you're basically saying there's all these productivity tricks, ways to do more faster. And no matter how many of these tools you've got, you are just going to take on more and more work, and they'll peter out? I'll say many of my most popular newsletters posts are, "Here's productivity tricks and tips." And so people are always looking for these. And I'm curious to hear where you go with this, of just like that is not the answer long term, there's a different approach?

Shreyas Doshi (10:08):
Yes, and so the challenge is the following. How many of you are going through some kind of annual planning right now or you're planning on going through annual planning? Please. Everybody loves annual planning, great. So let's take annual planning. If you are a high-level manager, leader within a company, what does your month look like? Or in some cases, unfortunately, what do your two or three months look like when you are going through annual planning? It's all these kind of spreadsheets to fill out, and meetings to have, and dependencies, and priorities, and stakeholders to meet, and so on. And so I noticed, for instance, that at some point, that was making me really busy, and then that was making me feel guilty now, because I had my team to look after and to support, and then I had product decisions to make and various other things, and I've gone on some planning retreat or whatever.

(11:15):
And there you go, you last four, five, six, weeks, does that sound familiar to folks? Yeah? Okay, so I noticed that I needed to change that at some point, and actually found a solution, again, late in my career, but I found a solution, because I asked myself this question, which is, "Why am I so busy? I'm doing all the efficiency things, I'm managing my to-do list like a champ. I have my calendar set up just right. I have my routine set up just right. I'm working out so that I'm engaged at work, I'm productive, I'm doing all of that. Why am I so busy? Oh, it's planning season, and that is supposed to take up four to six weeks." And this was at Stripe when I encountered this. So that is supposed to take up four to six weeks.

(12:03):
Well, I realized that you don't have to do that. And so at some point in my time at Stripe, what I realized is the following, we go through a whole all sorts of just rituals around planning for four to six weeks. Then, we emerge and we share our plan with our executives. You know the questions they're going to ask, like, "If money were no concern, what would you do? What is your ambitious plan? So if we gave you five more engineers, what would you do? What other things would you include in the roadmap?" Right? The standard stuff. And so you emerge, you do your presentation, and then you publish the plan, and then you start the new year with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement. And January goes fine, until you get three customer escalations for features that were not in your plan. And so now, you try to figure out how you're going to revise resources.

(13:03):
You go talk to some dependency team that's going to sort of support these new features from these customer escalations. And you go through that process, and you revise your plan again. And then, usually by the time it's last week of February, everybody's forgotten the actual plan. And now, we are executing off of some other list somewhere. And by the way, when you mention this at times, politely of course, you might mention like, "You know, I'm noticing we are not actually really using the plan that we spent four to six weeks minimum doing." And then, some smart person in the room chimes in with, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything."

(13:52):
I don't know, Eisenhower, somebody else, I don't know who said this, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything." Nobody knows what it means. Nobody knows what that means, but everybody appreciates, "Ah, plans are useless, but planning is everything." Right? So I went through a few years of this. And then I go, "You know what? I'm going to bend some rules here." And so what I realized, Lenny, is you don't have to go through these four to six weeks, and it was an accident. Basically, what happened is around that time, the product I was working on, Stripe Connect, it's like a major product for Stripe, major, major business for Stripe. And I had put together a product strategy, like a real product strategy for this product.

(14:44):
And so this must have been earlier in the year. And so now, planning season came along. And the interesting I found is that because I had a real product strategy, not one of those fake ones, a real product strategy that I had gotten alignment on with everybody, my planning for this major product for Stripe took me like three days. Right, so while a lot of my peers, unfortunately, for their own products, were in this four-to-six week cycle of planning, and meeting, and blah, blah, blah, I just put it all together in three days, and whatever artifacts were needed, I put them together.

(15:27):
I did not fill out some templates. That's where it's about bending the rules, because if a template doesn't make sense, why should I fill it out? There's no need to fill it out. And so that's when I realized that actually, if you have a real product strategy, a real one that everybody is aligned with, that you have got pre-alignment on, then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away. Now, you still have to do some resource allocation and all of that, but even there, you don't need that false precision. How many of you have gotten into arguments about, "So should it be eight engineers for this team in 2025, or nine engineers for this team in 2025?"

(16:11):
Like, who cares? We all know that even those numbers that we set up, we don't actually follow through on them, as 2025 happens. So that's just an example of where we spend a lot of time on things that we think are strategic, that we think are important, but actually, we ought to spend that time on other much higher leverage things. Right, now it does require some upfront work, in this case upfront work on a clear product strategy that everybody understands, that everybody's aligned on. But frankly, if you have that, planning should be a breeze.

Lenny Rachitsky (16:49):
So what would be your kind of tactical tip for folks that want to do this better? I know there's probably a billion examples of these sorts of things you shared, so planning is an example. Folks that want to be less busy, maybe on that one is it give yourself very little time, and focus on strategy, and let that be the plan, basically, versus every single person and their roadmap for the next six months. What's the piece of advice you'd share there? And then, I want to move on to the next question, because I want to make sure we get through all these questions.

Shreyas Doshi (17:18):
Yes, there's definitely a specific tip, which is if you do have a strategy that will make a lot of your prioritization problems go away, it will make a lot of planning problems go away. And even if you do have some escalation from sales, which you will, or from support, or somewhere else, you now have at least a more rigorous framework to figure out what to do with that escalation. So there's definitely that.

(17:48):
But I think other thing I want to share is that, and this was my other realization as I asked the question, "Why am I so busy?" is I realized that I am so busy because I'm not making good product decisions. Okay, now, you have to understand, by this time I'm like 15 years into building products and whatever, 11 years into being a product manager. And so I think I'm pretty good. That's my kind of self-image. But then, again, if I'm being honest to myself, I'm not making as good product decisions as I can. So can I share an example of that?

Lenny Rachitsky (18:32):
Please.

Shreyas Doshi (18:34):
So what I noticed is that you have a meeting about some product feature that somehow is requested or is really important, whatever the case might be. And so you have a meeting with some stakeholders and your engineering team, designers, et cetera. And then, you're trying to decide, "Should we build this or not?" And somebody says, "You know what? Why are we doing a meeting for this?" I read somewhere or I heard Bezos say that two-way doors, it's a two-way door. You quickly make a decision. Like, just quickly make a decision and move on. This is a two-way door. And so you say, "Yeah, that's right." And any time we hear something like that, two-way door, you're like, "Oh, that person's really smart, so I want to be like them."

(19:32):
So I noticed that myself and my team, we were making these kinds of decisions without very clearly thinking through customer motivation, very clearly thinking through differentiation, very clearly thinking through a distribution approach for whatever this feature is. And while it sounds like, "Oh, of course you should be doing this," I guarantee you this is not how most product teams work. They're talking about, "Well, is Bob the engineer going to be free? And when are they free? And if they are free, then let's build the feature." That's kind of how a lot of product decisions happen.

(20:11):
The challenge here with this kind of approach, and again, this is what happens in practice, I'm not talking about whatever theory you read, this is what happens in practice. So when you follow this approach and you assume that, "Oh, this is a two-way door, we can kill the feature," in reality, it doesn't work out that way, because here's what happens in reality. So in reality, you commit to the feature, and it's going to take five, six weeks to do it, and then a couple more weeks to make sure, to ramp it up, et cetera, right? And so now the feature is out, and now you have your Q1 QBR, right? Say two months from now you have your Q1 QBR, and you're going to present your business review, whatever. You're going to present what you did, "What did you do last quarter? How are your ships performing from last quarter?"

(21:03):
And so now, it's time to talk about this feature at the QBR, because you have to share that/ Now as you start talking about this feature, the CEO will ask, "So yeah, we launched the feature. I'm very glad we launched this feature. How is it doing?" And you want to be able to say, you are the PM leader, you want to be able to say something smart, and something that makes you look competent. But the challenge is the feature hasn't had much adoption. So I'm not going to ask anybody to raise hands, but I think most PMs are familiar with this conundrum. And of course, we are verbally very agile as product leaders. So what we say is we don't have data, so we use favorable anecdotes.

(21:53):
And so we say, "Yeah, we launched the feature, and you know what? This customer from this company really loves the feature." And we put in an anecdote, it's like, "Life-changing feature." It doesn't matter that they're the only person using it. That doesn't matter. "Life-changing feature," right? We use data when it favors us, we use anecdotes when it favors us. So anyway, so we present that. Now. we do have the sales counterpart in the room too, our sales counterpart, and they say, "You know what, though? We are still not winning many deals because of this feature." And so of course the CEO asks, "So what's up? Why aren't we winning deals, even though we have the feature?"

(22:30):
So the people on the customer side usually we respond, "Well, I'm glad we have the feature, but it's not full featured yet. We need all these other bells and whistles to meet the table stakes." So now, what happens? Somebody uttered the word, "Meet the table stakes." Now, it's over for you, because now, the only response you can give is, "Oh, yeah, that's already part of the plan." And now, you put your engineering leader on the spot and you say, "Alice, isn't it? Haven't we allocated engineers to it already?" And so now, Alice has to come up with some response, which is like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, Carol and David are going to work on it. It's slotted for one of these sprints."

(23:19):
And so now, you exit the QBR, you high-five each other. Well, "Good job, team, great job," et cetera, et cetera. But now, you have signed up for even more work for a feature you should not have built in the first place. That's why we're busy. And through a product leader's life, what happens is we just accumulate all of this debt, feature after feature. So I guess what I'm saying, Lenny, is one of my other tactical tips would be sometimes it is useful to pause for two minutes, or two days, or two weeks before making that decision, right? Because frankly, most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos' level, but as a PM leader, for you, they are a one-way door, and that's making you busy.

Lenny Rachitsky (24:18):

(25:21):
I know it's Spotify, I heard one of their core values is, "Talk is cheap," but it's the virtue version of that. It's like, they actually prefer to talk more, and I think that's exactly what you're saying. Basically, spend more time on these things that seemingly seem just small little ideas and experiments.

Shreyas Doshi (25:37):
Yep, thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:41):
Amazing. Shreyas, what's your second question?

Shreyas Doshi (25:45):
Yes. So my second question, I have to get the words right, do I actually have good taste? Do I actually have good taste is my second question. And for me, I asked this question after, again, all of these things... By the way, everything I say, I have been that guy, I've made that mistake. So that's why I just have to admit to myself that, yes, I have made these mistakes. And one of the mistakes I made, this was when I was at Google, and I was relatively new to product, about less than five years. And at Google, there's some parts of Google where you would be told as an early career PM that like, "We don't do strategy here. Strategy is for MBAs, okay? We are all about execution, okay?"

(26:47):
So I'm in this environment, I'm naïve, and I look around me and I'm like, "Google is the most successful company on the planet," at the time, and they are saying this, and I'm hearing this consistently, so it must be right. It must be right. And so I start saying it. I start saying, "Oh, yeah, execution is everything, and we don't do strategy around here." And I even remember there were not that many PMs, but there was a PM at Google who was kind of like the same level as me, but he just had much more wisdom than me. And he was trying to nudge me into... Like, I was managing a product. And he's like, "Shreyas, what is your strategy here?" And I was like, I told him the same thing. Like, "Oh, no, no, what are you talking strategy? We don't need strategy. We just need to get shit done." That was the thing.

(27:42):
And so I kept repeating that mantra until I got to Twitter. So this is Twitter right after their IPO. And I saw Twitter had an incredible asset, which is the product and the network effects. It had other incredible assets, including the brand. It had other assets that were great, including the talent. And yet, this company was struggling, the product was struggling. And even if it wasn't struggling, it was making a lot of money. But the point is it was not meeting its potential. So that's when I realized, and it wasn't like some sudden realization, it took me six to nine months of being at Twitter. This is circa 2014. That's when I realized that, "Oh, my gosh, Twitter's biggest problem is a product strategy problem. The reason they're struggling is they don't have a real product strategy."

(28:38):
Now, of course, attempts were made to create a product strategy, but it wasn't a real compelling, cohesive product strategy. So that's when I realized the folly of like, "Oh, wait a minute..." I was at Google six years. I spent most of those six years saying like, "Ah, strategy's useless. There's no point to strategy. Execution is where it's at. "I'm like, "No, actually, I was wrong." And that got further solidified as I went to Stripe, and I was kind of now growing earlier stage products and trying to make them highly, highly successful. I saw an even greater value and importance of having a clear strategy. And so that made me realize, basically...

(29:29):
You know, we talk about taste, we all talk about taste, and it's about the beautiful pixels, and the perfect product, and the whatever else, the Steve Jobs-esque passion, and all of that, whatever it is. And yes, taste is about that, but I think there is something that we as product leaders, and certainly I did, needed to recognize about taste as just a factor in pretty much everything we do, which is like, do we have good taste around the beliefs we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders? And then, those beliefs end up dictating everything we do, including how we manage, how we lead, how we make decisions. And so it's that taste I'm talking about when I say, "Do I really have good taste?"

(30:28):
And when I asked myself this question, and again, I really had to dig deep. It wasn't easy, but at some point I realized that no, actually, I don't have good taste. I don't have good taste in how I choose to evaluate things that come my way. Again, not in terms of the product, because by that time I had skills to say, "Well, this should not be a two-step flow. This should be a three-step flow," whatever the case may be. But I still did not have good taste in terms of how I choose what are the things I choose to believe, how do I learn, who do I learn from, what content I learned from, what content I resonate with? And then, I went on this journey to try to develop that better taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:21):
What I'm hearing is people focus maybe too much on the output, like the experience, these experience design taste versus what they choose to take in as informing their taste, and what they see as an example of great and correct. Is that what you're saying?

Shreyas Doshi (31:37):
Yeah. And look, taste is about the ability to identify what is really good, without needing to see its results, because, look, it requires zero taste right now for anybody to say, "Oh, that CEO of NVIDIA is a genius, right? Jensen is a genius." If you are saying that in 2024, it actually requires zero taste, because you can just look up NVIDIA stock price. It requires zero skill. But to be able to say that in 2010, you have to realize Jensen Huang didn't change much between 2010 and 2024. So Lenny, even in sports, there's this saying, "Game recognize game," and that's about taste.

(32:59):
But what we need to understand is it's game recognize game before the game is called, right? Like, game recognize game in the practice session. Because it takes no genius right now to say, "Well, Patrick Mahomes is great quarterback," or, "Virat Kohli is a great cricketer," or whatever else. It requires no genius to do that. It requires zero taste. So I also believe some of us, especially as we get more senior, and we get more successful, and we just get a lot more scope, and responsibility, and a lot of accolades, we become these tough graders. Like, "I don't like anything," right? Like, "Ah, this is crap, this is crap, this is crap." Again, that requires zero taste. Anybody can say that. Anybody can just say, "Everything is horrible."

(33:53):
So I do think there is something about being able to understand that, and I think I'll share some examples. This two-way door thing, so let me just share a few observations, if I might. So the first one is we get overly excited about cool metaphors, okay? Like, one-way door, two-way doors. There's some guy, I don't know who it is, I just read somewhere, there's some guy who had written a blog post about this idea, but he called it reversible and irreversible decisions, and it was the same idea. And I think somebody was lamenting that that did not catch on, reversible and irreversible decisions. But what caught on is two-way door and one-way door. What's the difference? The only difference is you got attracted to the catchy metaphor, and the other one is the authority bias, because Bezos said it.

(34:58):
Take another example, we get very impressed with alliterations. I'm serious, we get very impressed with alliterations. Okay, so how many of us love fail fast? Fail fast, okay, nobody's going to raise hands now. Okay, fine. Maybe you truly don't love fail fast. How about fast follow? How many of you love fast follow? Let's consider that, like fail fast, "We're going to fail fast." What if that thing were called fail quickly? It's the same meaning. Do you think you would be as attracted to that idea if it were called fail quickly?

Lenny Rachitsky (35:44):
No.

Shreyas Doshi (35:46):
Probably not, so what changed? The only thing that changed is one is an alliteration. So I see this in everything. Like, let's see, the other one is we also get very impressed with complicated charts and math we don't understand. And some of you product leaders who are at the top of the game, you actually use this as a strategy. So as I realized that here's the outcome of that, asking myself that question, was that what I realized is everybody says, "Oh, I'm a first principle thinker. I am a rigorous thinker," whatever.

(36:41):
But I realized that if I really want to be that, I have to shed a lot of these just patterns that were just built in me, and I kind of have to evaluate the idea separate from all of its social proof, and authority proof, and whatever else. And that ended up being a meaningful change in my growth as a product leader, because the moment I started shedding these kinds of social proofs, and authority proofs, and all of that, it just made me a much... We all again think we are critical thinkers, but we are not, right? So it made me a more critical thinker.

Lenny Rachitsky (37:31):
I want to move on to the next question, just so we can get through some of these questions. Before I do, can you just show people your notes real quick, just like show it from a distance? This is how Shreyas plans for something like this. There's color coding, I wish I understood what was going on there.

Shreyas Doshi (37:49):
People ask me, "What's your favorite note-taking app?" It's a common question I get, and I say this, right? It's a $5... Like I guess the pen costs $3, and I think the Office Depot clipboard costs-

Lenny Rachitsky (38:00):
Wait, doesn't that pen... Does it have the different color clicky thing?

Shreyas Doshi (38:02):
Yes, yes, yeah. A [inaudible 00:38:04]. Yeah, exactly. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:06):
That's going to be another podcast episode. Okay, so we want to try to do two more questions. We have six minutes left. The last one's a bonus, so maybe we touch on it briefly. Shreyas, what's your third question?

Shreyas Doshi (38:18):
So my third question is why does my job feel so frustrating? Why does my job feel so frustrating? And it goes back to the point that, look, I loved, loved my PM leadership job. I just absolutely loved it. And I think looking back, I would not have exchanged it for anything else, any other experience. That said, there were daily frustrations. There were daily frustrations in that job, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that the PM leader's job is extremely lonely. The PM's job, the PM's on your team, their job is also lonely. But a PM leader's job is further lonelier. So there's that. There's also what I learned at the time when I started asking this question is that our jobs get frustrating when we behave, most of the time, in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core.

(39:32):
Okay, so for me, as I was evaluating that question, it's like, "Why am I getting frustrated every day? I love the job, I love the macro, but I do not like the micro. And so why is that?" And that's when I actually... There's a simple framework that I've shared, which is you can be doing your work at three levels. Product work happens at three levels. There's the impact level, there's the execution level, and there's the optics level. My epiphany as I was exploring this question was I have a preferred level at which I like to operate, but if most of the day, and most of the week, and most of the month, I am forcing myself to operate in not my happy place, in my non-default level, that makes me very frustrated.

(40:33):
So many product leaders, their happy place is the execution level. In my case, my happy place is the impact level. So that is fine. Your happy place can be whatever level, it doesn't matter. But the point is, as you go higher up in the corporate ladder, no matter what kind of company it is, you are now going to have to spend a lot of time on optics, at the optics level. And I have willpower, I have the skills to do it, I have all of that. So it's not about willpower or skills, but willpower is finite. So as I spent day in and day out, just mostly doing optics work, I realized I was not happy and I was getting frustrated. And so that's when I realized the solution, which is I have to abandon the traditional path, that like, "Oh, after this level, I'm supposed to do this, and then I'm supposed to do this, and then this is what society expects. This is what my mom expects. What will people say on LinkedIn when they see my LinkedIn profile?" Like, "Oh, he has this progression, this, and then what stopped? Why did it stop?"

(41:49):
So when I realized this, I said, when a team grew to a certain size, so when I was at Stripe and I realized this, when the team I was managing, it had a fan out of about 50 people, so this includes engineers and everything, I said, "This is enough." Because for me, any time a team goes to like 50s, and 100s, and beyond, it is a law of corporations that you're going to have to spend a lot of time at the optics level. So instead of just pushing, pushing through against who I truly am, what did I do? I just went back to more of an earlier stage product, and then I was fine with like, "You know what? I'm not going to just play the corporate game," as an example.

(42:34):
So I guess my suggestion would be identify your superpowers, and like Shakespeare said, "To thine own self be true." Just be honest to yourself. Operate your career and make your career decisions not out of expectation, not out of envy, like the LinkedIn envy of like, "Oh, this person is at a different level. We both went to the same grad school, so I got..." No, identify your superpowers, because if you identify your superpowers and work in accordance with them, you will do the best work of your life. You will love it, and you will be great at it, and you won't have that frustration.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:23):
I wish we had an hour for every single one of these questions, I feel like there's so much more to get into. We have 40 seconds. Do you want to touch on your last question or do you want to leave that for a follow-up discussion?

Shreyas Doshi (43:35):
Let's touch on it, let's touch on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:37):
Okay, we got to go though in 30 seconds.

Shreyas Doshi (43:38):
All right. My last question is am I really listening? Okay, and this is perhaps the hardest one for me, because I thought, of course I'm a good listener because I listen, then I recap, and I make eye contact, and I tell them, "This is what I heard," And all of that nonsense. I realized there is an entirely other level to listening, which once you understand that there's an entirely other level to listening, that is what enables you to be a world-class leader. And so that is what I guess my last takeaway is, is ask yourself, "Am I really listening?" If you want resources, there are very few people who actually talk about what that real listening means. I would refer you to what Rick Rubin says about listening, I would refer you to what [inaudible 00:44:30] said about listening, and what Drucker said about listening as some pointers.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:36):
Amazing. Shreyas, you said you were going to hang out for the next hour somewhere. You want to share that real quick, and then we'll get off?

Shreyas Doshi (44:42):
Yes, I will maybe try to hang out in the back part of the room.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:46):
Be quiet back there, too.

Shreyas Doshi (44:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:47):
Shreyas, thank you so much for being here.

Shreyas Doshi (44:50):
Great, thank you. Oh, should we take a picture?

Lenny Rachitsky (44:54):
Oh, yeah. We're going to take a quick selfie.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
We're going to take a picture.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:59):
There we go. They're going to turn lights on, I think.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
Oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:00):
Okay.

Shreyas Doshi (45:03):
All right, folks.

# Unorthodox frameworks for growing your product, career, and impact | Bangaly Kaba (YT, IG, FB)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You're early growth PM at Facebook. You're head of growth at Instagram, you're VP of product at Instacart. You're now director of product management at YouTube and I've heard that you've had a lot of impact on a lot of different cultures.

Bangaly Kaba (00:00:10):
I found this framework travels with me. It's got these five components to it, vision, skills, incentives, resources, action plan, and you need all of those to have change. And then within those buckets you've got to figure out what are the right levers that you need to pull? What are the things that are missing?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
You're really big on something you call understand work?

Bangaly Kaba (00:00:29):
What I call the anti-paren of what we want to do. Someone says, "Hey, you know what? This would be great to build." And you go pull data to go justify why that would be great to build. Call that identify, justify, execute. First you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on. So understand, identify, execute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
You wrote this legendary blog post called How to Choose Where to Work and What to work on.

Bangaly Kaba (00:00:50):
There's impact that you're really trying to drop and the impact is only achievable by looking at set of variables related to the environment, the set of variables related to your skills.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today's guest is Bengaly Kaba. Bengaly was an early growth PM at Facebook where he was responsible for how people make friends on Facebook. He was Head of Growth at Instagram where he helped scale a platform to over 1 billion users. He was also VP of product at Instacart. He's also worked with tons of amazing startups as a Growth Advisor, including Twitter. He's now Director of Product Management at YouTube where from what I hear, he's already made a huge dent. This conversation went long because there was so much gold to be extracted from Bengaly's head and I could not stop myself from learning everything I could in our time together. This episode is for anyone looking to level up their product and growth chops or also just do better in your career.

(00:01:42):
We dig into his framework for how to choose where to work and what to work on. The importance of spending time on something he calls understand work, his adjacent user theory and how it can help you drive growth. A bunch of advice for coaching product managers and managers of managers, tons of lessons and stories from his time at Instagram, Facebook and YouTube and so much more.

(00:02:18):
Bengaly, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Bangaly Kaba (00:02:22):
Thanks for having me. Excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:24):
So many previous guests have recommended that I get you on this podcast, which I already knew. Funny story, when I first launched this podcast, I asked you to be on it. You're like, "Sure." And I included you on my launch poster of all the guests that are going to be on the podcast, and then you decided to take on a very hard work and jobs that kept you from having time, and so I'm really excited that we're finally doing this.

Bangaly Kaba (00:02:47):
I'm glad we're finally making a reality. Sorry about that, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:50):
No sweat. You actually mentioned to me that somebody came up to you in Zurich and was like, "I'm excited for you on Lenny's podcast."

Bangaly Kaba (00:02:57):
Yeah, it was crazy. I was visiting a team that I managed there about to get back on a plane to go back to SFO and just standing there doing some work, minding my business and I get on the plane, I'm talking to a colleague and someone comes up to me, I don't think I've ever seen them before, and said, "Hey, sorry to interrupt you. I'm so excited for your podcast with Lenny. I can't wait for it." And then just walks away and I was like, "What is going on right now? Lenny is a big deal. I don't even know how this person knows me." And that's how I knew Lenny, that I had to reschedule with you because I was like, if people are coming up to me and telling me that they're excited, I was like, there is a lot of anticipation. And Lenny, the power of your reach now is legit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:37):
That is hilarious. That's a new strategy for me to get people on the podcast just say they're going to be on the podcast and then the pressure will start.

Bangaly Kaba (00:03:46):
Oh yeah, I mean, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:46):
Okay, so there's two broad topics that I want to spend our time on today. I want to talk about career advice and growth advice and they're both essentially growth oriented, one's career growth, one is product growth. How does that sound?

Bangaly Kaba (00:03:57):
Sounds perfect.

(00:06:23):
Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust. Members FDIC. So let's maybe start with the career. You wrote this legendary blog post called How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On that a few people have mentioned to me was really impactful in their career. And just to remind people of your career path, which they'll hear in the intro, but just to give people a reason to listen to your advice on career, you are early growth PM at Facebook, you're Head of Growth at Instagram, you're VP of Product at Instacart. You worked with a ton of amazing startups as an advisor, including Twitter, you're now Director of Product Management at YouTube. This is a career that many people would dream of having. So let's just spend a little time on this topic of how to choose where to work and what to work on. And I know you kind of have this framework in this post, so maybe that's a good way to start out just how you broadly think about where to work and what to work on?

Bangaly Kaba (00:07:18):
Yeah, that blog post that you're referring to actually came out of a personal struggle that I had when I was at Facebook and trying to decide what my next move should be. I felt like I was kind of stuck. I felt like I was working harder but not seeing incremental benefit to the work that I was doing. And I knew that I needed a change, but emotionally I understood that, but I couldn't really have an objective way of thinking about it. And so I really pushed myself to figure out what is actually going on with my situation and how do I create a way that I can rely on objectively to understand what's actually going on? And so I looked at that situation and I wrote that post and the framework is really that there's impact that you're really trying to drive and that is the thing that is the most important. And the impact is only achievable by looking at two sets of variables, a set of variables related to the environment, a set of variables related to your skills, and really breaking down each and understanding what's happening in the environment bit by bit and what's happening with your skills and where are you hindered structurally within the environment? Where are your skills kind of lacking and what do you have control over? And using that whole kind of output, that framework to decide what makes the most sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:40):
Why is impact the key output of this equation? I think for a lot of people that isn't necessarily the intuitive variable that they think is important to focus on. Why is that so important in your experience?

Bangaly Kaba (00:08:51):
Yeah, I mean I didn't really know how to think about what the right thing to optimize for was initially, and I realized that it's not compensation. Compensation is a reflection of the input, the impact that you're having, and you're leveling how [inaudible 00:09:12] you are, how much scope you have is a derivative of how much impact you're driving. The more impact you're driving at your company, the more people feel like you can operate independently, you can drive real results the more that scope they'll give you. So really impact became the thing to optimize for. It is the import and compensation becomes an output based on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:32):
I think this is a really important point that is easy to miss and this is what I always tell people when they're looking for ways to get promoted and do well in companies, just find ways to have more impact. Can you maybe make it even more concrete? What does impact mean to you when you talk about impact?

Bangaly Kaba (00:09:46):
Yeah, I mean, so impact can be a lot of things, but I think for a product manager for example, it's really one, helping to drive extreme clarity about where the problems with the product, where there's opportunities and what is the right focus and prioritization? That is actually a form of impact. Just creating the clarity that people need to understand and believe in the investment. The reason why I name this and it feels a little counterintuitive is that the more senior you get, the more there are questions of are we even investing in the right place, right? Is this area, is this team, is this org the right investment? And so being able to even create the clarity that there is opportunity, it is the right thing to do, it is strategically and structurally important, is a form of impact. And then actually delivering on that impact, showing that you can make progress quickly, that you can deliver fast lane wins as Casey Winters would say, or medium and slow wins and then actually showing that you can do this again and again is how you actually validate the impact that you can see where the opportunity is and what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:53):
Awesome. Okay. So this equation is impact equals environment type skills. Can you talk a bit about how to work on these two elements?

Bangaly Kaba (00:11:01):
So the environment was the one to me, that I think is most people overlook and I overlooked when I was first thinking about this. Environment in this case, I think I kind of discreetly named a few things. One is your manager, then there's the resources. So what kind of team do you have? Is your team staffed appropriately? Do you have the right P&L, whatever budget to get the things done that you need? Then there's a scope, what is in your remit versus not in your remit? Because if you don't have enough scope, then you can't actually focus on the things that are most important. The team itself, the skills, relative skills of the team, your compensation in some ways is part of the environment because if you're not compensated fairly, you don't believe you are, then it's hard to feel like the work that you're doing is meaningful.

(00:11:47):
And then there is the last part is the company culture. So to what extent is the culture a place where you feel supported, included, you feel like you can do your best work? And so you are really looking at each one of these variables, and I look at this every year and I say, "How is my manager doing?" How do I think about my manager? How do I think about the resources I have, the scope, the team, the conversation, the company culture and to what extent? And I score them, I score them as a 1 means it's kind of neutral. A 2 means that I'm greatly benefiting from this situation and something even closer to zero is I'm not in a good place. So I assign a score in quarter point increments, 0.25, 0.5, 0.751 up to 2 every year. And I really ask myself, what is the state of each one of these and to what extent do I believe that they can and will change?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:40):
Wow, I love this. So there's this formula, impact equals environment times skills. Within environment there's these five variables and they add up to 10?

Bangaly Kaba (00:12:49):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:50):
If they each give you two points. That's so cool. Okay, so the five, just to be clear, your manager, the resources you have, is teams number three?

Bangaly Kaba (00:12:58):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:59):
Compensation and then the culture of the team?

Bangaly Kaba (00:13:02):
And then your scope as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
And then scope. Okay, got it.

Bangaly Kaba (00:13:04):
It's actually six, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:05):
Oh, there's six. Okay, got it. So it's up to 12. So the idea here is you score each of these of how you're feeling, how the environment is contributing to the impact that you're delivering. And if one of these is not a great score, that's an opportunity to improve your impact, which will improve your career?

Bangaly Kaba (00:13:26):
That's right, and you have to really be honest. I think part of what makes this framework so powerful for me at least, is that it helps you to be honest around what are the things that are limiting your ability to have impact and for your skills to really land? And to what extent do you believe that you can help to change or try to influence the change in the environment? Because no one wants to be in a place where there's a bad culture and the culture is a bad fit for you, but if you're not really thinking about it objectively and naming that, or maybe it's the culture of the team that is not the right place for you, so it really forces you to evaluate what's going on around you that's limiting your impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:05):
Is there an example from your career you could share where one of these was not where it needed to be and either helped change it or realize you had to get out of there?

Bangaly Kaba (00:14:14):
When I was actually at Facebook, I was running the team that does all the people recommendations and it was a great team. I actually had a massive, massive team. I had 30 engineers I was working with, 15 machine learning engineers and 15 front end and back end engineers. And so great team, incredible team, lot of resources, ton of scope. In some ways it was too much scope and to me that was problematic because I really needed to build out, I felt like multiple teams to support the work that we were doing or to break it up; because it was, I mean the pace, the velocity you can imagine at Facebook was incredible. And I felt like between all of the work that we needed to do, the amount of engineering capacity that we had and the amount that was on the table, I felt like I wasn't resourced in a way where I felt like I could actually deliver on all of the things that were necessary without burning myself out. And I felt like I was burning myself out and I couldn't really see the forest through the trees because there was so much to do.

(00:15:20):
And so that was a situation that I didn't really understand how to navigate at that point in my career. And there were two or three manager changes concurrently, and so I didn't have a manager to lean on that I felt like I had a relationship with to help me to navigate that space. And I felt like the scope was actually too much for what needed to be done, and so I needed to find a better kind of fit for me. There was nothing wrong with the team, it was a great learning environment, but it was the confluence of scope and manager and all happening at once just wasn't a good fit for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:53):
A lot of people are in these situations where they'd say they go through this score, they identify I have way too little scope, way too much scope like you described, and there's always this question of can I actually make a change or is this just not, am I not in a position? Especially, I see product managers, there's just always a lot of, I can't actually change anything. What do you often tell people around this that just feel like there's nothing I can do here and my manager sucks, what am I going to do?

Bangaly Kaba (00:16:17):
Well, I do think one of the things that I recognize is your manager. Not all of these variables is created equal and the manager is the most important variable in the environment, because a great manager who is empathetic, who is aware of what's going on, who is a great communicator, has the ability to move the chess pieces around and to fix some of these for you either immediately or in time. There's no one other than your manager who can really help to increase your scope or to help make sure that the team has the right pieces in place, or dial in some of the issues that you might see in culture.

(00:16:56):
And so that is why people say they don't leave a job, they leave a manager because the manager is the one that has a lot of the power to fix a lot of these variables. And so really the question becomes like to what extent have you been able to clearly articulate what are the... And dispassionately articulate, what are the challenges that you're having, you're seeing across some of these variables with your manager? Help them to tie it back to how it's impacting your work and see if they can help you to create a plan to alleviate some of these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:28):
That's super interesting. Then your experience with the manager is kind of the core of a lot of these variables. Is there anything you recommend to people if their managers is not someone they like, is it just try to find a new manager or potentially leave?

Bangaly Kaba (00:17:39):
You're never going to always like your manager, right? That's not the... The goal isn't to like your manager. Ideally, you respect them and they respect you, you feel like there's things that you can learn from them. Finding a new manager is always an option, but I guess sometimes the real question is, is actually spending time to try to understand what is your manager optimizing? A lot of times I think there is a big disconnect between an IC focusing on their discrete area and try to optimize for local maxima, versus understanding, okay, my manager's thinking about these things and this is how I fit in, and understanding maybe they have a gap to understanding why your area is important. Or maybe there's stuff that's on your manager's plate that is actually adjacent to your remit that if you understood that they were optimizing for, you can take that on and you would find more synergies with what they're trying to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):
I love that advice. Let's talk about the other side of this equation. We've talked about environment, let's talk about skills. What do you advise there for folks that want to improve their skills?

Bangaly Kaba (00:18:37):
The skills part is really, really big and it's something that requires I think, consistent evolution of your own abilities. And so I broke it out in that blog post kind of communication, your ability to influence your leadership, strategic thinking and then execution, actually getting things done. The communication above these, again, not all of these are created equal. I think communication is the one that tends to be the most impactful. And you see this in a lot of ways. You see this for people who are poor executors but incredible communicators and they seem to continue to rise and rise because they can tell a great story, but when you look under the covers, there's nothing there. There's no substance there.

(00:19:17):
So communication for better or worse is one of the most important things. But building out your skills I think is really just kind of a, it is an interesting time to be in product and to be in tech right now because you have so many more ways to build out your skills than what previously existed. Just so many incredible blog posts like your podcasts and blogs, there's so many incredible people who've come on here who tell you things like how to go to market, how to think about B2B SaaS and metrics. And so listening to you, reading Ben Thompson, understanding his mental models, if you go to look at Elena Verner or whoever, there's so many thought leaders who are out there.

(00:19:56):
So I think being a voracious reader is really, really critical because it helps to build your toolkit and you need arrows in your quiver to really understand how to think about the right framework and the right mentor at the right time.

(00:20:09):
One thing I also tell people is people think about mentorship as like, I have a mentor, Lenny is my mentor, or John is my mentor. I tell them, it's actually better to have a stable of mentors. You want to have three or four. And ideally, what you do is you meet with each one of them once a month on a different Friday of the month. And so you might have three or four people on every Friday you're meeting with someone different. And the reason why this is so important is because if you, Lenny, are a mentor to me and you're busy one Friday and we only meet once a month now I don't have anyone to talk to for two months. And you're going through a lot of things and you're not really able to bounce ideas, or build skills or learn how influence others, but if you have three or four mentors, you have someone different to talk to every week. And if one or two of them cancel, you still have two people to talk to that month and you still can continue to grow and to build your thinking.

(00:21:01):
So that's something I always recommend. And then the last thing I actually talk about is, when it comes to execution, I think people don't, especially product managers, don't do enough of watching and learning from others. There's an art and a science to product management. And in a lot of ways I come from a background of education and in a lot of ways in product management, it's very similar. You want to watch how well the people hone their craft, how they deliver, how they lead teams and kind of steal things from them. Figure out, well, wow, Lenny did this really, really well when he was at Airbnb. It was really incredible. I'm going to take that. I'm going to take how he runs that team, or how he landed that framework, or how he communicated this message and note it and use it in my own toolkit later on. And so if you're really a student of product, you can't just be a student of theory, you've got to be a student of practice too, meaning you're going and you're looking, it's like, "Hey, I'd love to sit in your team meetings. Can I come watch? Or your PM meetings or your leadership meetings." And you are really like doing that for the sake of learning is really, really incredible. And that's some of the ways I talk about building skills.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:05):
Is there an example of that latter lesson that you learned from someone that comes to mind of watching someone and like, oh, I'm going to do that.

Bangaly Kaba (00:22:13):
Earlier in my career, when I first got to Instagram, I wasn't the first Growth PM, but I was one of the first and a guy who was there before me, his name was Georgia Lee, he actually stood up the growth team and ended up leaving six months right after I joined. But I watched, George was a really good listener. He had just a really incredible ability to be in a room and hear what was going on, to recast it back and make sure that everyone felt good about where we were and what was being said and the path forward, and really crystallizing the action items and also how people felt about what the next steps were. And walking out of that meeting, it felt like he always had buy-in and clarity and was helpful to build trust. You can see him almost winning trust in every moment of that meeting. And that was something that I really admired, and learned, and kind sought to emulate later on in my career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):
That's an awesome example. It comes back to the skill of communication that you talked about, just the power becoming really good at that. And this is such a simple skill you just described, is just recapping, here's what we talked about. Here's what we're going to do. Here's the decisions we made. Here's action items. It's not actually difficult, it's just-

Bangaly Kaba (00:23:30):
It's not, actually. But what was magical about the way he did it. It's like he would name people and their contributions and show how all of this came together into what is the path forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:41):
That is amazing.

Bangaly Kaba (00:23:41):
And it's the communication, but it's also the other side. It's the other coin, the side of communication, which is eliciting to figure out how you communicate back to others.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:49):
So good. Following up on something else you talked about, which is mentors. Anytime someone talks about finding mentors, everyone's always, how do I find a mentor? What advice do you share with folks of how to find a mentor to help? You say once a week or once a month?

Bangaly Kaba (00:24:03):
Where I see people find the most success is they ask. They tell people what they're working on or what challenges they have and they say, "Do you know someone who I might be able to learn from who has done this or has good thinking about this recently?" So instead of just going to someone saying, "Hey, can you be a mentor?" Coming to me and say, "Hey, Bengaly, I'm actually trying to figure out how do I change the way this team operates because we need to go from this model to that model, but here's some of the challenges. So do you know someone who's actually really good at changing the way teams work or really good at communicating a new vision that I can talk to?"

(00:24:40):
And so that I think is really important because what you do is you're creating a seed, and the seed is there's a triad and you have the person who's looking for the mentor. You have the recommender, the recommender, and then you have the potential mentor. And the recommender is basically saying, "Here, there's common purpose between the two of you and I can see it, and I think this is important, so I want you all to come together." And that triad in that moment creates a higher affinity, highly likelihood that the person who needs the help and the person who you're connecting them with are going to see mutual benefit from one another. And I think I find that just doing that and seeding that and being really focused on what the opportunity or the challenge is, tends to lead to better connections as opposed to just reaching out and saying, "Hey, I like your style. Will you be my mentor?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):
So essentially share with folks you trust, here's what I'm working on. See if they recommend someone that could help you with that specific skill versus assuming that there's this person that can help you with this skill?

Bangaly Kaba (00:25:40):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
I love it. Going back to your advice on career, something that you wrote about in your post plus folks have told me you're really big on, is this something you call understand work? Does that ring a bell?

Bangaly Kaba (00:25:53):
Yes, it does.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:53):
Okay. Talk about that and why that's important?

Bangaly Kaba (00:25:56):
I certainly cannot take credit for understand work. This is part of an old Facebook framework of understand, identify, execute. What I-

Bangaly Kaba (00:26:00):
Facebook framework of understand, identify, execute. What I probably will say is I guess I've been the shepherd for understand work in other companies. I've taken it from my time at Facebook and Relink Institute or rigorously at Instagram, then at Instacart and when I helped with Twitter, now at YouTube. The way I like to talk about it with my teams is that first I tell a story actually, and the story is we've all had a moment where we have worked on something with a team, super excited, finally it launches and we go out to dinner and we celebrate. And we're celebrating, everyone's juiced. It's great night. You go back to the office the next day and you look at the metrics and the metrics are flat and everyone's a little bummed. Why did this happen? Right. Why are the metrics flat? What happened? We worked so hard.

(00:26:49):
And ultimately when you unpack it, you realize that you built something that you thought was going to be a good idea, but you really didn't understand a lot of key components of what people really needed, what pain points really existed, or what were the alternatives and what the real value of those alternatives were in the market, or exactly how the product needed to work, what the flywheel or what the experience needed to be. And so that is what I call the anti-pattern of what we want to do and I call that identify, justify, execute. Right. Where you identify something, someone says, "Hey, you know what? This would be great to build." And you identify that, then you go pull data to go justify why that would be great to build and then you sink an ungodly amount of time working on it in order to make it work, but it ultimately doesn't succeed.

(00:27:36):
And that is the anti-pattern to what is kind of like the Facebook kind of way of thinking, which is understand, identify, execute, right? So first you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on. So when we talk about understand work, there's a few ways to think about it. One is, it is an intentional affordance in your execution to do the work that helps you to de-risk a project and to learn what's going on. When I say an intentional affordance, meaning you put it down like Lenny is going to work on this thing. Right. Lenny as a product manager is going to write a strategy. Janice as a designer is going to design a prototype, whatever the thing is, and you put it down as actual an item as opposed to assuming it's going to happen in the background. We don't make an affordance for understand work, then the work doesn't get done and everyone's just sprinting on execution.

(00:28:27):
And so it's a planned intentional time to the team's bandwidth to figure out what is it that we need to do to understand what's happening. And so for example at Instagram we did a lot of understand work of what makes for a good connection? Right. How do we want to think about that? How do we want to make sure that we're actually growing a graph, a social graph that makes sense? And so I might work with data science to do understand work, to pull a funnel and look at the different types of connections for different types of users and make it make sense. Right. And engineering might do understand work to instrument logging to make sure that we have the data that we need in order to tell the story. And so you're doing this understand work to basically better understand the gaps in knowledge. What's also really interesting is that understand work helps you to clarify what is a root cause, or what is a job to be done, or what is the right use case?

(00:29:25):
And because the team adopts this mentality, it becomes this forcing function for execution. So when someone says, "You know what we should build? We should build this." You have a team that's enabled and empowered to say, "That's a good idea, but we don't actually understand these three things before we start working on that. So maybe we should do understand work to make sure that that is actually the right idea." Right. And so what you end up getting by embracing this concept is two things. You get parallel paths of work. So every sprint, let's say you do a three-week sprint or a three-month roadmap, you're executing on the things that you have a lot of conviction around and you're also doing understand work in parallel. And so at the end of the sprint you have learnings from what you executed. Wow, that test or that launch worked really well. We should double down. Or Wow, that test or launch didn't work. Here's how we should pivot. And you have insights from the understand work and you use both of those to plan the next sprints or roadmap. Right.

(00:30:29):
And so because you have this parallel path, you end up getting this velocity multiplier over time. Right. So the next sprint, and the third sprint, and the fourth sprint, every subsequent sprint you de-risk new ideas, you've gotten more clarity. And so you do more execution, you do better execution and you move faster and the things you ship, you have a higher win rate on the things you ship, right? And your shipping, I remember when I left Instagram, this is many years ago, but we had 15 teams and we might've been running 12 to 20 experiments a quarter a team, and I would say probably 60 to 70% of them were positive and shippable, which is incredible. I mean, you think about and multiple and the magnitude of that and it was because we were so effective at de-risking and understanding what was going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:18):
This is really interesting. I imagine many people listening here are like, we put time into understanding, we run experiments, we write strategy docs, we use research. What is it that you think people are, where do you think they're missing? Is it that you dedicate people's actual time, like you're just doing understand work instead of building a new thing. For this next sprint, you're just going to be telling us what the problem here or opportunity is. How do you actually operationalize this versus just what people probably already do, which is user research, data dives?

Bangaly Kaba (00:31:47):
What I found is a couple things. One is when your team does not fully understand a problem space, the balance of work tends to be higher. I think when I started at YouTube we were doing 60% execution, 40% understand work. Right. And over time, as we understand more and more, the mix shifts. Now my teams are probably doing 80% execution, 20 to or 85% and 20 to 15% understand work.

(00:32:18):
And so it's not just about writing a strategy, it's about saying, okay, if we have these themes of stuff that we want to work on, what do we know with confidence because the data tells us and what do we need to understand because we don't have the data, we don't have the research, we don't have the insights? And really being honest with yourselves around what are the things that are low to medium effort but high likelihood of being impactful because you have the data and what are the things that you are interested in perhaps doing, but because you're missing something, you're missing research or feedback from users or data or some insights or strategy. You should actually say, I'm going to go do this before I do something else. Right.

(00:33:03):
An example of this is one of my teams ships paid virtual goods in the live experience on YouTube. And that's a really, really important and hard problem space. And when I joined, we didn't really fully understand the whole live ecosystem, like how we lived in that live ecosystem, how our products worked, where the biggest opportunity was. So the first and most important piece of understand work was instead of shipping iterations to the current product, we needed to actually get the funnel of what was happening. Right. Like what's happening with how many people are watching live every day, how many people are clicking through, how many people are seeing our experience, how many people actually buying it? We didn't really fully have the experience mapped out and to understand where were the gaps and where are the problem space is in, where should we be focusing?

(00:33:52):
And so we had to do that. And that was understand work for multiple people, for multiple teams. We had to do on the engineering side, we needed data science as analysis. We needed the PM to go and dog through the experience to figure out what was broken. All of that was intentional and an affordance on our roadmaps.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:08):
What's interesting about this is that this is very counterintuitive to how people would probably approach, hey, we need to speed up execution, we need to speed up growth, we need to ship more, execute, go faster, do more. And what you're saying is you find the impact comes from actually slow down how much we're doing and spend more time understanding to execute more intelligently.

Bangaly Kaba (00:34:32):
That's right. Slow down and speed up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:33):
Fascinating. Because it's interesting, I have a bunch of questions that emerged out of folks that you've worked with and many of them are around how you turn a culture around, speed things up, and drive growth in a really meaningful way. And it sounds like this is one of your key strategies, is get people to spend more time understanding before diving into a bunch of stuff.

Bangaly Kaba (00:34:54):
It does sound counterintuitive, but if you actually think about it, what is a better outcome? Is it a better outcome to just ship more faster now, but most of the things aren't unimpactful? Right. Or is it a better outcome to ship fewer things but really work on making sure that you're shipping them in the best way and de-risking a lot of other things so that a year later your win rate's higher and your velocity is higher?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:19):
Yeah, I think counterintuitive is the wrong word. I think it makes sense. I think it's just no one does this. Usually everyone's like, move faster, we need more and ship more experiments.

Bangaly Kaba (00:35:28):
Well, I mean this is the irony of growth, is people think growth is overnight success and it's not. Right. It is a lot of short wins and short-term execution for a longer-term gain and really understanding you have a lot of short terms towards the longer-term outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:48):
So that people can take away this lesson, can you help people understand just when you say understand work, like what does that look like generally? Is it just a dedicated time to dive into data and answer a bunch of questions you've sent them? Is it running experiments to test hypotheses? What does that usually look like when you're, here let's do 40% understand work?

Bangaly Kaba (00:36:10):
The understand work sometimes comes from me, but most often comes from the teams themselves. And every function can do and should be doing understand work at some point. Right. And so it really depends on what the function is. So for an engineer, it could be looking at the code and saying, okay, we want to improve this. I need to do understand work to understand do we need to refactor this code and how scalable is it and what do we need to do to make sure that we can execute fast and make sure that we're not going to have a lot of start and stop? That could be understand work. It could be actually instrumenting the data and making sure that we actually have full visibility into what's going on. Data science, like we work a lot with data science doing activation metrics and understanding proxy metrics. Right. That's understand work because it helps us to figure out what we need to build and where to focus.

(00:37:05):
For product management, sometimes understand work is figuring out the partnership strategy ahead of actually launching the product because you need to go figure out how the pieces are going to come together. Right. And so it really just depends on what the function is. But when I say it should be coming from the bottoms up, what I mean is I encourage the team when we plan a sprint or plan a roadmap, to ask a question to identify the key themes that they need to work on. And when they ask a question on a key theme, also ask what else do we need to understand to make this happen? And in that planning session, to make sure that you are including cross-functional partners. So it's not just product design and data science and Inge, you also include go to market, you also include marketing because if you're not inclusive, then you don't really understand what the issues are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:55):
My PM brain is afraid of creating too much understand work and nothing getting done. How do you find that balance of we're going to be understanding for hours and days and weeks and months and not shipping much? How do you do some,-

Bangaly Kaba (00:38:11):
I tell them, you have to ship. I mean, you always have to ship, right? Sometimes I give them, sometimes it's helpful, especially early on because it takes a while for people to get their head around why this is so critical. I say, we should choose, sometimes I'll give them guidance. We should choose three to four understand projects that are going to really help this roadmap and figure out what they are. Right. So choose your top three or four and then let's talk about it. And I'll give them guidance. Or I would say figure out... There should always be some execution. So initially you're looking for low effort, high impact things to execute against. Right.

(00:38:53):
And so build a portfolio of work to do every sprint or every roadmap, some of which should be low effort, high impact, some of which should be medium effort, high impact. And sometimes understand work actually looks like doing a cheap test, doing a test that's going to help us to learn as fast as possible that we think is a good enough experience that can inform us. Right. And so identifying ways to do that. And so it's really about just managing expectations and helping people to be clear that the goal is to ship the product, but you want to ship the things that you have more confidence and understanding versus not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):
So I think a big takeaway here is if you want to have more impact, move faster, try to spend a little more time understanding the problems you're going after in the opportunity space.

Bangaly Kaba (00:39:40):
That's right. Right. I'll give you a very tactical example is when I joined Instagram in January 2016, believe it or not, the onboarding, the sign-up flow at Instagram had literally no logging to it. It had logging of how many people started and how many people ended. Right. And I joined in January and it was like we had to write a roadmap. And so the roadmap looked like this. Okay, we know this amount at the top of the funnel and this amount at the bottom end of the funnel. And there was eight steps in the funnel and we don't know what is going on. Right. So the first bit of understand work was we needed to do the instrumentation of that funnel as fast as possible to get the data to figure out where the drops were happening and what to fix. But because we knew of what was happening at the top of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel, we can go and play around with the experience and see what was broken.

(00:40:32):
So we ran a bunch of tests of stuff that was obviously broken to see what would improve. Right. And so it was like a mix. And so what we did was we set up time where we did, the beginning of like the first couple of weeks, add the logging, ship it to code, re-evaluate in the middle of the quarter, look at the full funnel and then add more things that we can do later on once we got that. But in order to get that done, that involved understand work with growth marketing to figure out what was the schemas for the instrumentation, right, the engineering to actually do that logging. Right. Data science to like pull together funnels and dashboard it, all of that had to come together all at one time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):
I really like just this concept of calling it understand work. I think that alone is a powerful tool because we're going to spend more time on understand work.

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00):
The goal of your Kindle strategies, these like non-scalable hacks, they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users.

Lenny (00:12):
Pinterest, Airbnb, Reddit, Canva, Hipcamp, Thumbtack, Fair, Tinder, Eventbrite. What do these companies have in common? Casey Winters, Casey has worked with and advised more consumer companies on their product and growth strategy than anyone in the world. He's also very generous with his time and often sets time aside to help founders and product leaders. I always learned so much talking to Casey, and I'm excited for you to hear this episode. In our chat we covered Casey's advice on making trade offs as a product leader, justifying non-sexy product investments, the spectrum of product people and how to level up your skills, new growth trends and tactics that he's seeing, when to focus on growth, and a bunch of advice on growth strategy, and so many other things. As a bonus, we're going to be doing a live AMA with Casey in my newsletter Slack community on August 5th at 10:00 AM Pacific time, so if you'd like to ask Casey any questions, make sure to get there. Until then enjoy this episode with Casey Winters. Hey Casey Winters, what do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (01:19):
Coda's a company that's actually near and dear to my heart because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create LKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it, so they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (01:56):
I actually use Coda myself every day, it's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, to organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners of this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement, just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

(02:22):

(03:26):
Casey, welcome to the pod. I feel like every time that we chat, I leave with at least one new perspective that kind of blew my mind on product, or growth, or even just the world. And so I'm really excited to have this conversation mostly to selfishly extract as much knowledge out of your head as I can in the hour that we have together. And so with that welcome.

Casey Winters (03:50):
Very kind, happy to be here.

Lenny (03:52):
You've worked at so many iconic companies and worked with so many iconic companies. It almost boggles the mind just looking at your LinkedIn, trying to scroll through LinkedIn and you have to click on, see additional experiences. And there's just so many places you've worked, so many companies you've worked with. Could you just give listeners maybe a 10,000 foot view of your career arc through product and growth?

Casey Winters (04:15):
Well, I started my career as an analyst at apartments.com on the marketing side, so it was my job to measure every channel for effectiveness in driving leads. These are things like SEO, AdWords, affiliate marketing email, so once I got good at measuring that I naturally started working on optimizing those channels directly. And then I started going to do user research and understand how the product could be better so that we could convert leads better. And it was at that point that I got the feedback from the company that I was this weird marketing and product hybrid, and they didn't really know what to do with that, because those were two totally separate departments. It wasn't until I got to GrubHub and I was the 15th employee and they were like, dude, we don't care.

(05:01):
As long as you grow how many people order food, I don't care if you work on marketing, I don't care if you change the product, do whatever we'll have results. And we now call these roles growth, but that term didn't exist at the time, so I basically worked on growing the demand side of that business from Series A to IPO. We ended up creating a product management function out of my team there, but for the first four years we didn't have product titles either. That was kind of a newer idea, also. It wasn't until I went to Pinterest that I was actually formally labeled a product person.

(05:37):
I ended up leading the growth product team there. We basically had to rebuild the growth model of the business to reignite growth, so I was there from 40 million MAU to 150 million MAU. And it was around that time that I started doing some more advising with Airbnb on the demand side, with Pocket. And then I went to a VC named Greylock Partners and worked with their companies on growth and scaling. And then I just independently started working as a full-time advisor with companies like Eventbrite, Tinder, Thumbtack, Canva. And after doing that for a couple years, Eventbrite opened this chief product officer role and they asked me to take it, so now I've been doing that for three years now.

Lenny (06:18):
That's an excellent segue to our next little segment that I want to get into, which is partly your CPO role and the work that you do there. And also touching a bit on a bit of the writing that you've done. You're currently a chief product officer at Eventbrite, which is a company that I love, I have so many friends there and they're all amazing, such a big fan of the company. And I know a lot of listeners are maybe thinking about becoming CPO someday as a goal.

Casey Winters (06:18):
Yep.

Lenny (06:43):
And so I thought it'd be cool to chat through some of the challenges that you're having and some of the things you've learned in the role.

Casey Winters (06:49):
Sure.

Lenny (06:50):
Cool.

Casey Winters (06:50):
Yeah.

Lenny (06:51):
I'll be more specific, so one of the things that you mentioned that you're working on is thinking about trade offs and being very explicit about trade offs you're making, communicating why you made certain trade offs and then just generally communicating that upward to executives and then across the company, so I'm curious just to hear what you've learned around how to communicate trade offs and internal communication?

Casey Winters (07:11):
Yeah, one of the things I found, especially during the pandemic at Eventbrite, where we weren't obviously hiring a lot of people and we had lots of various issues come up, is that a lot of managers and leaders would just try to deal with issues on their own and not raise them or escalate them with me in particular. And some of these were really tough situations, so then later on, I'd ask why something went wrong or why we didn't achieve a goal. And I get some feedback from my team of like, Hey, you don't understand the situation. This is really impossible. There's all these things going wrong. And then I respond. Yeah, of course I don't understand this situation because you haven't told me about it. How am I supposed to evaluate things fairly if you don't let me know what's really going on, so these people on my team thought that being a leader was handling it the best they could given the circumstances when in many cases the right way is to escalate the issue so that perhaps I could help them change the circumstances, so the circumstances aren't as dire.

(08:14):
And if I can't change the circumstances, I'm at least aware of the circumstances and the explicit trade off we've made to deal with that situation. And then I can help communicate that better to others across the company, and I can help evaluate the results with the proper context and do it more fairly. I find that in general people just way under communicate upward inside of companies. And then they'll complain that executives are out of touch when they aren't telling executives what the executives need to know. Then when people inside a company do try to communicate upward a lot of times they're so in the weeds that as an executive, I just don't understand what they're saying. And then when I ask questions it's like as an exec, I'm asking a question in another language. It's like I don't know if you've ever seen Ocean's Twelve, but as a joke, they invite Matt Damon to this business meeting and they just talk in code as a prank on him.

(09:14):
And that's what a lot of people on my team feel sometimes when they're talking to the executives of like, I don't even understand what these questions mean. It's like you're speaking another language. One of the ways I try to frame it to my team is if you're not an executive, whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one, which is what part of the company strategy are you working on? What metrics are you trying to improve? What assumptions are you making that are guiding what you're building? And I find that many times when non-executives are presenting to execs, they'll start on like chapter six, so even if that part of the story is right, it's like a good story. You haven't earned the right to tell that part of the story yet because you skipped the first five chapters. And I've definitely seen people with the opposite problem as well, which I call starting at the beginning of the time where you come into a meeting with the CEO or with the CFO or something.

(10:20):
And you basically spend the first 20 minutes, re-explaining the company strategy or who our customer is or something that everyone already knows. And then by the time you get to explaining new information, you've used up your allotted time, so I try to coach my team to be in the middle. Like don't start on chapter six of the story, but also don't start with a textbook on the English language either. You want to find the last point in your story, that would be completely obvious to the person you're telling the story to, and then go from there to things that would be less obvious, but that they can follow along with. And it's a lot of work to really dial that in across different types of people you're trying to communicate that story to because of course, upward communication isn't all that you're doing, right? You're trying to communicate that down to your team, to individual engineers and designers, and they're going to need to hear some very different things then say the CPO of the company, or the CEO of the company, so it's a challenge I see quite frequently.

Lenny (11:19):
Can you talk a bit about how you actually coach PMs on this? Is this like in one-on-ones you revisit a presentation they gave that could have been better? Is it after a presentation, you pull them aside and talk through what they could have done better. How do you approach that?

Casey Winters (11:33):
Well, I think the best way to coach is actually to do it before the meeting, so I think there's a tendency in product management and product design to want to do meetings where there's kind of this big reveal and an aha to the audience. And it's kind of the opposite of how you want to handle most of these situations. You want to de-risk that meeting not make it a big success or fail moment, so there's a few things that I do. One is if there is a big presentation coming up or something like that, I try to run through it with the team, pretending to be the other members of the audience that are going to be there, so I'll say, okay, well, what the CFO's going to ask about here is X. And you want to answer that question before it gets asked. What Julia, our CEO is going to ask about is why, so you want to weave that into the early story and not wait for her to ask.

(12:28):
You kind of role play the entire thing based on the different people that they're going to be communicating with. Something I commonly say is that executive communication is actually executives communication. You're communicating with individual executives that all have different styles and different concerns about the business or about the particular problem you're working on. And you want to anticipate that, and if you don't have enough experience say presenting to the CFO or the CEO, I as the chief product officer do, so I can impersonate them and help you understand what they're going to care most about. The other thing that I push a lot of my team to do is have pre-meetings with some of those key individuals, so that they're going to be less surprised in the meeting about what you're talking about, that you've gotten any major concerns brought to your attention before the big meeting.

(13:18):
And that helps de-risk how poorly a meeting like that can go, so definitely at the individual presentation level, doing that pre-meeting. What I'm working on a lot now is trying to have more of a scaled approach to training this type of upward communication. And what types of frameworks, what types of structure tend to work for Eventbrite and making sure that everyone on my team is just really well versed in that and comfortable in it because of course, confidence projection is a key part of these types of meetings as well.

Lenny (13:54):
This is such important advice that I think a lot of PMs don't recognize how important it is to prepare for important meetings like this. Just to give folks context, maybe that aren't doing this sort of thing when they're working at a larger company, how much time do you spend or an ICPM should spend on preparing for these things just to set a little bit of a reference point?

Casey Winters (14:13):
Well, it's an interesting question because I think different people have different styles on how they want to handle this. I'd say the way my brain works in these situations which I think is a little bit atypical, is I'm actually a little bit better if I am free forming a lot of elements and just speaking from confidence in areas I know versus specifically trying to lay out every exact bullet point I want to hit. I'm going to show up as more comfortable, I'm going to show up as more dynamic, and I'm going to be able to engage in a more thoughtful conversation, so for me, my approach to these sorts of things is I write a lot. I write a lot of notes. I write a lot of documents. And then in general, for any of these types of communications, I am just pulling from things I know deeply because I've written them down, I've thought a lot about them.

(15:10):
For a lot of other people they really just need to spend a lot of time on prep to make sure they nail the communication they want to nail. And I found it requires a different amount of investment for different people on my team, so the point is not as much how much time you spend, it's how well do you really know the material, and how well do you really know what your audience is going to care about with that material so that you are prepared for every question you might get. I'll give an example from my Pinterest days, the primary way with which you interfaced on any key strategic topic was product review, right? You'd go in and you talk to Ben, our CEO and Jack our head of product. And Ben and Jack had very different styles of communication. Jack in particular would very early on ask a few different data questions to get context on the problem. And if you, as a product leader or an individual PM or an individual designer didn't know the answers to any of those, it cast doubt on the entire rest of that meeting.

(16:17):
Because, the team wouldn't be confident that you had all the right context to understand the problem, so a lot of what I would coach my team on is, okay, I'm pretty confident Jack's going to ask this question, then this question, then this question. Based on the material I'm seeing from you, how well are you prepared to answer those questions? Different execs might be somewhat different in that regard, but if you haven't thought through all the questions that might be asked from the document that you're sharing or the presentation you're about to present, you're not prepared enough, right. You need to know the entire universe of how that meeting can go. And that may take you dozens of hours, it might take you three hours, but the most important thing is that you've asked what possible questions can be asked and am I prepared to answer all of those? Do I have all the data in front of me to answer all of those? But because if I don't the chances of the meeting you're having a negative outcome just increased dramatically.

Lenny (17:17):
I imagine some people are listening to this and they're like, holy shit, I need to spend this much time on preparing for meetings like this, but in my experience, that's exactly what you do need to do to be successful. And so this is real good, real talk about how long it takes to prepare for important meetings like the ones you're talking about.

Casey Winters (17:33):
Absolutely. I mean, for better or worse, the way that a lot of key decisions are made inside companies are through these types of forums and meetings. And it's an extremely high leverage piece of time for a product manager or a product designer in terms of how much impact they can have. And if you are under preparing for those sorts of things, the chances of you being able to have the type of impact you want, to have the type of career growth you want just go down dramatically. And I'm sure, you and I have definitely made mistakes in our career in important meetings in the past, but I think one of the things that I really try to do is learn from each one of those and make sure those types of issues wouldn't happen again. And now I feel like I have a pulse on, I know if I haven't done the work going into a meeting, that's going to make it have a more negative result.

(18:26):
And now I'm pretty accurate. And look sometimes you just didn't have enough time and it is what it is. But now I know, okay, I know I'm not quite prepared for this and it can go poorly as a result. And I know also when I've done the right prep and I'm ready for anything, whether it's a board meeting, or a meeting with the executive team, or a meeting with an external partner, right? And I think that's what you're trying to build as any sort of product leader, or PM, or product designer, or researcher, is that intuition of like I'm ready for this, I know everything that's going to come at me, I'm prepared for any eventual outcome. And if you're not, then probably the answer is spend more time to get ready.

Lenny (19:09):
Speaking of spending more time, another topic that you shared with me that you're thinking a lot about as a CPO is keeping the Eventbrite product simple while adding more and more functionality to make it more usable by more people and more use cases. And so I'd love to hear how you're approaching that because I know that's something every single product faces eventually assuming they keep growing, and survive, and keep adding more power.

Casey Winters (19:34):
Yeah, Scott Belsky who's the chief product officer of Adobe. He has this concept of the product life cycle you're probably familiar with, but I'll explain it to your listeners, which is users flock to a simple product. The product takes users for granted and adds more features for power users and then users flock to the next simple product as a result. And I've done a lot of research and work on this problem. And I found that there are a few different design hacks, essentially that companies use to try to avoid this cycle. One is okay if you build out more complex functionality, un-bundle it over time, like Facebook Messenger, Uber Eats have done, right? At Pinterest, we did a heavy investment in progressive disclosure, which is let's hide a lot of the more complex functionality until we make sure our users learn the really critical functionality. And then we can open up more of the full suite of the product.

(20:34):
Then there's just proactive training. You can get on a video call with your customers or a phone call, much more common in enterprise, obviously, or you might have a custom UI that goes away over time. That's giving you the training wheels. You can also segment experiences based on different user types, so certain users might get a very simple user experience and then some users might get the more complex one, and there's different packages and interfaces that cleanly separate the two, maybe that more complex experience also bundles in training. What I found is that just none of these really worked that well for the Eventbrite scenario, because we have different types of event creators across every possible level of complexity and sophistication. We have people that are putting on their first event and they expect five people to show up. We have people putting on a hundred events per year that really know what they're doing.

(21:32):
And then users also shift from one of those categories to another over time. They can get more sophisticated as they build up their business, so segmentation doesn't really work that well. Progressive disclosure doesn't work that well either because in many of these cases, we never want certain types of users to find the more advanced stuff, it's just going to confuse them. We strive for this concept of what we call perceived simplicity, which is there are advanced features in the product and they are easily discoverable when you look for them, but they're effectively hidden if you're not looking for them. And of course the majority of users aren't going to ever look for them, so the advanced more complex areas of the product don't make the product harder to use for the majority who will never need that level of complexity. And there are areas where we do this well and areas where we're still working on getting better, but that's really our aspiration.

(22:26):
The company that I feel like has always done the best job of this is WhatsApp, where at its core, it's a chat app and it's really good at being a chat app. But I remember when I went to Brazil, all of a sudden I started receiving voice messages and it was really easy to figure out how to use them and how to do them myself. When I needed to learn how to do video calls or phone calls, it would take less than a second to figure out how to use the more advanced stuff, but it's effectively kind of hidden if you're not looking for it. That's what we aspire to at Eventbrite. And in some cases we're doing well. And in some cases, we definitely have some work to do.

Lenny (22:59):
Is there an example of a win in that direction in the Eventbrite product that you're proud of using this model or even something that's like, oh man, this is really broken?

Casey Winters (23:08):
Yeah, we've definitely had some wins here on the marketing side of our products, so one of the bigger investments we've made recently is our creators do a lot of their own marketing to try to get people to come to their events and transact on Eventbrite in the process. But our event creators, they're not professional marketers, they try to figure these tools out, so we built a product that allows them to automate their Facebook advertising to get better results, supercharged by our data. And the product's working really well, but we found is that there are certain segments that, I want to geek out on this a little bit, right.

(23:47):
They want to figure out all the different target segments and optimize their creative, and then there are many creators who just want it done for them. We've been able to build some interfaces where the default is super simple, we'll handle the targeting for you, we'll handle the creative and then, Hey, here's an on-ramp if you want to get a little bit more sophisticated and do more of this yourself, so that's an area where I wouldn't say we've perfected it, but we've now really understood those different types of users and a have easy pass for both of them to be successful, so I'm really happy with that.

Lenny (24:22):
Awesome. Another topic that you wrote about that kind of touches on the stuff we were just talking about is justify non-sexy product improvements, things like stability, performance, developer velocity, things that as a PM leader, you're just like, no, no, no, let's just... The default is let's do that later, we got to hit our fricking metrics, we've got to drive growth. And you had some really interesting insights on how you think about justifying these sorts of things. And so I'd love to hear that from you?

Casey Winters (24:49):
The idea is that some of the most impactful projects that product teams can work on at scale, not early stage startups per se, but at scale are the hardest to measure. And because of that, they just get chronically underfunded. It's that old adage, what gets measured gets managed, right? For things like user experience, or performance, or developer velocity, or just a product area that's deemed un-sexy, like growth used to be back in the day, I walk through some examples of a few tactics that work to get around this problem, building custom metrics to show the value, being able to run small tests that prove the worthwhile-ness of the investment, creating some team principles that make sure you don't ever kind of forget about these important elements that can hurt you in the long run. And also just how to use experiments to build buy-in at the broader level.

(25:41):
And one of the main takeaways besides some of those tactics in being successful here is that you have to get a team to buy-in to this. You can't really do a lot of this work alone, right? If you're a PM, you want to be approaching this from a well, my engineering manager and my design leader also bought in that we need to work on performance or we've all aligned that the user experience is not going in quite the direction we want, and we want to head some problems off that may not improve metrics today, but could certainly decline metrics tomorrow. And if you can get a small team, what two, three people aligned on the importance of something that's deemed un-sexy. It's a lot easier to start to build this game plan around metrics or running small tests or structuring OKRs to not only prioritize this work, but to show some really massive impact. Which could then get the rest of the company much more excited to make investments themselves.

Lenny (26:48):
What I'm hearing is step one is just get your kind of peer leaders aligned behind something that may not obviously be something your leaders want you to do, is that right?

Casey Winters (26:59):
Absolutely, yep.

Lenny (27:01):
This episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I asked product managers and designers on Twitter, what software do they use most? Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, white boarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs. And that includes thousands of built in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer, visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up, that's whimsical.com/lenny.

(27:47):
Is there anything else that you think is really valuable, powerful, effective in just getting folks to getting your leaders to basically go along with some that maybe isn't going to move metrics or is that the core of it?

Casey Winters (27:57):
Well, yeah. I mean, definitely it's hard when you can't create a metric that they can understand. I think the other area to think about is when you're an early stage company, everything you're doing is trying to drive upside, like trying to drive growth in some way, it could be short term or long term, but you're trying to drive real growth for the business. But then when you've actually built a real business, a lot of times people are still in that same mode, which is everything is trying to add more growth on top of what we've already got. But when you're at scale, you can actually lose what you've built, so trying to help whether it's executives or just your manager, understand that this thing we've got, whether it's a high conversion rate or good engagement on this feature, it could go away if we don't do these other things.

(28:48):
And here's what it would look like if that goes away, that can be incredibly powerful. I think we were fortunate at Pinterest in this regard, in that we were a fast growing startup that stopped growing due to some changes in the market related to Facebook. And then actually once we had switched to growing primarily through SEO, there was an algorithm change that severely impacted our growth at one point in time, so that helped the company build more intuition of like we're not guaranteed the gains from all the things we've built in the past. We need to do things to protect them and protecting what we've got actually is increasingly important once you build scale, because now you've built something really valuable already. And yes, we want to make it more valuable of course, but it's hard to make it more valuable if you're eroding some of the gains you've already built, so that's another element that I think can be pretty impactful.

Lenny (29:41):
In your post on this topic you have an awesome chart of product market fit over time, illustrating the point you just made that it doesn't last and you have to keep iterating to keep your product market fit like you're by default falling behind if you're not continuing to push there, right?

Casey Winters (29:54):
Yeah. I think the concept is user expectations just continue to go up every day in terms of their expectations on user experience, on the value that they expect your product to provide, but also the competitive landscape in the market continues to get better. Yeah, if you're not continually pushing to make your product better, your user experience better, your latency better, then you're eventually not necessarily tomorrow, but maybe in a year, maybe in five years, you might find yourself fall out of product market fit entirely. And that's a really dangerous place to be, because then it's going to take a long time to figure that out and make adjustments. And then you probably have more technical debt to clean up, to be able to get back to where you need to be, where the market has reached in terms of expectations, so just doing work to make sure you never get in that situation is extremely valuable, in my opinion. It's something that I think a lot of teams forget about.

Lenny (30:54):
I think you're going to create nightmares for a lot of founders listening to this right now.

Casey Winters (30:59):
That's not the intention, but-

Lenny (31:02):
No, it's a kick in the butt. Another post that I definitely wanted to chat about. Maybe your SPST post, maybe I'm curious if there are others is around operations team, product ops and generally ops people.

Casey Winters (31:12):
Yep.

Lenny (31:13):
And this point that you made that ops is often a sign of inefficiency on a product team because in theory, a lot of the roles should be done by software, eventually. I'd love to unpack this and hear your take on this?

Casey Winters (31:26):
I think I originally got the idea for the post in that I had written another essay on MarTech. And how MarTech to be really successful, it's really got a target engineers more so than marketers. And that a lot of MarTech businesses just aren't very good businesses. And I think I got an invite to speak at a MarTech conference to a bunch of marketers about this post. And it's like, well, that sounds like a terrible idea. I'm basically telling a bunch of marketers that what they're investing in isn't that important, and that they're not the most important target customer. And I remember reading something about the conference that was like a conference for the growth of the marketing operations professional. And then I was like, oh no, that's not what I want in the industry at all. Like having marketing ops means you suck at marketing.

(32:18):
And obviously that's a bit of hyperbole. I'm not against the concept of a marketing ops role or a product ops role, we have a product ops team at Eventbrite, but as someone who ran a double digit million marketing budget at GrubHub without marketing ops, because we invested in automation and we invested in process, it scares me when the first tactic people go to is to add people to help scale. There's nothing wrong with people obviously, there's nothing wrong with operations people. The thing I have a problem with is normalizing ops as a distinct stable function where operations rules are amazing and how we utilize them at Eventbrite is their explicit job is to go find inefficiencies and build process or software to root out that inefficiency, so then they can go find other places to be more valuable. When you say, oh, their job is to do this manual process long term.

(33:16):
That's where I get super concerned because you're not rooting out efficiency in how you build your company. And that's where I feel like a lot of this can go if you're not careful, Intercom has a really good blog post on this from a while back around their business operations team. And they basically up front in that post say the goal of business operations is to not exist, and I definitely very much agree with that. I think in general functional ops roles, whether it's product ops or marketing ops or whatever, they're a hack to deal with some sort of functional issue on your team. And it's totally okay to have functional issues. Startups are going to have functional issues all over the place, but if the way they deal with that functional issue is by building larger and larger operations teams and roles. That's basically exacerbating an inefficiency issue, a functional issue, it's not fixing it. It's a form of empire building and in general empire building is something I don't have a lot of tolerance for.

(34:16):
You're making more of a function unable to operate without human intervention by saying the goal is to scale up marketing ops or product ops. Whereas what the goal should be is let's use our brains to run experiments, to make us more functional with less people. We're more efficient, we could add more value to the customer, and to the business. And if that means I don't actually need to have this product operations job in a year. That's awesome. And guess what, if you've shown you've done a really great job at rooting out inefficiencies. Every part of the company's going to want you to do some other job if that job is no longer valuable, because you've done such good job eliminating the need for it. There isn't this real concern that I'm going to lose my job by being too effective at it. It's like, no, you're going to show that you're just awesome at many types of jobs that product leaders or marketing leaders care about, so that's my perspective.

Lenny (35:09):
I love that. And this happened a lot at Airbnb, a lot of amazing office people ended up moving into other roles once the role was not necessary or they just wanted to do something else. And clearly people wanted them on their team because they were killing it.

Casey Winters (35:20):
Indeed.

Lenny (35:21):
One last question about the CPO role, and then I want to shift a bit to just product management and growth. What is the job of a CPO for folks that are just like, what the heck, what is this thing? What do you do all day?

Casey Winters (35:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (35:32):
And then what does it take to get there? Just like what should people work on most if they're trying to get to CPO someday?

Casey Winters (35:39):
First off, when you think about what's the job, the way I think about it is I'm responsible for leading and facilitating the development of products and features that deliver value for Eventbrite's customers that will translate into value for the business. And each of those words were chosen pretty carefully. Now in terms of the scope of the function, a CPO role can lead a few different sub-functions. In my case, I lead product management, product design, research, and growth marketing, but different roles have kind of some or not as many of those, it can be pretty custom depending on the size of the company and what the leader's skill sets are. To talk a little bit more depth about the role. I think it's my job to make sure Eventbrite chooses the best possible product strategy based on the information we have, that we can adjust that strategy as we learn and continue to build that feedback loop.

(36:35):
It's also my job to define and consistently improve the process through which we set our product strategy, how we prioritize projects, how we execute on them to make sure we're delivering that value to our customers, we're delivering those tangible business results. And to do that in a way where the rest of the company understands it and is able to participate in it as well, so this is things like identifying bottlenecks that prevent us from delivering value, or quality, or doing that at the detriment of speed, working with people across the company to remove those bottlenecks, making sure people outside of development are aware of what we're building, participating in the development and feedback of what we're building, as well as in helping deliver that for like a GTM perspective. And last but not least, and we've talked a little bit about this earlier, training the team on what it means to be an effective product manager, product designer, user research, et cetera, at Eventbrite.

(37:36):
And then of course hiring people who can augment our existing team on everything I just mentioned, so I'm accountable for what we build driving value for the business. And there's of course going to be many times where what we build doesn't end up driving value. It's hard to predict sometimes, but it's my job to improve that conversion rate and the magnitude of impact over time. It might not be that everything we build delivers value, but I want most of it to, and I want the impact of that value to be higher and higher over time. You also asked about what it takes to get to the CPO role. And I think my journey's been more irregular than most of the people you probably talk to. Product management when I started my career, it was all a waterfall. It was built around massive releases, it was a totally different job from what we do now. Marketing was a lot more agile in the lowercase sense of agile and it mapped to my mind better as someone who's really influenced by the book, The Goal.

(38:40):
I think the tangible pieces of advice to get to this level that may be helpful is I always focused on where I thought there was leverage. I wanted to learn everything I could and focus on the things that had a big impact regardless of the org structure or the career path that meant, I wanted to really have a deep understanding of the entire business so I knew just what was worth focusing on to help the business. I think one of the things that's different about being a chief product officer versus other product roles is how much of a company leadership role it is versus a functional leadership role. You're expected in this role to optimize for the entire company, even at the expense of what's good for your team, so you really have to learn how to optimize for company first. That's like a key thing to learn that I think new executives can struggle with. And what advantage I think I had is I've basically been working with executives since my first job at apartments.com, so I learned to speak their language and understood what they cared about pretty early in my career.

(39:47):
And this is a really important element, assume that questions from them are them trying to learn versus them assuming you don't know something and testing you about it. I find that a lot of people get intimidated by executive questions when the executive is just trying to understand things. And then that changes the interaction you can have. The other element that served me well was just refusing to specialize. I thought if I could learn all the skills that would allow me to combine them to work on the most important things versus only work on the thing I knew how to work on. And that definitely led to slower visible progress in terms of career growth or titles, but it was a much faster path to the true executive role because I could speak better with CEOs about more topics than most of my peers. Obviously this is all my individual experience there are many paths to get to this type of level, but those are some things that have worked for me.

Lenny (40:45):
That was such an incredible definition and so much good advice there. And this is a good segue to another area that you have a really interesting insight on around the spectrum of product people. When I think of you, I think of two by twos and this is I think just a spectrum, which is unusual for Casey framework.

Casey Winters (41:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (41:01):
I'd love to hear your take on how you think about the spectrum and around up-scaling PMs to move along that spectrum?

Casey Winters (41:06):
The idea is, and this is something I was inspired from talking with Omar who runs product at Cambly. He used to run core product at Pinterest. It's this idea of any product team is like a gang of misfits, they all come from different backgrounds. Most people didn't start as a product manager, their first job, they might have been in sales, or in marketing, or analytics, or engineering, right. Everyone's bringing these different skill sets to the table. But the main spectrum that I've observed in product teams of any decent size is that you have two extreme types of product managers per se, and on perhaps the left side of the spectrum you have the crazy innovator types, they have so many different ideas, they pay attention to every single change in the industry, they all know all about the latest Apple API or Snapchat's latest product feature.

(42:06):
Those people are going to have ideas all the time. Actually, probably most of those ideas are going to be bad, but one out of ten's going to be just a game changer and they're generally not super great at turning that idea into action. And then on the extreme right side of the spectrum will be your typical executional focused PM, and they can do a really good job of taking a strong strategy and turning it into action that creates value for the customer, but they generally don't know what's going on in the industry. They can't think of a totally new product idea themselves. They're going to need support from above to be able to push them in the right direction and then they got it from there. When you think about recruiting, what we all want as CPOs in terms of people we bring into our team is we want people in the middle. We want people who are strategic, they understand what's going on in the industry, they can generate some good ideas, but they can also turn it into something real that delivers value for the customer and the company.

(43:08):
And there just aren't a ton of those people in the world. Not as many as we would like to recruit, so as a product leader, if I'm airing on the side of which side of the spectrum I want people from, I generally will take people who are good at execution over people who are good at generating ideas, because of course there's always too many good ideas that a company need to focus and execute well on the best ones. Whereas if I were a VC, I would probably bias to the people on the left because I don't need every company to work. If I invest in 10 different entrepreneurs who have crazy ideas and one of them works and becomes the next Airbnb, turns out I've done incredibly well as a venture capitalist. The challenge you practically deal with as a product leader is you end up recruiting, and managing, and growing a lot of executional people who can get stuff done, but if they want to get to the director level or if they want to get to my level, they need to get more strategic.

(44:06):
And we don't have good ways to turn great executors into great strategists as in general, like a product function, so I've started investing in a lot of different things here. Obviously I've built some programs for Reforge around product strategy. A lot of my team goes to those to try to learn. I've also been doing a lot of mentorship with the team to try to teach them what it looks like to do that well. I've had people come in to speak with the team like you and many other great product folks to show my team what great looks like and how people like you developed your skills. And I'm trying lots of different things to try to move more of the team to the middle, where they can be that optimal strategist that still retains that ability to deliver great value on top of the strategy versus just have ideas that can't be executed on. And it's definitely a work in progress, it's a lot of different tactics to try to build that skill set inside the team and scale it. And definitely something I feel like I'm still working on.

Lenny (45:11):
What I'm hearing is a lot of kind of the biggest upside for PMs to develop is basically to become more strategic and all the things you've shared are just ways or a lot of ways to just become better at strategies. It's interesting that that's like what you found to be the most essential piece for PMs to often level up at.

Casey Winters (45:30):
Like you said, it depends on the level, right. Early on in your career as a PM, you're going to get the most value by showing that you can ship real things to customers and that the customers like them, like that's by far the most important thing. But if you want to start managing groups of PMs, if you want to start a running a business unit, or a pillar, or a theme. I as a chief product officer, I'm going to expect you to be able to write that strategy doc without me. And you know what I found, whether it's through the advising roles or through coming into Eventbrite is just a lot of people couldn't do that step.

(46:04):
And that means when you try to become a product leader at the company and the CEO expects that from you and you can't do it, you're going to set yourself up to really cap hard on how fast your career can grow. And you'll get stuck, whether it's at the senior product manager level or at the group PM level, because you can't show that you can drive decision making on your own and that you can push forward new ideas that are going to help the company, so that's definitely where I've seen the biggest bottleneck in terms of skill sets. Obviously there's lots of important skill sets you want to build as a PM, but that one to get to the top is the great filter.

Lenny (46:40):
That's awesome advice for folks listening that are trying to figure out what should I work on? It's kind of simple a lot of times just get better at strategy and it feels like it elevates you in so many other ways.

Casey Winters (46:49):
Yeah, and of course we could talk for hours about what it means to get better at strategy and some of the tactics there.

Lenny (46:54):
It could be a follow up.

Casey Winters (46:56):
Because I know some PMs who struggle with that.

Lenny (46:56):
Follow up.

Casey Winters (46:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (46:58):
Okay.

Casey Winters (46:59):
Podcast number two.

Lenny (46:59):
Podcast number two, let's book it. Okay, so I can't let you go without talking about growth. Everyone's always trying to figure out how do we grow our company?

Casey Winters (46:59):
Right.

Lenny (47:07):
What can we do to accelerate growth? I know you're modest, but I think you're one of the smartest people in the world on this stuff. And so I just want to touch on a couple things in the time that we have here. One is with paid growth becoming increasingly more expensive and difficult, especially with Apple's recent changes.

Casey Winters (47:24):
Yep.

Lenny (47:24):
SEO forever becoming more crowded, sales being always expensive. It's just tough out there for a lot of startups to grow. Are you seeing any interesting or new growth channels or tactics that folks can explore or consider that maybe work for companies that you're looking at?

Casey Winters (47:43):
It's not that there are new channels per se, unless you include tokens from like Web3, which I do not. It's more that there are ways to get leverage on your channels through better flows or lifetime value that companies are figuring out. For example, at Eventbrite, we unified what we're separate direct response and lead generation flows in our performance marketing to acquire creators. And now it just takes less effort, we're getting better CPAs and sales now has the opportunity to pick up any product qualified lead from a direct response customer who may need a little bit more help, and they have the data to now determine if there's high enough value to justify it.

(48:27):
This concept is being dubbed, product led sales. And it's this idea that you can unify self-service loops in a B2B business, which are typically driven by product and your sales loops into one more complex giant loop that operates more efficiently and breaks down the silos. And I think you're going to see an explosion in B2B companies that learn how to unlock that and get sales, and product, and marketing to be working as one larger cross-functional team and building an engine that optimizes all of their skill sets, so that's something I'm pretty excited about, but we're definitely in the early days there.

Lenny (49:02):
That's awesome. I was going to ask you if there's any trends you're seeing around growth and clearly that's one. Are there any other trends, just things happening in the growth world?

Casey Winters (49:12):
Yeah, sure. I think there was this conventional wisdom to just focus on building until you found product market fit and then you can worry about growth. And of course there's some truth in that statement, but now as I'm talking with more and more founders and I'm sure you're seeing this yourself, is we're seeing founders who are thinking about building growth loops into their product before they find product market fit. And it's not so that they can prematurely scale before they have product market fit. It's so that when they find product market fit, they have that built in distribution advantage to grow once they're ready. And founders are starting to intuit what I've written about a bit as well as you, which is that scalable acquisition or what we call an acquisition loop is a requirement for product market fit.

(49:59):
Like if you got a product that retains well and you can't find more users for it, I don't think that's product market fit, so it's really exciting to see that evolution and to see founders think about like it's not about getting a bunch of users before you have a product that works. It's about thinking strategically about how this product's going to grow itself when it's ready to do so. I'm really excited to see the next generation of founders build that muscle early on and also leverage it when they're ready instead of just like, oh, I'm going to throw a bunch of paid ads at it and it's going to work, so that's something I'm really excited about.

# Lessons from scaling Stripe | Claire Hughes Johnson (ex-COO of Stripe)

## Transcript

Claire Hughes Johnson (00:00:00):
What I say to people at Stripe... In our onboarding, I used to run a session. I was like, "If you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you. And I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to like slow the whole company down. Follow a process and get it done, and don't forget to actually make a decision. And if you don't know who the decision maker is and you're worried it's not, you just ask. Don't get stuck." Too many people get stuck and it makes your work terrible, right? What do we all care about? Progress, impact, momentum. If anything I would say about advice to people generally is be a force for positive momentum and it will be actually a real career maker.
Lenny (00:00:50):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Claire Hughes Johnson. Claire was most recently chief operating officer at Stripe for the past seven years, where she helped scale them from a small startup to the legendary company that it is today. Before that, she spent about 10 years at Google where she was VP of self-driving cars, VP of global online sales, director of sales and ops for Gmail, YouTube, Google Apps, and AdWords. Before that, she was in politics. She's also on the board of HubSpot and the Atlantic. And this week, she's releasing an incredible book called Scaling People, which in my opinion should be and likely will be on every founder's bookshelf. In our conversation, we dig into many of the meaty topics that her book covers, including building your operational cadence, defining your company and personal operating principles, your company's operating system.
(00:01:46):
Also, tons of tactical advice around saying things that you cannot say, building self-awareness, distinguishing management from leadership, so much more. I say this a couple times in our conversation. If you enjoyed my newsletter and podcast and the fact that it's very tactical and full of templates and frameworks, you'll love Claire's book, and you'll love learning from Claire. I had such a good time chatting with Claire, and I know you'll learn a lot from this conversation. With that, I bring you Claire Hughes Johnson after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or are you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies.
(00:04:18):
Use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to vanta.com/lenny. That's vanta.com/lenny to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today.

Claire, welcome to the podcast.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:04:49):
Thank you, Lenny.
Lenny (00:04:51):
So you wrote this book. It's called Scaling People. It's coming out this week. I actually read a preview copy, and it's incredible. Everyone listening to this should buy it, especially if you're a fan of this podcast. It's full of frameworks and templates and guides and all these things that I try to do with my newsletter and podcast. And so if you like what I do, you're going to love this book. And I can't imagine how much work it must have taken to write a book like this. So my first question just have relieved are you that you're done with this book and you can move on with your life?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:21):
I am so relieved, Lenny. Writing this book was not my idea. Patrick and John Collison, Stripe's co-founders, really sort of pushed me into it. And I'm glad they did. I will admit that, as I am with most things they pushed me into, but it was a lot more work than I thought it would be, and it's very rewarding to have it done. Of course, though I've been re-looking at it and realizing there are things I want to add information or tweak what I originally said, but maybe we'll have to do a second edition. We'll see.
Lenny (00:05:55):
That's the benefit of a newsletter. I can just edit things and they're immediately live.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:59):
Yes.
Lenny (00:06:01):
I want to talk about John and Patrick a little bit. But before that, something I wanted to ask is I find that when I write stuff, I am able to better understand and crystallize my own thinking. And I'm curious, having written this book, what is it that you were able to better understand and crystallize in your own thinking through that process?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:06:20):
It's true, and it's funny, because if you asked me, I would've said I crystallize more by talking and speaking. But whenever I do write something down, I'm glad I did. So I probably do more crystallizing by writing than I would admit, but maybe I'm just lazy and I just like to talk. There's a part of the book, I think it's toward the end of the third chapter, which is about hiring, and that's a really long chapter. Turns out I had a lot to say about hiring and hiring leaders and processes and what you need want to set up. And as I got toward the end of the chapter, I found myself saying to the reader... You maybe have read this and thought, is she for real? You need to do all this work? You need to put all of this in? And I had to say, well, look... I started the chapter saying, if you believe that talent is everything, then your hiring process is everything.
(00:07:11):
And so yes, you do need to put that work in. But I think, Lenny, to your point, when you see all the templates and the frameworks and the examples and the advice from my career... And I was at Google for almost 11 years, I joined Google when it was about 1800 people pre IPO and left when it was about 60,000. I had eight different jobs while I was there. And then joining Stripe when it was about 160 people, and now we're over 7,000 people. Yeah, I have a lot of examples, but really what's crystallized is how much work it is to build, to build a company. You know this. And I hope this book is a bit of a shortcut, but there are no shortcuts. I hope it will accelerate people's knowledge so that they can get down to work with our product and with our customers.
Lenny (00:07:58):
There's a story you share at the end of the book, I think it's in acknowledgements, about how people went and took John Collison out for dinner and were just picking his brain, and "How did you scale Stripe? How did you build this amazing machine of a company?" And he often came back from these dinners, and he's just like, "Claire, they just want to talk to you. You did all these things, not me." And it sounds like that kind of encouraged you to write things down, and then led to this book. One, is that true? And then two, I'm curious, what else did you learn from John and Patrick Collison that have stuck with you? I imagine there's a lot, but kind of what stands out?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:08:31):
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think it is true that at Stripe, we're fortunate where we have so many users, customers who are themselves founders or interesting companies growing up around the world, whether at scale like Amazon or scaling. I've spent time with Discord and Toast and all kinds of interesting companies that are growing up around us. And a lot of their questions are not necessarily about Stripe's products always. They're really about, "Well, how do you guys do this thing?" Or "We're having this challenge. Are you having this challenge?" And John, yeah, would often come back from trips. He would travel more, and he is often probably meets with more customers than anyone in the Stripe leadership team, maybe other than our sales leaders. And they would ask about scaling, and he would joke. He's like, "We need Claire in a box." So I think the book is Claire in a box, I guess.
(00:09:23):
But Patrick also would have that same experience. And when I contributed a chapter to Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook, even though if you look at High Growth Handbook, which I also really do recommend not just because I'm in it, I'm probably the least, I don't know, celebrity participant in his chapters, and my chapter got a lot of traction because I think it was very specific. It was very tactical. And Elad actually helped me to realize, look, examples and details and frameworks, my working with Claire document is in there, is like... He said it's catnip. And I think that is also what inspired Patrick to push me to do basically a longer version of that chapter that I did with Elad. But I've learned a lot from both of them. I used to think that I was... My parents are teachers, Lenny. I used to think I was very curious, and I'm a learner and I'll seek out information.
(00:10:21):
And I grew up in a very educatory environment, right? Well, once I met the Collisons, the two of them are huge sponges, seeking out knowledge constantly. But also, anytime we were confronted with anything, even things I felt I'd done before, that I had the experience and we were going to build it, they were like, "Well, who have you talked to?" Or "What have you read?" And it was really good. I don't think I made enough phone calls in my earlier career and asked people's advice and asked for help and found the person who did that thing five years ago and found out what they learned. And I think that's probably my biggest lesson from working with both of them, is how much it pays to seek out knowledge from others because we're all just learning all the time.
Lenny (00:11:11):
Is there a story or example of that comes to mind that was really beneficial where you actually ended up follow that advice and reached out to someone, talked to someone, and that changed the way you think, changed the way you operate?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:11:21):
There are two things that just jumped into my mind. The first one is early on at Stripe... When I joined, we were about 160 people. I started bringing in some leaders. We were building out go to market, we were starting to stabilize our support operations, building out recruiting and HR, all the things. We were really growing. And it became very apparent that we needed to put in some kind of job structure. Levels and ladders is what you would call it, which is there are different levels of pay, and they have to do with your experience and your impact and their expectations of those different levels, right? There's an engineering ladder. And this stuff is probably making some people listening like their skin start to crawl because it's never fun or easy to define all that, and it's not perfect. You're immediately getting into something that feels pretty suboptimal, but it is worse to have nothing because it starts to feel very unfair in the environment, especially if you have to start to change up compensation and reward or reward systems, right?
(00:12:24):
So I realized, oh my gosh, we're going to have to put this in place. We didn't know HR people, so I basically ran a project. And the first thing I did though, thanks to Patrick and John, is I talked to Square, I talked to Airbnb, and I talked to two or three other companies. But those two conversations, I'm not going to say who said this, but one of them, the person said, "Oh, that's a blood bath." They were not encouraging about what we were about to go through. And another one said, "You know what? I'm so impressed that you're doing that so early. We waited too long." And actually, that's what a lot of my book. It's about is when should you start to think about this thing that you might need, right? And it's sooner than you think. And so putting in levels of ladders felt like ripping the off, honestly, but I was glad. One company I talked to waited until they were like 800 people, and it was apparently not fun because people don't like to be... Who likes to be categorized?
Lenny (00:13:26):
Yeah, and put it at a level that maybe they're not happy with, right? They're like, "Oh, I thought I was a lot more senior than that."
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:13:32):
Yep. Yeah, exactly. It's not easy. It's a form of change challenging. And I would not say we did it perfectly, but I'm glad we did it. I think that example was definitely one of them. Another was like we were really... We wanted to roll out 24/7 support in multiple channels, email, phone, chat in multiple languages and getting from where we were to where we wanted to be as quickly as possible. Not many companies have done at the scale, because Stripe has millions of customers. We're B2B, but we're B2B at a very high scale, which actually Google was as well. And so that was beneficial to me coming into the Stripe environment because I'd done parts of that for Google. And again, that's an example of something I thought I knew how to do, sort of, but we certainly didn't do it perfectly, and it's certainly different when you're talking about payments.
(00:14:24):
That's people's money. That is a business'... If they don't know how to contact you and they have a problem, that is a huge issue. And so I did seek out a lot of advice. And I would say... Did anything change dramatically what we did? I think if anything, the advice pushed me to go faster on some of my intuitions about, for example, using vendors and outsourcing parts of the model. And I realized we're not going to scale all this internally, especially not at the speed that we're going, but it's hard to start to use outside sort of contractors if you haven't filled figured out all your tools and processes. So that balance was sort of freaking me out, but you just got to push through it.
Lenny (00:15:15):
There's a couple directions I want to go, but I'll go in an unexpected direction. At Stripe, you're kind of infamous for your titles. When I created this career ladder document.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:24):
[inaudible 00:15:24].
Lenny (00:15:24):
Yeah, it's like everyone's product manager., They're like a VP of product potential and it's like product manager. What's the rationale behind that? I guess, and what's the benefit of that? But, we don't have to go too far down the road. I'm just curious.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:37):
So this is something that Patrick and I actually really agreed on without a lot of discussion, which is not always the case. It has to do with a combination of optionality as you scale and grow, and also culture, right? And so the minute you start titling a lot, you're signaling hierarchy and authority. And the culture piece to Stripe still today, which is I think we could use more, at least more overt trappings of structure because it can get confusing. And I'll be the first to tell you that, and I admit that this might have carried on too far. But early on, at Stripe, there's a real belief. It's not a particularly hierarchical company. And if you're the person who has the knowledge, you are the expert on the thing, you better be, one, in the room helping make the decision, and two, driving, helping to drive the decision. And I don't care how senior you are, right? And that was the cultural signal that was important, which was about mutual ownership, and also expertise not sitting in hierarchy.
(00:16:43):
And then the optionality thing is probably a little more obvious, which is don't make somebody the CMO, or even the head of marketing, if you're marketing team is two people, right? Yeah, you might make the right choice, but two years later, your marketing team's probably going to be more than two people, say it's 20. And are you going to have to layer somebody or have too many titles? And then someone feels like they're losing something, right? It goes back to the levels and ladder saying, but it's worse because you've given something, and then you're sort of taking it away, and that's just not... Organizationally, you want more flexibility. Honestly, I'll say my final thing, which is I have a little bit of a knit where you meet a company. I get what's happened, which is in order to hire this person, they had to sort of say, "I'll make you the VP of sales or the VP of this," but the company's like 25 people and there's seven VPs.
(00:17:40):
If you're a customer or you're evaluating it, you're kind of like, "Really?" It's a little incongruous with the scale. So we kind of more flexible. We had a lot of growth, head of this or growth lead. I know you're all about growth, Lenny. Well, we definitely took growth and find that very broadly. But the other thing I've said to people internally... Sorry, you can really get me going on this one. I bet you didn't think that. If you are a stripe and you're going out into the market, actually it speaks to the same thing, which is you're going and trying to sell to a customer who's a lot bigger than you. I'm not saying make up a title. Don't say you're the VP of sales, but you can be creative about how you represent your scope because you probably have really big scope because you're one of the only people helping to sell the product. And that will help you because a lot of more established mature companies are trying to do that hierarchy match, where "Well, bring your SVP because my SVP is coming to the meeting."
(00:18:42):
And we could be like, we don't really have that. It just gives you a little more selling flexibility too.
Lenny (00:18:48):
I like that. I like combo where you can just say something that fits in this situation, even though that's not your technical title.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:18:53):
Yes, you can say, "Oh yeah, I actually am in charge of optimization for our payments product." I'm sure you are. I'm sure that's what you
Lenny (00:19:01):
Do. Coming back to something you talked about with the career ladder, and I had a question around this, you talked about how oftentimes people do it too late, and I'm curious why it's so important to think about the stuff that you wrote about in this book so early in your company's life cycle. I think in the book you mentioned that it's oftentimes as important to get your operational structure and cultural structures in place incorrect as finding product market fit or finding your first few customers, which I think would surprised a lot of people. Can you talk about why you found that to be so important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:19:35):
Not only can I talk about it, I wrote a whole book about it, so let's try to restrain me. But here's what I would say. Obviously product market fit is the most important. And what I do say in the book is focus on that and don't get too far. My book is definitely not zero to one. It's more like maybe 0.5 to 1.5 or one to two. Because I do think when you're smaller and focused on product market fit and finding your user and getting that traction, that shapes a lot of how you work and your goals and who you hire, and that all makes sense. I think the thing that happens though is, one, some companies don't quite realize they're hitting it and they start to get behind on actually building the company part. Because guess what?
(00:20:23):
It turns out product market fit is just the product, and that is not a company, and that will not scale, to point. You see these companies that sort of fall over and there's sort of a bad article about them, and often it's not the product, it's the fact that they didn't actually build the company very well, and that started to harm, in fact harm the product and harm the mission. You have this vision, you're going to solve this problem with this product. And all of a sudden you can't solve it because you didn't scale the org properly. You didn't keep the cultural fabric strong as you grew, right? And so that's why I think it's so important. And so let's say you are hitting traction, and hopefully you do notice it. Because I think a lot of founders, you're kind of paranoid.
(00:21:08):
Like Stripe, I don't think Patrick and John fully embraced that they needed to start scaling maybe until I showed up, and that was part of hiring me. I was like, yeah, this is it. It's happening. It's not just look at the numbers. It's like look at the inbound support demand, look at the inbound sales leads. I just did the math, and I was like, this company should be probably twice the number of people it is right now, which of course freaked everybody out, but it was very obvious to me because I was coming in outside with that perspective. But more importantly, not just scaling things like sales and support... And as you probably know, if you work in payments, you've got a lot of other functions that are very important around risk and compliance and you name it, or the machine learning models and that help you do those things.
(00:21:55):
But for the sort of structures and operating processes that I talk about in the book, I do have this analogy which I think you picked up on to building a house, which is you have the supporting beam. Say it's a post and beam structure. You need the posts and the beams, and then you're going to have to do the mechanicals, right? There's going to have to be some amount of wiring in order for you. I don't know if you have your solar panels, but you got to bring in the heat, you got to bring in the cooling and plumbing, and then you have foundational stuff that you have to build or the whole structure will fall over. And I think of putting in the posts and beams and the mechanicals and the foundation as actually essential to scale. Because if you do those things well, you build them in such a way. This is almost like a Russian doll kind of thing, but you build them so that they're replicable, right?
(00:22:49):
So the way that you do goals as a company can start at the company level, and this is how OKRs were so beautiful for Google and they can replicate down to the individual. And the same common structure allows that to happen at really different levels of scale. And that's what you're looking for, is what are these common things? We do not a lot of them, by the way. You don't want to mandate a lot, you don't want to put too much structure in place, but enough that everyone can play with it up and down what I would think of as the stack of the company. And if you don't start putting those things in early, people will just invent those things. And then you'll have... Picture a house that got added on to 17 times and it's not even two years old. It looks not super stable. And then you're going to find yourself having to do a tear down, which I think we've all seen companies do that.
Lenny (00:23:40):
I definitely want to get into that house structure and all the components of it. But before we get there, if you're a early stage founder just looking for product market fit, maybe the skipping ahead a little bit, but which elements do you think are the most important that they need to do now? Because they're going to read your book, which gives them so much advice on all the things you can do.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:01):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:24:02):
If you have to pick a couple things that you have to nail when you're just starting out before product market fit, what do you think is most important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:08):
I think really that early, keeping it very simple and being focused on that goal of product market, which is like what is the problem you're trying to solve? What's your vision?Everything you have to do for an investor pitch deck matters not just for the investors. By the way, people forget this. A lot of the story you tell to investors, early ones especially is the story you should be telling internally to anybody you hire. Why do we exist? What problem are we trying to solve? What early customers have we attracted, and what's their feedback. That's what you mostly need, but you need to remember to share it and don't just use it for fundraising, or don't just use it for a board meeting or an investor meeting. Use it internally. And I think you can get pretty far actually with that core content. As you start to...
(00:24:56):
The first thing you're probably putting in place is a little bit of hiring process, and I think that's going to matter sooner than you think. Don't just be tempted to hire people in your friends. Think about what you need, what capabilities you need to build even pre PMF, right? And so as I said, there's a chapter about that, but I think some of the simplest versions of it is how do we evaluate talent? What kind of talent are we looking for? Where do we go look for talent, figure that out, and sort of train people a bit internally on interviewing. I think interviewing is not a skill that comes naturally. People think it does. It does not. And there's really basic easy tips and tricks you can find even on the interwebs about interviewing. And I really recommend... And my book has examples of rubrics, questions you can use. How do you really get at... Because it's hard to really evaluate someone in 30 minutes or 45 minutes.
(00:25:49):
So I think interviewing some of your fun fundamental early investor kind of content you need. But then when you start to get some traction, then you're showing to codify and actually document what I call more foundational content. Because if you're pre-product market fit, you're probably small enough that you just can tell everybody all the things. You don't have to send them the packet or have them sit in the onboarding. But the minute that you're starting to get any kind of hiring speed, you're going to want to document it more and you're going to want to start to put some very lightweight processes of how you get things done in place, because again, you're trying to replicate velocity. It's easy when you're all in one room and everyone knows like, "Oh, this is the most important thing to get done today," hack, hack and hacking away. But then pretty quickly, that is not going to be the case.
Lenny (00:26:38):
I definitely want to go one layer deeper on that, but there's this area I wanted to get to before we dive into some of the weeds around that, which is I found it really interesting that you started your book with this idea of personal operating principles versus here's how the company should work. It starts with here's how you should think about yourself. So I want to go... There's four of them... But before I get into them, can you just describe what is the idea of a personal operating principle and why is that important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:27:02):
Remember the book is about two things, company building and company structures, and all that, replicating all that good step and management. So the other thing that the book is really about is management tactical guides to... It would be easy to build companies if there weren't humans involved, right? But there's humans and they're complicated, and I'm complicated and you're complicated. And there are things that motivate us. There are things that demotivate us. They're not the same things, though Lenny and I, I think you and I have some things in common, but point is the book starts with you. And I think a lot of people think management starts with the team, or even the company. And actually, I think founders make this mistake. Founders think, well, it starts with my product. And yeah, but it actually starts with you. And so the book starts with sort of my belief system, which is self-awareness, which is the first operating principle. Self-awareness to build mutual awareness is actually the most fundamental thing you need to crack if you're going to succeed at company building or management, in my opinion.
(00:28:08):
But I would say I'm one of those people who has strong opinions that are pretty loosely held. This one is a strong opinion strongly held, which is the more that you can seek feedback, seek to understand your motivators, your strengths, your blind spots, your tendencies, and take that on board and expose it to others, you're going to be a much more effective company builder and manager. So it starts with you. And those operating principles that I articulate are sort of mine, but they're also foundational to the content of the whole book. I do think authentic leaders tend to have their own, right? Lenny, you probably have a few that you... You maybe have not articulated them all out loud, but I do have mine and they're in the book, but I think you would also find that some of them you could adopt. If you were looking for were some to start to use as a leader, I would hope that I've put forward a couple that might be useful.
Lenny (00:29:04):
I want to talk about these four, but while you're on that topic, what are ways to help crystallize your own operating principles? What advice would you give people to do this? Because to your point, people probably have them in their head, but they haven't really written them out.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:29:17):
That's right, they haven't. The book has an exercise that I recommend in it that's a little bit more about crystallizing your personal values, but that's kind of the place you want to start. And it's essentially there's a whole menu, and you can find these online, of say 70 or 80 different values. And by values, I mean family, ambition, impact competition. People value education. People value different things differently, by the way. And there's no judgment. You might value being a very competitive person and I might value collaboration above competitiveness, and that's fine. We probably would both be very effective in a team for different reasons, right? So basically if you take a list of values and you say, okay, if I had to pick 10 of these that matter to me, then if I had to pick five of them, and then you really force yourself if I had to only pick three of them...
(00:30:09):
And it's actually good to have this in a dialogue with someone that you work with or well, and you sort of had to explain, well, why? Why, when I'm really pushed, do I have to hold on to say education or learning as a value? Or why do I have to hold on to integrity as a value? And I tell a story in the book about a manager I worked with where transparency was a very important value to him. And the thing is you usually have a story behind that value, right? And in the book, I use the name Eli for him. Eli ends up sharing this story at this offsite that we had. And the transparency value actually was a little bit problematic to manage because Eli would tell everyone everything, including his team, even when we weren't finished with the plan, right? But Eli got up and told a story of being younger, like seven or eight, and realizing his mother was very sick, and no one really told him what was going on.
(00:31:07):
And then unfortunately watching the process of her dying and then being taken out to lunch by his stepfather and told, "Your mother is gone." And okay, well, your whole worldview kind of explodes when you hear that, and you're like, oh, okay, this transparency thing is really real. This was a formative experience for him and it has changed how he operates, and it will probably have changed it for his whole life. And if you can get to that point on your own, of telling yourself, what was the story? What was the thing that made this so important to me? Then you're starting to be in a mode of self-discovery and then you're starting to document, okay, if these are my three top values, and here's why. And then I think what you want to look for are my, what I would call my work style tendencies? And so you get your values, and then you sort of go on a... I'm sorry, I could go on about [inaudible 00:32:08]. I warned you. I wrote a book about this.
(00:32:09):
But basically, all these work style assessments, Myers-Briggs, DISC, Enneagram, you name it. And by the way, I would take all of them because I find that very good. I mean some of it's just data. You're just taking on data. But a lot of them come down to are you introverted or extroverted? Are you more introverted or extroverted? Where are you on that continuum? And are you more task, if you kind of picture a horizontal and a vertical, are you more task or people oriented? And so I would take your values, and then I would plot yourself. Am I a more extroverted task-oriented person, which means you're kind of a director, get what done kind of person? Or am I a more extroverted people-oriented person, which might mean actually you're probably great at being very charismatic and building some followership and maybe selling a vision? A lot of salespeople are very extroverted people oriented people.
(00:33:03):
And then you start to see, okay, if this is my sort of tendency in my default and this is my value system, what are the ways that I operate that really make up who I am and becomes almost a belief system. And my operating principles in the book, one is to build self-awareness, to build mutual awareness. Another one is say the thing you think you cannot say. I think that I've come to believe that often your biggest strength, one, is also your weakness, but two, is something that you don't know is a big strength because it's almost like breathing. For me, saying something actually fairly openly and directly but in a non-threatening way is a thing I do. John Collison actually once said to me, he's like, "It's so interesting when you give feedback, that can be actually pretty brutal, I leave feeling really optimistic."
(00:34:02):
But I don't mean to be brutal, but I think I can sort of unpack and say this thing, like here's my observation, here's going on, and it's not judgmental, it's not threatening, it's actually opening up an opportunity for people. So say the thing you think you cannot say. You would actually find that more of us can do that. And then I come back to distinguish between being a leader and a manager, which is something early in my career, I did not do well, Lenny.
Lenny (00:34:30):
Before we get to that one actually, just to briefly ask you a follow up question, because I love that you're getting through all four here. This is great. But I was going to ask, is there something.. So clearly, you're really good at saying the thing you cannot say, and I love that. Many people are not good at this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:30):
No.
Lenny (00:34:45):
Do you have any tactical advice for someone that is not good at this for how to actually say something uncomfortable?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:51):
I think the main thing is, and Fred Kaufman has this in his book, Conscious Business, this concept of a left hand... He calls it the left hand column, which is you're in a dialogue with me or you're watching a meeting happen, and you've got a running commentary in your head. And honestly, some of that stuff is pretty harsh, right? You do not want to open your mouth and just say that thing. But what Fred says is, learn how to detoxify the left-hand column. I would say think about a way to say that thing that you think you can't say. You've filtered yourself out, which I don't like. And I want you to think, okay, can I? And I think that the... Here are the tricks, a couple of them. One is, ask a question.Right? A question is not threatening. By the way, the question could even be, is there something we're not talking about? It feels like to me... And then you own.
(00:35:47):
So the next trick is you own it. This is your observation, this is your perception. This is not a judgment. I am not saying, "Lenny, I think you really botched that interview." That's not useful. If I said, "Lenny, you know what? I wonder if you missed an opportunity in that interview. Did you feel like you missed an area that..." And then you're kind of curious. You're like, "What do you mean?" And I'm like, "Well, I'm kind of looking at this with you, and I'm standing next to you and I'm observing it." Right? That's less threatening. So one, ask a question. Two, make an observation that you own. So if I said, "I feel like there's something we're not talking about, and I wonder..." Oh, I own it. "I wonder if it's the fact that these two teams both seem to have the exact same project."
(00:36:32):
I talk in the book about a meeting I was in where it was very clear that we had two teams in conflict, and no one was saying the thing that was really pretty bad. I was like, this is pretty bad. We have two teams that seem like they both own a piece of work and are in conflict with one another. But I would say if you do those two things, ask a question, own the observation yourself, don't pass a judgment, you will get way farther than you would've ever thought sharing. And by the way, that sharing, one, there's probably other people who just haven't, can't get it out of their head, and you have ar opened up a door that a lot of others can probably walk through. You're not alone.
Lenny (00:37:12):
You have this framework, I think you call it being explorer, not a lecturer. Is that what you just described? Is that how you describe it?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:37:18):
It is. And to me, what I just talked about was more of a meeting or a conversation scenario, but I think that this... I'm glad you brought that up. I think this is actually a very fundamental management framework of mine, which is in a one-to-one interaction, your job as the manager... First of all, too many people think your job as the manager is to be the expert and tell people what to do. No, actually, your job is to enable people to be their very damn best on your team. And you have to create an environment and a context and provide them information, and then you need to provide them a form of coaching. Now, again, I think people start think coaching is lecturing, like let me coach you how to make this Excel model. And sometimes they do. Sometimes someone comes to you and says, "Can you exactly show me how to do this thing?"
(00:38:05):
Fine. But most of management is actually exploring with someone. It is being curious. It is saying, "I have seen this pattern of your work. Have you seen this pattern? Is there something..." I have a whole other framework which is about hypothesis based coaching. I think intuition as a word gets kind of a bad rap, and I kind of get why, look, especially if you work with a lot of engineers, which I do. It's not particularly always data driven, but guess what a scientific hypothesis is? It's a well-informed piece of intuition. And I think too many managers wait until they have a million pieces of data to make an observation to someone about an area for improvement. Instead, I would say take some data, form a hypothesis, and then explore it with the person. Because if you're well intended, which I think any good manager is, I'm bringing up this thing because I'm trying to help you see it and tell me if it's true so that we can both help make it more effective, better.
(00:39:11):
One very light example could be, "I felt like in that meeting... How did you feel that presentation went?" And the person sort of says, "It's fine. I think I got through the material." You say, "Yeah, I felt like you were maybe a little bit nervous. I'm just exploring. Were you..." And by the way, the person could say, "Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no." And then you could back off, or you could say, "Oh, well, maybe it was just me, but I noticed some physical. Your leg was shaking a little bit, your voice, you were kind of repeating yourself." And they're going like, "What?" And you're all you're doing is holding up a mirror... And you have to own it. You have to say, "My experience of you in that meeting was that you seemed nervous to me. Maybe you were not, but actually maybe this is just a physical coaching thing."
(00:40:04):
Have you ever had that? I have a few people on my teams who do this weird thing. This is pre virtual world, but when they're sort of getting it uncomfortable in a meeting, they put back their chair up off the table, sort of exit the circle. And that is a very physically big statement. And they had no idea, Lenny. They had no idea. I'm just watching the meeting, and I'm like, oh my gosh, you're like four feet from the rest of the group because you do not like this topic. And what I need to explore with you is how do you vocalize that instead of physically exiting the room or exiting the circle? These are just examples. Sorry, I could keep going. But I really think that that attitude of exploration and mutual sort of collaborative, let's discover some things about you...
(00:40:54):
And by the way, it can be mutual. They can go right back at you and say, "Well, I observe this." Great. Great. I've interviewed a lot of people for the book, different leaders and managers from lots of different fields, but one of them was Reid Hoffman, who's a more typical. But Reid, we were talking about the other operating principle, which is management versus leadership. And Reid was pretty honest. He's like, "Look, I'm more of a leader. I'm not a manager." He's like, "I'm not a great manager." And then he told me the story. He's like, he had in his first company that he was building, he had a guy that he'd hired who was more operational. And Reid was sort of making an observation to him about something they should do, and the guy goes to him, "Reid, I wouldn't hire you to manage McDonald's."
(00:41:42):
And Reid was like, "Okay, good. So tell me what we need to do so we can fix this thing." But what actually Reid's operating principle, interestingly when unearthed that whole thing, was that he prides... It's very important to him to create an environment of open feedback. He said, what I love about that story, yeah, it's funny and embarrassing, but actually that guy was comfortable saying to me, "I wouldn't trust you to manage a McDonald." And I think that actually I found inspiring because I don't think everybody who founded a company or who's managing someone has created an environment with how much trust in it, right? And that's how Reid thinks he gets a lot of stuff done, is people just come right back at him with the feedback.

(00:43:19):
So we've done three of the operating principles that you personally use, which I love. I love that you're going to going through [inaudible 00:43:25]
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:24):
Distinguish management and leadership is the third one, yep.
Lenny (00:43:28):
And then just to summarize real quick, the second one was to say the thing that you cannot say. The first one was-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:34):
Say the thing you think you cannot say, yeah.
Lenny (00:43:36):
And then first, build self-awareness to build mutual awareness.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:39):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:43:41):
And what's cool is you're sharing all these amazing stories and tactics. In the book, you actually have templates to do each of these things for yourself. So a lot of this is pointers too. If you actually want to do this, go check out the book and you can actually do this. It's not just in a bunch of high level stuff. And then the fourth is-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:57):
Come back to the operating system.
Lenny (00:44:01):
Let's talk about it.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:44:02):
So this one is, sort of like I was talking about, touchstone documents that you might create for your company. This is our operating principles, our values. This is my touchstone, which is I think that especially high growth environments, but every environment you operate in can get really chaotic, and there's a lot of ambiguity. There's a lot of stuff you don't know, and it's kind of easy to get paralyzed or to sort of give into the chaos. And you're like, oh my gosh, I don't know what this day is going to bring. I'm just going to randomly assign some stuff, and I'm just going to get through it. And all you're doing in a lot of those moments is creating more chaos. And I think a really important role of definitely managers, but some leaders too is to create a stability when there doesn't feel like there's a lot that's stable.
(00:44:52):
And where stability comes from is in ritual and in common practices that you share. So we set quarterly goals or monthly goals. And that's a ritual, and that's a thing we do, and it's actually a source of stability. And yeah, it feels like a process. It might feel like a way of managing, but it also has a cadence to it. And I think one of the things that happened is you picture yourself sort of spinning out of control. You think, how do I come back to this is the order I do things, this is how I get decisions made, this is how we make plans, this is how we make decisions. Those touchstones are not processes to run the thing. If they're done well, they're stabilizing because they're a common way of approaching that everybody has, so they can at least hold onto that even when all the other stuff is going haywire.
(00:45:45):
You've got a customer churning, and you've got a big launch happening the next day, like, oh my God, oh my God. Come back. What's our launch? How do we launch products? We have a way of doing that. We do not need to spin out of control and reinvent the wheel here, right? And that's a stabilizing thing. And the other thing on come back to the operating system for me was, as my career scaled, as I went from a individual contributor, to managing a small team, to managing a bigger team, to managing multiple teams, to managing managers, you get it, I realized actually, and I started to have multiple functions. So I was context switching between... At Google, there was a point where I had some product people, industrial design operations, really BD, really different functions. Actually, how I fundamentally ran them at the bare bones, at the house architecture level was the same.
(00:46:38):
And that gave me a stability as a leader where I would dive into a meeting. I'd be like, all right, let's look at the metrics that matter. We all had... We had them for every team. Let's look at the goals we set. And that also helps you stabilize when your contact switching between seven different projects or seven different teams. And so I wouldn't say it's the operating principle that I talk about the most, but I think if you were like, "What's your sort of... How do you scale yourself?" I would say, "Well, I actually have a common operating system like a computer, and that is how I maintain a sense of stability."
Lenny (00:47:17):
Perfect segue to the next kind of broad area I want to spend time on, which is this house metaphor and the three components of it that you talked about. And this is like the core of the book. Can you talk about again, the three kind of pillars of this house structure? And then let's just go through each of these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:47:33):
Yeah, it's definitely, the beginning of the book is about company building, and the company structure chapter is all about the sort of supporting beams, the mechanicals, and then the foundational stuff. And interestingly, it's sort of, well, I guess when you build a house, you build the foundation first. So one is the founding documents that you might create, which I'm happy to talk about. And then another are the supporting structures, which are some of the ways you do things we talked, like quarterly business reviews or OKRs, or how you use planning to create a structure that everyone... And then the mechanicals are what I might call the operating cadence, which is essentially the rhythm of how you work, right? The calendar, the year that we all experience tends to dictate a little bit how we work. Mondays feel different than Sundays, right? Well, companies have that same kind of a cadence, which is often also calendar driven, but also can be event driven.
(00:48:28):
We've talked often at Stripe about how our customer event, which we have called Stripe Sessions, is as important internally as it is for the customers because it's a forcing function for our cadence, how we plan our products, what we want to have achieved by that point, what we want to demonstrate. And that's true for a lot of companies, but we actually use it in our thinking about our cadence of the year. And actually, we've built this other event that I usually help run, which is an internal event that happens generally about six months before that, which is great because you can demo the stuff you think you want to demo internally. You sort of create a cadence of we're going to push ourselves to do some crazy wild stuff, internally demonstrate it, and then see if we can externalize it by the time we hit the customer event.
(00:49:16):
But that is a cadence. Quarterly business reviews are part of your cadence, et cetera. So that's the fundamental, but really while I'm trying to do is say, one, I don't think this stuff is super hard. You know this. It's kind of hard work. It's just putting it in place, and then actually using it. I think where a lot of leadership teams go wrong, especially of young companies, is they experiment with different vehicles to try this stuff. And then they either don't actually follow them or they throw them out the window after they haven't tried it for very long, and it creates a lot of chaos. So I would say do very few things consistently and try to do them well, and then see if they're working for you, and then once a year, maybe think about a revision. But don't keep throwing out new things you heard that other companies do. And it turns into a weird grab bag of operating stuff. You're nodding because you've seen this too lot.
Lenny (00:50:16):
Yeah, I think a problem I've seen is people think there's going to be this perfect system and process that's going to not have any flaws, and they're always like, "Oh, it's not perfect. We got to optimize it further." And what I find is it's always just like, this is the best one you can come up with at the time. This is the best idea you have now. There's going to be flaws. Just work around those flaws. But just know there's never going to be the one thing that works.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:50:35):
There is no one. There's no perfect org structure, there's no perfect operating approach, there's no perfect, yeah, performance and management and level system. But having one and committing to it is good. And don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Lenny (00:50:50):
There's another, you mentioned that I thought it'd be fun to talk about, that it's often chaotic at a company. I imagine people think about Stripe from the outset, like, oh, they've got it all figured out, so smooth, just runs like a machine. And I think people look at other successful companies and they're like, man, things are so crazy at our company. This isn't normal. But I think, you tell me if I'm wrong, most places are crazy and chaotic internally for a long time and often, right?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:51:15):
Yeah. There are different kinds of chaos, but it's so true. What is that? There's like a saying. Don't ever believe your best press or your worst press. It's never as bad as whatever someone's saying it is never as good. It's just normal is not pretty. It's a lot. And that is true. It's happening everywhere. I used to have a friend who was building a company. We would see each other. We both were from the Boston area, and it's a long story, but we'd end up on the same flight off in Rhode Island, coming back to Boston occasionally for stuff, for family. And we'd be in getting yelled at by the passengers because we'd be in the aisle of the airplane comparing notes about stuff that was broken.
(00:52:02):
And we had this expression, it was like, oh, and then I picked up the rock, and under that rock were some really ugly, creepy crawlies. But that's just like the way it is, is it's never perfect. But I guess I would go back to what I just said about having some stabilizing ways of doing things because that can create, I don't know, I'm not trying for a perception that the thing runs a machine, but more of a, that is a well run thing, right? And how do you create that perception? Because you adhere to some ways of running things and that are consistent, and it feels better even to the outside, even if there's a lot of chaotic stuff going on.
Lenny (00:52:45):
Coming back to the founding documents, could you just talk about what are in this group of founding documents? And I think even more interestingly, what's a sign that you should invest more time in this area as a startup?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:52:55):
Yeah. Very classic stuff is in here, nothing that you haven't seen or examples of. So one is I think it's good to have a mission. When I joined Stripe, we did not. It came to be apparent that to increase the GDP of the internet was probably the mission, because people kept repeating that back to us, and Patrick had written it on some website copy early on. But it was interesting that candidates and customers kind of grabbed it. It was very Stripe because it's a little bit intellectual and pointy headed and aspirational, but also it is... The GDP does involve economic progress, which we're all about, right? We're building infrastructure for commerce and payments for not just the internet actually. But anyway, point is have a mission, or at least the beginning of what's your one line of what you're seeking to accomplish.
(00:53:47):
And then I'm a big fan of writing sort of what we Stripe called our long-term goals, which were just not our short distance, but our longer distance, like why did we exist? And so the mission is one line, so you need a little more meat behind that, right? And actually, I think if you looked at our long-term goals, which by the way I thought would be a three to five year goal, I would say they're still relevant today. But one of Stripe's long term goals is to advance the state of the art and developer tools, which would not be something that everybody, especially every customer of would initially call out. But when you think about it... Lenny, you just did it. You think about it for a minute, you're like, yeah, the API and the docs and a lot of stuff that we've open sourced, Stripe cares.
(00:54:38):
Our forever user is fundamentally a developer. It's the person who's integrating Stripe, right? By the way, simple integration, complex integration, anywhere in between, we really care about their experience, and we care that the tools are excellent, because how are you going to increase the GDP of the internet if you don't advance the state of the art of developer tools? Right? Anyway, point is articulating that, because until I said that to you and I could talk about it with you and say you came to work at Stripe, you might not understand why we invested in certain things or why it meant so much to us in terms of our user experience and the mission. So articulate those things. And some of them might be a little bit aspirational, but they should feel at least real enough that you can have that conversation about... You look at anyone who works in a company, what they choose to do all day with their time should be guided by things like, what are we trying to accomplish?
(00:55:35):
What are our long-term goals? So if they don't know them, how are they going to make the right choices? So that's one. And then another is a lot of companies write company values, or at Stripe, we wrote operating principles. I think you had [inaudible 00:55:50] on, and she talked about these, and we even sort of took a version of ours and put them out for candidates so that they could evaluate, do I want to join this company, because I kind of want to know what it's like to work there? And I think that's really valuable to do because not every company is right for every candidate, and the more you can mutually match the better. But having some operating principles matters. I think you can go farther than that, but that's where I would sort of start, is those three things.
Lenny (00:56:17):
Awesome, I like the simplicity of this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:21):
How you know is people are asking you. Especially new hires are asking you a lot of questions about what's important, or "Why do we do it this way?" You said it yourself at the beginning. Doesn't writing something down, crystallize it? Time to write it down and crystallize it for everybody who works there.
Lenny (00:56:40):
And just to summarize you as a mission, your operating principle/values. What was the third one?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:45):
Yep. Long-term goals.
Lenny (00:56:47):
Long-term goals.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:48):
And sort of more details on why you exist. What are you really trying to accomplish?
Lenny (00:56:52):
Interesting. And then are those numbers in your experience, or is that a story of what [inaudible 00:56:57]?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:00):
Those are a little bit more, I think headlines. And I think your shorter term goals have numbers against them, right? So if you looked at your long-term goal, which might be... Another one of Stripe's is about accelerating globalization, and if you thought about what would that require, that would require us to be in a lot of markets. That would require us to have users and customers in a lot of market, and also to eliminate friction across borders. So those things, which is a very high friction thing, unfortunately in payments, and moving money, which it shouldn't be if you want to advance globalization, accelerate it, right? And so that can then become numerical goals and short term goals.
Lenny (00:57:41):
Basically objectives, and then-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:43):
Yeah, it's sort of the longer term objective, and then the key results part is early is shorter term. But actually, if you're having trouble writing your company goals, actually zooming way out and being like, "If we're going to meet this mission, what do we have to accomplish in the long term?" You can then walk back from that and be like, "Oh yeah, every goal we ever have probably fits in these three to five buckets." Bam. And then you write your short term goals actually more easily because there's always going to be one about, say, international expansion. There's always going to be one about additional products because we're trying to do X, and you can't do it with one product, or whatever. You can imagine the example.
Lenny (00:58:22):
Awesome. And I know your book has a actual examples of a lot of this stuff.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:25):
It does. It does.
Lenny (00:58:26):
So again, pointer to that. Okay, so that's the founding documents. The next piece is operating system. Maybe we go there, just what fits into an operating system for a company? What are the components of that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:38):
I think a lot of the components we've sort of touched on, which is do you have some sort of goals? This is now goes back what we were just talking about. For Stripe, we have an annual set of numeric targets that we put together, we have a system of goals or OKRs, objectives and key results, but sort of like what is your structure for setting milestones that you want to achieve, whether they're numeric or more like a binary, we got this thing launched, we didn't? And then QBR, so quarterly business reviews. How do we review parts of the business? What is the cadence? Well, first, what is the form by which we do that? Which would be this... I share examples in the book of this might be the template you fill out if you're a team and your reporting on how it's going and versus your strategy and your goal.
(00:59:24):
And then there's also getting into metrics and dashboards. What are things that you look at internally to measure progress, the input metrics and the output metrics? And I give some examples of that. And then mostly, I think there are other... As I said, there could be less frequent forms you use, like a user event or a launch, a way of launching products, et cetera, but it's really simple. It's mostly goals and how do you review the business. Planning. I talk a lot about planning, which is. You said this earlier, and you and I think both agree, which is there's no perfect process to plan for the next year or the next two years, but you still need to fight your way through having something, especially after a certain stage. And every COO I meet with, we sort of ring our hands together.
(01:00:11):
We're like, oh, planning and everyone hates us, too burdensome, but you still got to keep trying. You got to do it. And so we talk about planning processes and what they might look like and how you set them up. And then that's how you'd use goals and QBR to measure against the plan, right? So those are some of the operating systems. And then the cadence is just how often do you do these things? Actually, one of our big lessons, I think companies that are moving quickly and that are younger tend to resist some of the calendar based cadences of more mature companies because they seem slow. You're like, really? You're going to just achieve that goal in three months? Or are you artificially restricting yourself to some lowest common denominator of time? And so I get that fear, and I would say your cadence doesn't have to be one quarter or one six month, or even 12 months.
(01:01:08):
Stripe, we did sort of six month processes for a while. So instead of a year, we did it in six months. Still, there were things that took, by the way, a year or longer, but I think that play around with the timeframe and don't feel restricted by what other companies do. But one of our lessons on the QBR was sometimes those quarterly, because that stands for quarterly, those quarterly business reviews were too infrequent, especially for new product areas. They we're still in development. They were still getting a lot of feedback, launching a lot. And so we just said, okay, they're not quarterly anymore. They're like every six week business reviews. Fine, change your cadence. The point is to have one, because then it's predictable for teams. They know what they're marching toward, they know when they're going to be reporting out, and they can set their goals in a way that makes sense to make progress in that timeframe.
Lenny (01:02:02):
One quick question there. What's a sign that your cadence is off? What's a flag that we should go shorter or longer?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:02:10):
Well, everyone usually complains about these things, but I think if the... One, nothing, like you said, it's probably too fast if not enough progress is being made in between whatever your review or your reporting function is, and it's probably too slow if the content you're reviewing seems stale. And you're like, "Well, we knew this," or "We already did that thing," or "Yeah, we already had the meeting where we talked about that." That's another thing that's interesting, is some companies will have a pretty frequent metrics review cadence, and then an infrequent strategy review cadence. And what happens is the metrics review becomes the strategy review because you're not talking about the strategy often enough. And so you're talking about it through the data, and so then by the time you get to the strategy review, you're like, we already had this meeting. And that's just a sign that some things are just off. And to me, it's about timeliness and freshness of the content, but also that there's actually new content. If there's not new content, you're creating work for people. By the way, give them time to work.
(01:03:12):
And so I think don't fool yourself that thinking, having more frequent checks on things is going to actually make things run faster. I would say that the opposite can be true. And so be very wary of actually slowing velocity down by creating overhead. One thing we try to do at Stripe is if we're looking at metrics, let's just look at your dashboard live. Let's not create a special presentation. I actually just share your screen please on your dashboard, right? Which is a good discipline, because one, that means you have to have a really good dashboard that's real time, that's web accessible. No one had to pull or massage the data. That's a good sign. But it's also, you're not wasting people's time prepping all that information, which happened even... By the way, at Stripe, even when we put that in place, we still ended up with versions of that problem.
Lenny (01:04:04):
Yeah, [inaudible 01:04:05] I think mentioned that. I think there's a term for it, data something, where you randomly get chosen every week and someone has to present your data.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:04):
The metrics review meeting, yes.
Lenny (01:04:10):
And it's like the next day, you're going to have to share your meetings and [inaudible 01:04:12]
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:12):
Yes. We called it the spin the wheel, the spin wheel on who gets to present. But that has a logic in it, which is then you're not working. So just prepare it.
Lenny (01:04:26):
Right. That's awesome. I love that policy. There's so much more I want to chat about. There's chapters on hiring, self-development, personal development, all these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:34):
Team development. Yep.
Lenny (01:04:36):
What was that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:36):
There's a, yeah, intentional. There's a team building.
Lenny (01:04:40):
Team building.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:40):
And performance management.
Lenny (01:04:41):
Yeah. Okay, so we could go through all that stuff. Instead, I want to talk about the COO role broadly.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:47):
Yes.
Lenny (01:04:48):
I asked on Twitter, preparing for this chat, what people wanted me to ask you about it. And most of the questions ended up being about the COO role and things like that. So I just have a few questions lined up here for you.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:48):
Sure.
Lenny (01:04:58):
Okay. So Amir [inaudible 01:05:04], with little accent at the end there, he asked just at what point do companies need a COO, and how would you judge if someone is a fantastic COO?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:05:12):
Oh yeah. Well, I would first say most companies, if you looked at the universe of all companies, do not have a COO. I think it's fewer than 20%. It's definitely fewer than 30. And I think that's something to know, that I don't think it's an automatic role to have or hire. And I think you see it in more prevalently in earlier stage or high growth companies. You also, by the way, see it in certain business models. I actually think Apple was an interesting version of this, where Steve Jobs was oriented in terms of product and design, but also that Apple has... It's very intense to manufacture software and hardware that then works together. I learned that when I worked on self-driving cars at Google, and you need a very intensely operational, detailed manufacturing, hit the marks, hit the timelines person. So I think some businesses that have a very deeply operational, say a manufacturing component, that role might be more prevalent.
(01:06:19):
But point is, it's not an automatic. I think it's useful in a high growth... In an environment where you're having... Think about the founder/CEO of a company that is achieving product market fit and also having to build a company, and hire all the leaders. That is a lot because you are building the product and the business, you are building the company, and you are building all the people, bringing them all in. And that is where I think a COO type of role can give you leverage, which is... Essentially, it's a layer that takes some of those functions and helps build them with you and on your behalf, and also in some cases, bring some experience in maybe there's a particular function like go to market that needs to be built. And I think that's where you see it come up. What I've said to some people recently is I'm a little worried, just like there's a mythical founder, that there's some mythical silver bullet COO hire that everyone's like, "I will just find that person."
(01:07:20):
And first of all, we're all human beings. I'm not perfect. I certainly did some things well when I joined Stripe, and other things not as well, and I'm working on my self-awareness of what those things are. But I would say one lower risk strategy could be to bring in, say, a head of business operations or a role that's sort of COO like and try a couple of functions with someone and see if they scale with the company and with the role, and then maybe you decide they're a COO. I mean, I mentioned Stripe's business operations team. You could hire a business ops leader and sort of say, "Hey, build this team to help be the Swiss Army knife to help scale the company, and then maybe that turns into more." Or there's some CFOs that are quite operational. They could take on more scope sometimes.
(01:08:11):
But I think there are other paths to getting that leverage, and there are also ways to de-risk the hire because you could end up searching forever, right? And I worry that it's become too much of a panacea in people's minds, like somehow they're going to find... And people will call me, and they'll be like, "I just need to find you." And I'm like, "One, I may not be right for your company, but two, that was a lot of work, and I think we actually, in the end, maybe got pretty lucky." How would you know someone is fantastic? Someone said something very smart to me, which was... I was in a meeting. It was me and Patrick. So Patrick is the co-founder and CEO of Stripe. And they said that having just the right amount of tension in our relationship was how you knew it was working for the company.
(01:09:03):
And it gave us both a little bit of pause, but we ended up having quite a good conversation after that meeting, which is there has to be mutual understanding and trust and an ability for Patrick to say, "Hey, can you go do this thing?" And then believing, I will do it at the level of quality and intensity and intentionality that he would like. But there also has to be some friction, where I would maybe say, "No, I'm not going to prioritize that. I don't think that's important for the company," or I'm going to give you feedback that I don't think we're doing this well, or he's giving me feedback. The customer experience is suffering. All your scale stuff is degrading this thing, right? So fantastic is not all hunky dory. Fantastic COO is just the right amount of friction intention with forward momentum and mutual trust, because then the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, right? That's what you're looking for.
Lenny (01:10:03):
I was actually going to say, I've worked with some founders, and they have this concept that they hire a COO, and they would just solve all these cultural issues they're having these relationship issues. And sounds like that's exactly what you're saying, is that that is not often the solution to some of these deeper issues.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:10:18):
Well, that would be the other problem, is actually believing... I was getting recruited, Lenny, and people would... Essentially, I felt like the founders were saying to me, "I'm going to give you all of the things I don't like doing as your job." And I was like, even if I'm by the way not qualify to do all those things, number one. And two is sometimes that list would be quite long, and that would make me nervous. I was like, "Do you really not running a company actually? Is that what's going on here?" And really, I think they weren't confronting elements of their work that needed to evolve and change. And what I loved about joining Stripe was... I think people also think, "I'm just going to hand all this stuff to this person and..." I'd love to say I took all this off of the Collisons plate, and Billy and John and the other people who were there at the time, and no, we actually were more collaboratively worked together, and I think it helped...
(01:11:18):
Well, one, you don't feel as isolated because you're in a team, but also there's more joint work than people realize, I think at least in the companies I'd like to work for.
Lenny (01:11:30):
For the final 10-ish minutes we have together, and you have to run-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:33):
Yes.
Lenny (01:11:34):
... I was thinking I could go through just a rapid fire set of tactical questions and see maybe one piece of advice you would share with someone that's maybe struggling with this thing.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:44):
Okay.
Lenny (01:11:45):
And the first is from a also Twitter person, Manuel [inaudible 01:11:52]. And he just had a question around, as you're scaling, keeping alignment strong is challenging. What would be something you'd recommend to someone that's scaling quickly and trying to keep people aligned?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:02):
Well, a lot of what we talked about, having common codified documents of what we believe in, how we work, and then using communication practices very intelligently. Never think that one communication, meaning an email or an all hands, reaches the audience. You have to be smart about how you communicate.
Lenny (01:12:23):
Awesome. Amazing. On a different podcast, we talked about how the leaders are often the repeater in chief, just having to repeat the same thing again and again.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:30):
Yes. And just like a marketer, use different channels. Some people read emails, some people watch videos, some people attend the meeting. Repeat.

# Bending the universe in your favor | Claire Vo (LaunchDarkly, Color, Optimizely, ChatPRD)

## Transcript

Claire Vo (00:00:00):
People often think that I get hired into later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company, and in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup.

Lenny (00:00:11):
Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:00:16):
I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster. If you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half.

Lenny (00:00:24):
There may be a trend happening here of combining engineering product.

Claire Vo (00:00:27):
I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design speed. What is best for the organization?

Lenny (00:00:38):
You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there.

Claire Vo (00:00:44):
Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably.

Lenny (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Claire Vo. Claire is a longtime chief product officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. She's also been a two-time founder, engineer, designer, and a marketer. She's also the creator of ChatPRD, which I suspect is the most used PM-specific AI product out there, which she builds on nights and weekends.

(00:01:19):
In our conversation, we dig into what PM skills AI will complement and potentially replace in the future, the story behind ChatPRD, and Claire's advice for how to stay ahead of the curve on AI within the PM role, the importance of feeling agency over your career, and how to bend the arc of the universe to achieve the things that you want to achieve, insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an exec, how she creates a fast pace within larger companies while also keeping the bar very high, the rise of the CPTO role, combining product and engineering under one leader plus a ton of career advice both for early career people and senior leaders, and so much more.

(00:02:01):

(00:04:16):
Claire, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Claire Vo (00:04:20):
Oh, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I'm even more excited. You're someone that, to me, has always felt inevitable would be on this podcast and that we'd be doing an episode together. Do you feel the same way, or not? And it's okay if you don't.

Claire Vo (00:04:32):
It's a privilege and a pleasure, and I'm glad I'm here. I've been so impressed with your guests and your content. It's been so exciting to see just the wide range of product leaders and thinkers in this space. And if I can be on a list of product leaders and thinkers in this space, then I'm doing something good. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:51):
It's absolutely my pleasure.

(00:04:53):
I want to start by talking about career advice. I was perusing your LinkedIn, and your career path is basically what most PMs probably dream of in their career. Just to summarize, you went from associate product manager to product manager to senior product manager to director to senior director to VP to SVP to chief product officer, and now you've been chief product officer of three different companies. And along the way, you're a founder, you're a designer, you're an engineer.

(00:05:22):
Here's my question. If you had to boil down what you think your secret sauce has been to progressing so far and so quickly throughout your PM career, what might that be?

Claire Vo (00:05:33):
Yeah, so when you list it all out, you can probably guess underneath it all is a relentlessly curious, impatient, eager to build person at their core. I just like building stuff and I find a lot of fun, and I think if you find a career or a craft that's fun, it's easy to accelerate your growth in that career. One thing, I just love what I do.

(00:05:56):
But when it comes to career growth and that progression from, I actually started as a copywriter of all things, copywriter all the way up to a CPO or CPTO that runs an engineering organization, it boils down to something really simple, which is know what you want out of your career, be clear and ask for it, and then make it easy for your boss or whoever can support or champion you to get you from here to there.

(00:06:20):
And so I'll take a really specific example from earlier in my career, where I had been in management for design and product management, so a senior manager level over product and design at an e-commerce company, and worked very closely with growth and marketing. We were just two sides of the same coin and worked very closely. And the head of marketing left and there was this big to-do pretty quickly of, "Well, what are we going to do with marketing? And do we need to hire somebody?"

(00:06:49):
And I sat for about a half a day and I thought, I think I can help here, drew out an org chart, put my name on the top, walked into my boss's office and said, "This is one potential solve of your marketing organization question, is we'll bring product and marketing growth together. I can be in this position. Here's how I'd change the management structure underneath this. Not just where do you put me, but where do you put everybody else? And I think this could work for the company, and this is how I'd suggest we roll it out and this would be my JD." And I got that job. I think when people ask me about career advice, they want to hear, "What can I do?" Really, what do you want? And how do you make it as easy as possible to make the case to your boss to get you here to there?

(00:07:33):
The other thing that I give people advice about is know what you want out of your current role and know exactly what you want your next role to be. And I even know this, and I even say this to my boss. When I was VP of product at Optimizely, I said to my boss, "I want to be a chief product officer. Here's how I'm going to get us here to there, and I want you to partner with me on it." And even coming into this role when I was interviewing at LaunchDarkly, my boss, Dan, the CEO of LaunchDarkly asked me, "What do you want out of this role?" And I said, "I want my next role to be a CEO role, so I want this role to fill in my gaps, learn, help me elevate my experience to get me to that next step."

(00:08:14):
And so I always know what that next role is going to be and I'm always clear about it. Now, I think there's a fine balance here. There's one thing to be very clear about your goals. It's another to suck the oxygen out of the air about only talking about getting promoted. These are probably 0.005% of my interactions with my boss are about my career growth and my path. It's very small. "Am I clear? Are we on the same page? And am I communicating as I'm making progress against those goals?"

(00:08:44):
High-slip people I think get promoted basically as fast as the org can support. I've almost never wished I promoted somebody earlier. I've seen managers or folks promote a little too early, and so as somebody that's managing their own career, you have to be a balance of ambitious and assertive and take care of yourself and advocate for yourself, and the work needs to speak for itself at the end of the day, and that's what's going to drive for your career growth. And so know what you want but do the work and produce the results, and you can have a career like mine.

Lenny (00:09:24):
Maybe first to summarize, some of the core advice you're sharing is know what you actually want because you're not going to progress towards this amazing future career if you don't actually know where you're going. Otherwise, you'll be pushed in directions that you're not necessarily interested in going.

(00:09:38):
I have a sense of where you want to go to tell people and ask for it. "Here's what I want to be doing in the future. Help me get there." And I love the other point you made of just, don't over-focus on that. There's many people that spend a lot of their energy on, "I need to get promoted. How do I get to the next level? I deserve the next level." And I guess maybe along those lines, is there any other advice you could share of just how to avoid being that person that's just constantly obsessed with promotion? Any more advice of just how to find that balance?

Claire Vo (00:10:06):
Yeah. One, you've got to lock to the norms, the talent norms of your organization. You should know how those things work, and they can work very casually if you're a very small startup and they can work more formally if you're at a very large company. And one, understanding how promotions operationally happen inside an organization can help you have those conversations at the right time in the right moment with the right context. That's one thing I advise. We're a slightly larger organization. We do promotion cycles. We have times during which we promote people. And so if you're talking to me four months before a promo cycle, maybe it's top of mind, maybe it's not. I sometimes functionally cannot promote people inside larger organizations whenever I want.

(00:10:52):
One is, I think, understanding the talent calendar of your team, especially at a larger organization. I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, "I want to be promoted because I want to be a director of PM, because I want to become a manager, because I need direct reports." Instead of saying, "Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here. I have a lot of credibility with this side of the product organization. I think we could be doing more if this position existed. And I think I'm good for this position because of what I've proven A, B and C."

(00:11:43):
That's solving a problem for the company. That's not solving a career growth issue for an individual. And I think people who want to be promoted need to think in that orientation versus the other, because honestly, especially now, let's say [inaudible 00:12:01]. There are not just these wrote every 12 months we're going to give comp increases and merit increases and you get to be promoted. We really have to be thoughtful about the structure and size and organization of teams. Product teams are naturally pretty small.

(00:12:19):
So, there aren't just management and director and senior director roles to go around. And if you want to get into a management, for example, you have to prove that you're good at organization design. I think really focus on why a role is good for a company or necessary for a company and then why you are the best for that role, rather than, "I want to get promoted."

Lenny (00:12:41):
That is such good advice and such important advice that focus on how do you solve problems for your manager and the business, not, "Hey, here's what I need for my career. This sucks. My career is stagnating." I love that. And I love so much of your message is empowerment. It's not just, here, there's the place you're in and there's not a lot you can do about it. Look for opportunities to help your manager, help your business. "Here's what I can do to move things further."

(00:13:06):
And I think there's an element of timing that you touched on. Propose this at a time when something could happen. You shared this example of there was a marketing gap.

Claire Vo (00:13:15):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:13:17):
Is there another example where you did this sort of thing where you presented, "Here's how I can help the org," and that helped another promotion? If not, that's good.

Claire Vo (00:13:25):
It's honestly how I expanded into leading engineering teams in the technology organization. I was at Color and there was a real need to up-level our engineering organization, and I knew exactly what to do. I had high confidence I had the skills, both technical and organizational, to scale the engineering organization in a way that was really critical to the business, both from a architecture perspective and from a team and talent perspective. And so that was one where I knew there was a problem to solve. I knew that problem was important. I knew we had to solve it fast, and I was confident I knew I could do it. I had confidence that I could help there.

(00:14:06):
And so I'm still doing it today. And at Color, I came in as product. I very quickly began leading the engineering organization, which was fabulous, and then I actually took on some of our non-clinical operations as well where we had a pretty operational leader. We had some high-scale challenges to deal with, and it fit my talent set and I knew I could help the company pretty quickly.

(00:14:32):
And this is the other advice I might give particular to PMs. PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role. That was actually my first director role. It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing and I had to develop skills there, but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career. And so I do think also looking left and right outside of your scope of product can be a really effective way to find growth opportunities.

Lenny (00:15:08):
I love that advice, and it leads to so many unexpected opportunities. One of the, I think, big questions with PMs, and coming back to your original advice of know where you want to go, there's so many directions a PM can go. You can eventually become a founder, become a GM, become a CO, something else. And trying these sorts of things often helps you understand, "Here's what I'm actually excited about. Maybe I want to move into design."

Claire Vo (00:15:31):
Yeah, and one of the other things that I think people don't understand, and maybe I experienced this as a founder and I really feel it inside companies, is the universe is bendable to your will. And what I mean is in most, at least in the stage I operate in in startups and growth stage companies and late stage startups, organizations are very fluid and I like to organize around talented motivated individuals.

(00:15:58):
And so just because we're organized in a particular way now, just because these organizations are separate or these are different, together, doesn't mean that's necessarily the way they have to be, and so you should think about your career growth in the existing structure of the organization. But as an org design thinker, it's a very important job that I have to do. You also have to think of this system as a living, breathing entity that can shift over time in particular around highly motivated, highly talented people.

Lenny (00:16:30):
And I think along the same lines, referencing this advice you've already shared of just thinking from the perspective of what is my manager and folks above, what are they struggling with and how can I propose, "Here's a solution that happens to also have me move into a more interesting role?"

Claire Vo (00:16:46):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:16:48):
There's a direction I wasn't planning to go into, but I think it's really important and interesting is people like you that are incredibly good and successful end up taking on a lot, and that often ends up not being what they want.

Claire Vo (00:16:58):
SOS.

Lenny (00:17:00):
Exactly. Any advice on the classic, be careful what you're good at advice? Any advice on just how to not end up with everything?

Claire Vo (00:17:08):
I really believe operating in your zone of genius. I really believe in leaning into strengths. And if you are in a position in which you're good at things and you've been giving a lot of responsibility, but you have tremendous growth edges and you're spending more time on the things you need to level up than the things you are exceptional at, I think that's not fair for the organization. I think that's not fair for you.

(00:17:32):
I truly believe defining and understanding your zone of genius, where you are exceptional, where no one else can step into the job and do just as good of a job as you can, and where you derive tremendous intellectual emotional joy out of the work is what makes it sustainable over time. And so I don't actually think it's about the volume or breadth of the work. It's about sustainability of the work. And can you show up every day energized and engaged and excited about what you do?

(00:18:04):
And I think being very aware if you are operating the space or if you're not. And this might go back to, I think, I have never regretted promoting somebody too slowly, I have regretted promoting somebody too quickly. High-slope individuals in particular areas want to get more responsibility, want to have more scope, and I've seen less experienced managers or directors or even people at my level want to give opportunities that put people in a position where they're neither effective nor happy. And so I think being self-aware of that is really important, and then I also think as a manager, being cognizant of that is really important.

(00:18:50):
Individually, I do do a lot, but I do feel like I'm in my zone of genius and I also know that part of staying in my personal zone of genius is having this breadth of responsibility but preserving builder time. And what I mean from time is I have to have time to produce real work that comes from me as an individual, and that means that calendar management is quite important. Time management.

Lenny (00:19:21):
We're going to talk about some of the things that you built.

(00:19:23):
In terms of finding your zone of genius, any advice for someone that's trying to figure out what it is that is in that zone of genius? I know there's a Ted Talk of here's how to think about the zone of genius specifically [inaudible 00:19:33].

Claire Vo (00:19:32):
Yeah. I'm not going to relay it in precision, but one of the tactics that I've seen out there is basically go through your calendar for the last month or quarter, whatever it is, write everything down, and basically group them into, I hated doing this, I didn't love doing it but it was fine, I love doing this, and then I love doing this, and if I could spend all my time on this, I would be the happiest person in the whole world. And literally categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, "How can I be here more?" And often, that is a true guide to where your passion is, where your special expertise is, and where you're going to add a lot of value because you're highly engaged.

(00:20:26):
I think the other thing is really asking yourself, and this maybe goes back to the career advice perspective, really asking yourself, "What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?" There are lots of things that I do that other people in the organization can do, but what are the things that I do that are... You think about a differentiated product that are hard to replicate, and knowing what that is and leaning into that can drive a lot of exceptional career growth but also just make you quite happy.

Lenny (00:20:58):
What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:21:00):
I think I'm actually quite good at traversing across and up and down. What I mean is I am fluent across product engineering, design, data and operations, and candidly revenue in a way that vertical or functional leaders maybe are less so. I feel like I have a high level of fluency broadly and can bring conversations between functions together against a business objective pretty easily. It's just the way I'm wired. I was a founder. It's second nature.

(00:21:31):
And the other thing that I think I can do pretty well that I find very joyous is traverse elevation. And so, yes, I love to be up here and think about strategy and vision, but I also like to drop into the details to move things forward. And I think that operating horizontally and then being able to spend some time in the vertical up and down, wherever that vertical up and down happens makes me quite happy. I think I'm pretty good at it.

Lenny (00:21:58):
Amazing. We're going to touch on some of these things you just mentioned actually, but real quick, you mentioned this idea of essentially an energy audit. There's actually a really good guide that I'll point to in the show notes by Matt Mochary that walks you through how to do this. And we talk about this a bunch on this podcast actually, this whole idea of just find things that give you energy, do more of that. Find things that zap you of energy, do less of that. Easier said than done when you have a job and you have to do stuff that people are paying you to do, but it's still really helpful if nothing else to help you point you where you want to be going in your career long-term.

(00:22:29):
Okay, so you mentioned you're a founder, and it feels like you're a founder at heart, but you've been working at larger companies for a while now. And I hear that you're really good at setting a fast pace within larger companies and maintaining that startup focus while also having a very high bar for quality and product. Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." Why would we not want that? I'm curious just what you actually put into practice concretely that allow for you to build teams that move really fast and maintain a high bar. Are there processes you find helpful, values, ways of working?

Claire Vo (00:23:06):
Yeah, it's really funny, people often think that I get hired into the roles that I get hired into in later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup. And so I think about it completely differently.

(00:23:23):
And there are two things I think about in terms of pace and high bar. From a pace, it's know what your internal pace is, and essentially don't let it degrade to the pace of your recurring meetings. I often find that pace of organization locks to pace of the calendar, and so I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, "Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting," it's, "No, we should discuss this now. We should decide this tomorrow."

(00:23:58):
The other thing that I think about is setting one click faster pace expectations inside an organization. I tend to come in and love this, hate it, it's what I do, which is if I look at an organization that is operating at a lower pace than I would expect, I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster, which means if you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half. If you think it needs to be done this half, it needs to be done this quarter. This quarter, this month. This week, today. End of day, in this meeting. And actually setting an expectation that your natural pace is going to be slower than your ambition and being explicit about pulling things in I think can change the way expectations are set and honestly change the energy and momentum in the organization.

(00:24:51):
The third thing on pace is personal SLA. I never want to be a bottleneck for the organization. This is one of the more challenging things about being in my role, is you are often a point of decision-making, tie-breaking, next steps, approvals, socialization. And if my personal SLA is slow, then the rest of my organization cannot be as fast as possible. I try to be fairly responsive. I try to say, "Do both very high rate," and also very quickly. It's really hard, sometimes it's not totally possible, but it's a goal I have.

Lenny (00:25:27):
I love this clock speed concept of just let's move one iteration faster than we would normally move. How do you actually do that? Is this just you doing it and then everyone trickles down from the way you're approaching it? Is this a principle on a team? Is there a phrase you use?

Claire Vo (00:25:41):
Yeah, it's a phrase I use and something I asked our leadership teams to do. It started at, one, I'm going to do this, and two, my expectation is you look for opportunities to do this. And the reason I think this is effective, it's very tangible and it's very tactical. It just is one of those things that a moment when you're about to say a due date, you check yourself and you go, "Is this right or do I need to pull it in by an iteration?" And so it's a very tactical piece of advice and expectation I give to my leadership team. If they can show up that way, then the expected pace of the organization goes up, and then people tend to rise to the occasion.

Lenny (00:26:26):
And then it connects very directly to your first piece of advice, is not rely on the meeting cadence to determine your action cadence. I imagine that's a similar situation where you tell people, "Here's how I want to operate," and then you actually work that way and that starts to filter through.

Claire Vo (00:26:41):
Yeah, I just think there's this anti-pattern of, "We'll make the decision in the next meeting," or, "We'll follow up on this in the next meeting." That is an artificial timeline introduced by Google Calendar or whatever calendar you use. It's not a real thing, and so I want to put us on real timelines. When can we make the decision? How much information do we need? And that doesn't mean that every decision is made now, today, tomorrow, but it does mean we don't snap to artificial cadences to make our product move forward.

Lenny (00:27:12):
Awesome. Let's talk about quality. What are some lessons there?

Claire Vo (00:27:17):
Yeah, I think in terms of high bar, there's probably two things that I think about as a leader. There's the talent bar being exceptionally high, and then there's the product bar being high.

(00:27:28):
I'll start with talent, which is, on the talent side I think you have to define the bar. You have to be really specific, and that means you have to think about pretty deeply what are your leadership principles? If your leadership principle is bring the clock speed up one iteration, be explicit that that's what you expect to see, and then articulate that and hold people accountable to it.

(00:27:51):
And so I do think it's really important to have a specific and measurable career ladder, especially at the senior levels. I often find that they're very soft. They're hires and manages multiple departments or takes in cross-functional stakeholder feedback. Those are just not tractable, specific things. And so I think, PMs, put on your product definition or OKR hat or whatever and define some real goals for these levels and be specific in a way that you can look at people and say, definitively, "Yes. Measurably, yes, they're meaning this bar measurably. No, they're not meeting that bar." And so I think that's very important.

(00:28:39):
The second thing I think is you have to normalize feedback. And Brené Brown, fellow Texan, love her, "Clear is kind," I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar. They just do, because the expectations are not stated and you're not holding accountability. And I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers. That is not helping them become the best teammate that they can become.

(00:29:08):
I really like to normalize feedback and, as I say, take the temperature out of the room when it comes to open and candid feedback. And that means being very clear when people are not meeting expectations, making it very clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent. And I think that has something that people need to hear to normalize feedback. But I think feedback is quite important.

(00:29:30):
And I think the third thing is unfortunately when you're working to build a high talent bar and high talent density, then when folks aren't a fit and it's not working, moving against that quickly is part of the job. And it's a hard part of the job and it's part of the job that most managers really avoid, but I think it's important because it keeps your overall team operating in a really healthy, effective, performant way that makes everybody happier, including people that probably weren't a great fit for the work of the role at the time.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Is there an example of you being surprisingly candid to someone or giving feedback, hard feedback, to someone about quality, something that's just like, "Oh wow, that's what I should be doing?"

Claire Vo (00:30:16):
There were two leaders in my organization, I won't say which ones and I won't say when, but two leaders in the organization, partners across product and engineering, and they could not get it together. They could not work together. They were having misalignments and priorities strategy. They could not communicate. They were having conflict in front of the team.

(00:30:38):
And the managers that had managed them were taking this very soft pedal approach of, "You need to work on your [inaudible 00:30:47] functional stakeholder, and here am I expecting all this performance management stuff to happen." And I called both of them individually and I said, "The way you are operating is not meeting our leadership expectations. If you do not change, you cannot be part of this organization anymore. I believe you can operate differently. I do." And I did. I believe these are very talented people who could operate. "I believe you can operate differently, but it is your responsibility to do so, and I need to see change starting tomorrow."

(00:31:20):
I wanted them to succeed. And in fact, they did. It snapped in, they got it, and one of the... Turned into one of the most influential effective managers in our team over the course of probably the next six to nine months. And I think just clearly saying, "You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path. I believe you can get here, but it is your responsibility." That is the conversation that is clear and kind and honestly very effective in most instances.

Lenny (00:31:55):
That's an amazing example. Clear is kind, as you said. It reminds me of Kim Scott, who's on the podcast, shared this story about Bob. I don't know if you remember that story at all of just this guy at their company who was just doing a bad job and everyone knew he was doing a bad job, and then they had to fire him. When they're firing him, he's just like, "Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone tell me that nobody thought I was doing a great job?"

Claire Vo (00:32:16):
And I honestly think saying, "You are not doing a good job," is much kinder than, "I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect." Or, "I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at..." That's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else.

Lenny (00:32:36):
Okay, let's go in a different direction. Let's talk about being a woman in tech.

Claire Vo (00:32:40):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:32:41):
This doesn't get talked about a ton on podcasts like this. I know you have a lot of thoughts. Obviously, you've been through a lot. You've had a lot of experiences. There's probably a lot of stories you haven't shared in other places, so I just want to give you a chance to share what you've been through, what you've seen, and any advice you may have.

Claire Vo (00:32:58):
Yeah, and I'm happy to talk about this. I know a lot of people don't want to be defined or consistently asked about being a woman or a mom in a C-level leadership role. Let's not have women in tech panels anymore. But I've been reflecting a bit on this lately because I just came from a few years in healthcare, which, from my experience, it's a lot more women in leadership roles. I was a little spoiled, even in our technology organization. And now, I'm back in startups and tech, where the ratios are completely opposite, especially in roles like engineering, which is a team that I run.

(00:33:30):
And look, this is just, it's math. I think Carta said that 13-something percent of founders last year were women. It's declining year over year. FEMA led founded teams, or at least 2% of venture capital, women hold 30% of senior leadership org roles. Women are 30% of software engineering teams. This is just math. We're just facts. We're not in the room in the equal proportions. And as somebody who has, despite the numbers, had a fairly successful career so far in technology, I feel like I owe it to the industry to say it hasn't been easy and it's still not easy, even at my level.

(00:34:09):
And what I want to be clear about, because it gets talked about a lot in forms like this, this is not about imposter syndrome. How could I have any right to imposter syndrome? I've proven myself. I've been a founder, I've raised venture capital, I've had a successful exit. I've been, as you said, a CPO across increasing large teams. I get to invest in red companies. I'm on boards. I get to be on this podcast. I'm a TikTok influencer. This is not about feeling like an imposter. It's really about, it is hard and it is different, and the numbers pencil out in a way that is not favorable to women.

(00:34:47):
And as you said, there's been a lot of stuff in the past that you look at me now and you say, "Oh, she did associate and all the way up," but I had to fight for my all-girls school to carry computer science at the same rate that the all-boys school had it naturally. I grew up in teeny tiny startups in the early aughts. I saw some nonsense. I had VCs tell me, "Don't get pregnant," when I was... These things happened. And yet here I am, and it's fine.

(00:35:21):
And I'm not complaining. I just think what people also don't understand is that stuff still happens. I don't need to litigate who it happens with, where it happens. It still happens. I have arrived and it still happens. And the reason I bring this up is I think it should be a point of reflection for industry, and I think it can be a really effective point of reflection for women who want to get into leadership roles.

(00:35:46):
And the way I approach it is I'm just very curious. I wonder what is structural about technology that creates these things happen? What is cultural? What is external? What has happened to me or happens around me? What is internal? What do I bring into the room that doesn't serve me? And so I try to stay very curious. And then constant product thinker, what are the points of leverage I can use to move things not just forward for me, but for the industry broadly? How can I influence thinking? Where can I not? Where can I walk away from things?

(00:36:24):
And then as for the internal aspect of it, I think this is also a very powerful thing, which is I try to stay in an empowered space. I know my value. I have no time for imposter syndrome. It's not a constructive thing for me, but I do think knowing that, as I said earlier, the universe is bendable to your will. There are things we can change. I don't think these numbers are not tractable. And so my recommendation and what I'd love to say to the industry generally, to women in particular, is curiosity and empowerment have been my path to joy in this sometimes complicated industry. And I think there's a lot better we can do. There's a little bit of ways to go.

Lenny (00:37:10):
Is there a story that you could share if you're comfortable of just something you've gone through or been through that maybe people are like, "Oh, wow, I see what stuff she's dealing with or other women are dealing with that I had no sense of?"

Claire Vo (00:37:21):
I've been trying to wrap my head around this one, which is I consistently get asked if I'm technical enough. Not even if I'm technical enough. Let's put enough aside. If I'm technical. And it's fascinating to me because as a technical co-founder of my startup, I wrote code for the first 12 months solo. I led the engineering team there. That code is still in production in very large environments. I have run multi-hundred people, engineering teams for many years, and I spend my Saturdays and Sundays shipping code. This is what I do. And truly, the first question most people ask me is, "Oh, well you're not technical though. You're a product person."

(00:38:11):
And I've been really trying to unpack where that is coming from. It's hard for me to imagine somebody else that looks different, that has a different name, that has a different gender getting that question with my background. And so that's one of those things that has really been spinning my head. Again, it's not about imposter syndrome. I don't have anything to prove to people, but I am quite curious where that orientation comes from. And if it comes to somebody like me, who has really had some proven success, I know it's happening to other people, and I'm hoping that I can do something from my position to turn that a little bit.

Lenny (00:38:50):
And this connects to what you shared, the advice you had of just try to get curious about why it's happening, which is exactly what you just said. Is that just mostly to help you not get upset and frustrated? Let me just understand, why is this happening again and again?

Claire Vo (00:39:02):
One, I do think sitting in your power is very effective. And so curiosity means that I'm in control, and I do think I'm in control more than I'm not. That's one part of it is, I think. And the other thing is I think a lot of this is it's complicated. It's structural, it's cultural. It's what you see and what you don't see, not just in the workplace. It's what you see and don't see in media. Am I reading my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old books of, "My grandma's a software engineer?"

(00:39:35):
Books called the Mom Test, which I actually think is a great book, but it has this underlying presumption of who is technical, who's not, who understands things, who doesn't. And that all bubbles up into how individuals experience an industry that's driving tremendous economic growth here, where at the end of the day, it's about economic participation. It can be about individuals and aspirations, but it is also about economic participation.

(00:40:00):
The reason I'm curious about it is I do think it's complicated and I do think you can be successful, but I don't think we're being successful at the rates I would love to see. And I think we're missing a lot of innovation and a lot of economic growth by not having incredible, technical, capable women start companies and lead organizations. And so I think we're all missing out for that, and I'd love to see more of it.

# Succeeding as an introvert, building zero-to-one, and PM’ing your career like a product | Deb Liu

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of.

Deb Liu (00:00:11):
Some of the best PMs I have ever worked with are terrible PMs for their career. They just drift from job to job. "Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what does success look like? How are you going to get there?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
You wrote this awesome post about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert.

Deb Liu (00:00:28):
The workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. It looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because it's self-promotion. But instead, what if I called it educating about all the great work your team has been doing? Helping people see why your team should get more resources, you have to actually share what you do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Is there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe?

Deb Liu (00:00:49):
The most important career decision you make is who you marry. Is this person lifting you up or pushing you back? You will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Deb Liu. Deb was VP of product at Facebook where she spent over 11 years and while they're created and led Facebook marketplace, which is now used by over 1 billion people monthly, she also led the development of Facebook's first mobile ad product for apps and its mobile ad network. Also built the company's games business and payments platform, including Facebook Pay.

(00:01:23):
Prior to Facebook, she was director at both PayPal and eBay. She's on the board of Intuit and for the past three and a half years, she's been the CEO of Ancestry. I actually generally have a rule of no CEOs on this podcast, but to me, Deb is a great exception because she's a product person at heart. In our conversation, Deb shares a ton of tactical career advice, including why resilience is so key to career success, how to PM your career like you PM your product, how to be successful in business as an introvert, what she's learned about building multiple billion dollars zero to one businesses within a large company like Facebook and so much more.

(00:01:59):
Deb is so full of wisdom and I'm really excited to share her insights with more people. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Deb Liu.

(00:02:18):
Deb, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Deb Liu (00:02:21):
It's wonderful to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:23):
It's wonderful to have you here. You have had such an incredible career. You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of and honestly just like one of those roles is a dream for a lot of people. And so I wanted to start with just this question and I want to see where the conversation takes us. If you could give one specific piece of advice to someone that's looking to do well in their career or to do better in their career based on what has worked well for you, what would that be?

Deb Liu (00:03:02):
Always be learning, and I tell this to everybody, so I often tell people, someone who's always learning is always going to exceed someone who's the expert today. You're going to find people... The one thing about school is that we go to school and there's such a thing as getting a hundred on the test, a perfect score on the SAT, graduating with a 4.0. Well, there's nothing like that in careers, right? We think it's actually a non-linear experience and there's always something better than you at speaking or presenting or strategy or execution. But if you're always learning, learning from the best, getting feedback, you're always going to get better every single day.

(00:03:35):
And that's what I have always held, which is each job I took, I didn't necessarily qualify for it. I wasn't necessarily the very best at it, and so it became the student of being better at that job. And once I mastered that, I was a student for something else, something else and something else. And so I always balanced learning and impact, which was you can have the most impact, the job you know the best, but then you stop learning. And if you're learning all the time, you're not necessarily having impact.

(00:04:00):
So how do you keep going back and forth and back and forth so that you're not going straight up a lot or you're actually laddering back and forth into different things where you're having an amazing time where you know everything and then you're the newbie again and learning new things, and you're incorporating what you used to know into what you're learning and the impact that you have today and so on and so forth.

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.

(00:06:31):
This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop in replacement for auth zero and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:07:03):
You talked about you got into a new job maybe you weren't ready for and you had to learn on the job. So either maybe share story one of those experiences or just like how do you actually do this? So someone's listening, they're like, how do I learn? What am I learning?

Deb Liu (00:07:14):
We'll start with my career in tech. So I had worked in consulting before business school. I went to Stanford for business school, came out to California, didn't know that much about tech, but I really loved using eBay. So I interned there my first year in business school and then when it came to finding a job, I really wasn't sure what we wanted to do, but we wanted to move back to the East Coast. And so I wasn't looking and I couldn't find a job. I think it was really hard. It was 2002. And so I ran into Tim Wenzel and Catherine Wu. So Catherine Wu was from Airbnb as you might know her. And Tim Wenzel put together the PayPal Mafia. He was the recruiter for PayPal.

(00:07:51):
Went to this table and I said, "Absolutely love PayPal, use it all the time. I'm a big seller on eBay," and he's like, "Do you want a job?" I'm like, "No, I'm actually going back east. "And he's like, "Just come in and talk to us." And so I said, "Okay. Well, what kind of jobs do you have?" And he's like, "I have jobs in product and I have jobs in marketing." Now, I've taken marketing class obviously in business school, and I said, "I wonder what this other product job is."

(00:08:12):
So I look over at Catherine and I've seen her around Stanford before, so she was a year ahead of me and I said, "Well, what do you do?" She said, "Product." I'm like, "That sounds good. I'll do that." And that's actually how I fell into product management. Well, I actually, and I'm embarrassed to say faked my way through those interviews, because during the interviews they're like, "Well, what would you build?" And since I was an avid user of both products, I could really richly say, "Here's the product feedback I have. Here are the new products you should build. Here's my feedback on things that we should be doing differently."

(00:08:39):
And they said, "Congratulations." And they gave me the job. And embarrassingly I went to the first day of work and I said to Amy Clement, who was the VP of product at the time, and I said, "Okay, I literally have no idea what this product job is."

(00:08:54):
She showed me the ropes and she was so incredible. She actually showed me, she said, "All those ideas you had, all that energy you've had around building these things, we go do that. Let's go do it." And I said, "Well, how do you do that?" And she said, "Well, you write down what you want to build and you work with the engineers to do it." And I just remember thinking, "This is crazy. I have no idea what I'm doing."

(00:09:14):
It was such an incredible adventure though. Those first few years, I just learned so much about the craft of building, how to really think through product use cases, how to think through what customers wanted, not just the customer of one, myself, but really what true customers and customer cohorts wanted. And so it was really a time when I felt like I was really blossoming, but I didn't come in with mastery. I came with a curiosity and I think that's what made me a great product manager was that I didn't have a set way of doing things. There wasn't some playbook I was trying to play. There wasn't some framework, but instead I was willing to learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
So one takeaway might be from this, the phrase, fake it till you make it. Any thoughts on just how to... I imagine many people right now are like, "Oh, I'm trying to get a job as a pm. How do I do this? That sounds great. I'm going to pass this interview, figure out the job after I joined."

Deb Liu (00:10:02):
Coming in with humbleness was really important, but during the interview process, actually, I didn't realize this, but they asked me questions as if I was a product manager, as if I knew what I was doing. I think when you have passion around a product or passion around a company or around a business model or around something, it shows. And so it's not necessarily faking the enthusiasm or faking the idea that you want to work there, but you don't have to know how to write this spec or PRD or briefings or anything like that. You don't know how to do customer research or do data analytics or read reports, but instead show your passion around the product itself, around the use case, around the customer.

(00:10:41):
Show who you are and why you care. I think sometimes people just say, "I want a product job." But you have to be able to fall in love with the problem. You have to fall in love, not with the product, but I said the problem, right? The use case. What problem are you trying to solve? And if you can do that, you can be a great product manager even without a lot of experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):
That's an awesome piece of advice. So just lean into the passion. First of all, part of it is you have to be excited about the thing you're trying to work on or thinking about the company you're thinking about joining. Sounds like that's a prerequisite here. We have a podcast episode with Uri Levine who has a whole book called Fall in Love with the Problem, which is all about that same idea actually for startup founders.

Deb Liu (00:11:20):
I'll have to read it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:20):
Yeah, he always wears a shirt, fall in love with the problem, not the solution.

Deb Liu (00:11:23):
Yes, is absolutely the most important skill for a product leader.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:27):
Something else I've heard you talk about in terms of something that contributed to your success is being okay with failure and just bouncing back quickly versus avoiding failure. Is that something that you can come back to a lot?

Deb Liu (00:11:40):
Well, here's what I noticed about everybody. I've coached a ton of people in my life. I have managed big teens and the people who are most successful are not the people who had no failures, who were lived charm lives, head up into the right careers and got promoted every cycle. The people who were most successful were the ones who actually through adversity, learned to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones. They were the ones who got hard feedback and then came back stronger because now they learned what to do differently.

(00:12:09):
They were the ones who products failed, but they said, "You know what? I'm going to turn this failure into success. I'm going to take those lessons and make this company stronger." When you live a charmed product life, you always work on everything that's easy. You don't actually... Trees are strong because they bend in the wind, because they're tested, because it's cold, because it's windy, because there's conditions.

(00:12:31):
And that's how a tree goes grow strong and tall over many generations. And I think sometimes we think, "Oh yeah, I wish I lived a charm life." And that is not what we want. You want to have enough adversity that you learn to overcome so that you can build stronger over time and build resilience in your career.

(00:12:50):
I've seen that so much, which is the best product leaders I ever worked with are the ones that have the toughest stories, that had the hardest feedback, but also the ones who were able to bounce back quickly and make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):
We have a segment on this podcast called Failure Corner where people share a failure they went through kind of along the same lines and something we learned from that experience. Is there an example of that from your career where a failure made you stronger?

Deb Liu (00:13:13):
Yeah. I remember there was a job that I really wanted at Facebook and I'd been there for a long time. I had been leading different teams. I was a VP of product and then GM. There was one job that I never got to do, so I got to do all the jobs I wanted and Mark gave it to someone else. I told him at the time when he gave it to the first person who was amazing at it, I said, "If this job were open, I'd like to be considered for it."

(00:13:37):
The job opened up later, gave it to someone else. And I said to Mark, again, "I really wanted that job." And he said, "Not only will I not give you that job, you'll never have that job at this company."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):
What?

Deb Liu (00:13:51):
He didn't say it harshly. But he was giving me feedback about something which he did not see me in that role, in a role that I really wanted. And I had to decide each time like, "What do I do with this information?" This is my dream job. Actually, I decided I was going to turn the job I had and the job I wanted, and that's a choice. I could have said, you know what? I can't have that job. I could go do something else, but I didn't. I took the job I had with the team I had and I turned it into this thing that was going to be something we wanted.

(00:14:20):
And so I think sometimes it's not... I think that that experience was a very humbling experience because to be told no and then to say that this will never happen was really hard. But at the same time it was a reminder that you're not right for every job even if you think you are. And that you can take the raw materials of what you have and turn it into what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):
Are you able to share what those jobs were that you wanted to get that you never got?

Deb Liu (00:14:44):
I never actually shared it publicly, but it's something which I had always had a role where I did new things for the company and there was a role where it was running something which more of an existing business, but I had always been kind of the innovator, the new stuff person. I had taken over so many new things. And so maybe that wasn't the right thing at the right time for me, but it was something that was really incredible and a turning point for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Great segue to an area I wanted to spend some time on which is building zero to one stuff within a larger company. So from what I can tell you built 2 billion businesses within a large company, Facebook marketplace, and then the ads platform within Facebook and maybe more. I don't know, the payments stuff, the games. I don't know. Maybe there's billions of dollars there I don't even know about. And this is very rare and very hard, and it's something we talk a little bit on this podcast, just the skills to build something new.

(00:15:38):
I know with marketplace it was not something people believed in for a long time. It took a lot of work to convince people to actually give it a shot. So I guess the question here is just what have you found are key tactics to start something new and allow it to continue to exist and get to a place where people start to believe it? What has worked for you?

Deb Liu (00:15:57):
So first, I didn't build the ads platform. I actually built the first direct response ad product company ever had. But we'll talk about how that led to why direct response is a vast majority of the ads revenue for the company. But one thing that it was really interesting is that I really saw my opportunity in Facebook to be somebody that zigged when other people zagged. There were amazing people who did a lot of the really core products working on feed, photos, videos.

(00:16:25):
I came in actually on the payments team and we worked on payments and eventually built games, which was the first billion dollar business. It was very successful. We worked with the likes of all the game companies that were on the Canvas games platform. And it was just an incredible opportunity to start from scratch and built something really cool. We built Facebook credits, which eventually became the Facebook payment system.

(00:16:47):
And then from there on I built the first direct response ads product. And again, leveraging the skills that we had, we had a lot of relationships with game companies because of my time and payments. And so we just said, "Hey look, what ad product do you want?" And they said, "Actually, your biggest challenge is the shift to mobile. Build us a mobile acquisition engine." And we said, "That's doable."

(00:17:09):
At the time the company was very brand oriented. Most of the ads... Actually almost all the ads on the platform were brand and we were not even on the ads team. So we actually worked on this team called the platform team. We said, "Okay, we'll build an ads product for the Facebook feed, the new mobile Facebook feed." And suddenly it became a billion dollar business within about 18 months, which was such an incredible journey.

(00:17:30):
We worked on the mobile advertising platform, so basically the mobile ads network. That was a great experience. And so each time I worked on something, it was just... The thing that you have to remember is the failure rate for something like this is very high. You start something and the amount of iteration... People think, "Oh yeah, it's easy." You start something and it's linear because you have all the resources of this company behind you. But actually everything in the company is like, "Let's do the most important thing."

(00:17:58):
These are seeds and we'll just let them... And so if you do that, you have to know that you don't get a lot of resources, you get a lot of attention. And I appreciated that because I think I work best when people aren't... There is not a lot of scrutiny. I think sometimes large companies, they say, "Well this innovation team," and then they check in on them way too much. They're like, "Week to week progress, where are you going? What's your strategy?" But so much as you know of building something new is the iteration process. It's the failing a lot.

(00:18:27):
We actually tested five or six versions of the ads product before we got it to take off and it took months, and then we were on the verge of death multiple times. In fact, I actually went back to run the payments team while I was working on that product because the team we had gathered still want to continue working on it, but I needed a second job back on the payments team because they asked me, "We don't think this thing is going to work. You should go run your old team again." And I thought, "Well, I will do both."

(00:18:52):
And so I did both for a while until it really took off. The thing that I think a lot of large companies don't realize is that you can love something to death. And so with every new product, I'd rather do it out of the limelight, do it with the minimal resources and have the freedom to fail because success and failure really is... In startups, failing fast is really important or succeeding fast.

(00:19:18):
It's the long slog that makes it really hard. In a company, you end up getting cut if you're the long slog product. And so being able to just say, "You know what? We're pruning this. We're doing the next thing, the next thing." And then having the time to iterate and grow is really critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
So as a leader trying to do this and create space for this, is there something you've learned about how to allow for, "Don't over scrutinize us, don't look at us too carefully. We don't want to be in the limelight. Don't put too many resources on this yet." Is it just like, "Hey, Mark. Here's what I think." I imagine it's not as easy as that. There's a lot of influence and that kind of work. Is there any tactics that you could share to create this sort of environment?

Deb Liu (00:19:59):
I think the most important part of the environment is really patience. And again, this is a portfolio strategy and I tell every PM who... I used to do a new hire PM class and I say, "Look, a lot of you are going to go into the core product and your job is to grow X by 3 to 5% every six months. Growing engagement or growing sessions or maybe growing video views or whatever your metric is, you're trying to grow something 5% and then you exceed expectations."

(00:20:27):
And I said, "And then a bunch of you are like, 'I want to do something new. I want to build something from scratch.'" And I said, "By the way, a very, very successful company for a new set of products has a 50% hit rate. So half of you are going to come back in a year and have a different job because that did not work out. Do you have the resilience to do that?" And I think somebody, you enter a large company... By the way, you can have an amazing career building core products because that is an incredible journey within... Because you learn so much about the mechanics of what that takes.

(00:20:59):
And yet at the same time, I found a lot of energy from doing something that someone hasn't done before. And so I really enjoyed the, "Hey, this thing could fail. Let's pivot. Let's try to figure out. Let's prune this. Let's try that." And not everything I did there succeeded, but a lot of the things that are the lasting products are once that gotten really big. And so for me it was a greater reward and it made a journey so much more interesting.

(00:21:24):
But for others, I think work on the core product, learn the skills. It is absolutely respectable as well. But if you choose to be the person who works on innovation new products, expect in a year, you might literally have nothing to show for it, but the lessons that you learned. And I think those lessons are really precious and we often underestimate that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):
Along those lines, do you think it's a good career move to do a zero to one thing within a bigger company? Or is it often a bad idea? Do you have any advice there for folks?

Deb Liu (00:21:52):
It depends. It depends on your personality in the company. So the one thing I realized about my role was that I did a lot of... I had five different careers at the company over 11 years. And so most people don't realize that when you work on new things, you're constantly adding to your portfolio, subtracting from it, growing things, pruning them. And so you could just work on so many cool things except everything has similar... It's like it rhymes, but it's not exactly the same.

(00:22:19):
So you learn the lessons of how to get things done, how to get resource, how to get support when the product is not working, how to not get prunes in the next culling. And those are really, really important skills. But I think for people who are just starting out of the career, it is a very high risk thing to do. So if you're very early in the career, I encourage people just learn the core skills first. You can learn the core skills when there's a lot of stability. This product is growing X percent, like 5%, and you're going to grow at 10. That's amazing.

(00:22:47):
That is because you are there, you're going to change your trajectory of the product, or this thing has a hundred thousand users, you're going to get it to 200,000. Those are the kinds of things that are going to be successful for you and you can put on your resume. But I think it reaches a point in your career where you have to decide, when am I going to take the big swing? Because the big swings are the things that you write your career stories about. They're not just, I moved this metric X, but I changed your trajectory in this way.

(00:23:17):
And so the big swings though have a lot of failures along the way. And so you have to understand you're making trade-offs in that. I encourage everybody to take some time, two, three years in their career when they're ready for the big swing, where if it doesn't work... If it works, you run the team, you run this amazing product. It doesn't work, you can always go back and go back to the core products.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:39):
It's interesting how your strategy here is very similar to a product portfolio strategy where as a team should have a few big bets and then a lot of incremental stuff. And it reminds me about this awesome post called You Are in Control of Your Career. And the argument in your post is you should PM your career the way you PM your product. So there's a lot of synergy here. So maybe just diving into this post and advice around this, how should someone be PMing their career, the way they PM a product? What's your take there?

Deb Liu (00:24:05):
By the way, for your PM audience, I want to say this, which is a lot of the greatest PMs are the worst PMs of their careers. They love products. They love the crafts. They love the customer research, the data. They have plans, they have timelines. And then when it comes to career, they have none of those things. They just drift from job to job. "Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what's in there? What are your milestones? What are the skills? What are the features that you want to have of your career? How are you going to get there? What does success look like?

(00:24:41):
You actually have metrics for your product, and yet you don't have metrics for your career. I coach a lot of people and when I coach them, I ask them, "Well, where do you want to see yourself in five years? Where do you want to go?" And half the people have no idea. I think that's really tragic because when you PM your career, it's about intentionality. But I'll tell you the story of my career and how I was the accidental PM and then eventually... I told you how I accidentally fell into PM, but also fell into so many of the things that happened in my PM career.

(00:25:10):
And if I had to go back, I would think much more deeply about what I want to accomplish. So I ended up at PayPal working for a guy named Dave Lee who reported to Amy Clement, and then he left. And so she offered me his role. I had only managed people for, I don't know, 15 seconds. I was two years out of business school and I was definitely not qualified to do his job. He was the director of product. I wasn't even a director and I was running the team for eBay.

(00:25:34):
So basically the PayPal part of eBay, which was basically half the company's revenues and profits. Totally unqualified. I ended up in this job and I do a good job. I ended up doing it for several years. I built up the team and we have a great relationship with eBay. Our team was very close and we were able to actually build something really lasting that worked really well. And then I had a baby. And so this happens in a lot of women's careers. I was turning 30, I had my son, and I had to leave for six months.

(00:26:08):
So I handed my product to my successor, Mike Woo and he ended up taking over. He did such a good job while I was gone, I didn't want to displace him when I got back. And so I thought, "Well, I'll go and look for another role." I couldn't really find a product role I liked, I mean, because there weren't that many product director roles. And so I ended up in corporate strategy. So I worked for the amazing Rajiv who was CEO at the time. He since passed and I wrote his speeches, worked on strategies, I worked on digital goods and charity, and ended up building that into a vertical for the company. So charity, social commerce and digital goods.

(00:26:40):
And I thought, "Okay, this is an interesting job." So I create the job, have a couple product managers, wasn't really sure where this was going, and then one day I was like, "You know what? I'm not feeling this. I have a child at home." I had gotten into what Cheryl Sandberg calls that kind of between kids situation where I was bored of my job.

(00:26:59):
I was working one of the VPs I worked with and I resigned. I said, "I'm leaving tech, just I'm going to stay home and maybe start something small." He convinced me to hold off and he said, I'll find you a job. He calls me a week later and he said, "Found you a job with Stephanie Tilenius leading the buyer experience at eBay product." And I said, "Oh, that sounds interesting." So I said, "Sure, as you notice, I do not have a plan. I'm just drifting. I'm so fortunate that I had amazing mentors who gave me opportunities, but end up working for Greg Fant and Stephanie Tilenius at eBay for two years.

(00:27:34):
I led the buyer experience. We did some really good work there. And then went on maternity leave again. And I get a call from a friend, my old engineering manager from PayPal, "Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? You can't come into product. You need a CS degree for that, but we have a product marketing job open." I was like, "Sounds good." Drop into Facebook. And so again, no idea what I'm doing back in product marketing. So I spent a few years doing that. Eventually was invited into product and so on and so forth.

(00:28:02):
And each job that came along was organic, but also kind of accidental. I see that happen in a lot of careers, which is my story when you look back, looks great. It looks like it all worked out, but I had almost zero intentionality in any of these. And I think that had I had more agency and I thought about what I wanted, I could actually measure is this the thing that would get me further or not?

(00:28:24):
I ended up extremely lucky, but not everybody does. And so I think having a plan allows you to compare every decision. It's not like when you're offered an admission to college, we're looking at three different offers maybe with financial aid or not, and you can make a decision, "Oh, they're offering me this department, but I can't get into this department." This is how far it is from home. But jobs and roles or nothing like that. Someone calls you one day, "Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? I'm actually on maternity leave." And he's like, "Just come talk to me." I'm like, "Why not."

(00:29:00):
And you end up dropping into different parts of your life and I think sometimes by saying, "Here's where I want to go and here's how I want to get there," you can have such a better career. And so I do encourage everybody to do this and to think about what does success look like in five years and how far am I from that and am I heading in the right direction?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:20):
What's interesting is I also had a similar path to you where I had zero plan or intention or goal and also just follow things and things worked out. I wonder how often that happens and I wonder if this idea of having intention and planning a roadmap is something you do if things aren't working out because maybe there's some good to not overthinking it and just following pull. I don't know.

Deb Liu (00:29:45):
Well, I think the problem is this with you and me, Lenny, is that hindsight bias is a problem. We made it because we weren't intentional in a lot of ways, but for how many people, is that true? For how many people who aren't... You don't have a plan and you get there. I always tell people, if you are sure what your destination is, that's definitely where you're going to end up. But if you actually aim in the right direction, you can shape your learnings, you can shape your roles you take, you can shape your skills towards the place that you want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:16):
When you talk about getting this offer from Facebook, usually those are like you have three days to decide.

Deb Liu (00:30:21):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):
And it feels like that's when the things you've done ahead of time of here's what I want would be most helpful.

Deb Liu (00:30:29):
Also, I think the thing about job opportunities in particular is they tend to come serially. It's only you presented these offers. It's like one role is so different from another and they often don't happen at the same time. They might say, "Well, you have to decide in two weeks." And then you say, "Well, there's this other company I'm talking to and you get a lot of pressure to say yes to this versus this."

(00:30:49):
And to really having a measuring stick is this getting me closer or further away from where I go? Can allow you to actually take serial decision making to a place where you're measuring against a long-term goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:01):
I did a meditation retreat once and when you're meditating, there's this kind of guidance of don't try too hard, don't push yourself to go into a direction, "Oh, I'm not doing a good job. I need to get to this enlightened state." And instead their advice is just push your cart in a direction and think about that's the direction you want head, but you don't need to grasp on to here's where I need to land, here's where I need to go. And I wonder if just having a thought of here's where I want my career to go. I want to be on boards in the future. I want to start a company in the future. I want to become a designer in the future. At least start there maybe just like a direction that you're heading.

Deb Liu (00:31:40):
Yeah. There's a woman who I worked with in product and now she's the founder, very successful founder, and she said to me, "I want to join the board of this Fortune 100 company." She told me the company, and I said, "Okay, that's a lot." So she said, "How can I get there?" And I said, "First, it's probably going to take you 10 years because look at who's on the board. I happen to know a couple people on the board." And I said, "Why don't I introduce you to one of them? And they can tell you how to get there.

(00:32:04):
But the point is she knew where she wanted to go and she said, "I'm willing to take it first step today." And I said, "First, you've never been on a board. You were very successful, but this is not... There's so many steps before you get there. It's like before you go to Harvard, you have to graduate from elementary school to middle school. You have to take the SAT, you have to apply. I said, "Let's start from the first step and let's break this problem down."

(00:32:29):
But I love that she knew where she wanted to go and she's like, "Even if I don't make it there, I'll be happier having made this journey." And I love that for her. And I think she's still earlier in her career, she has so much time ahead of her, but it's really incredible to see her kind of on this path and to know that that's her dream, and that I can help her a little bit along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
It also relates very much to your idea of thinking of your career like a PM thinks about their product where one of the tactics is to imagine the ideal scenario and work backwards from that versus incrementally what's the next thing? What's the next thing? So in this case, she was thinking, "Here's where I want to head. Okay, what's the next thing to get to that direction?" I love that.

(00:33:53):
Okay, going a slightly different direction, I'd say the post that you've written that has most resonated with me was about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert, and that basically have to learn to be an extrovert as an introvert because in business extroverts are most valued. Can you just talk about of your insight, what you've seen around this and how and your advice to introverts like me about how to be successful in business, what you need to change?

Deb Liu (00:34:22):
Well, first, I love the book, Quiet by Susan Cain. She talks about the power of introverts. Unfortunately, the world doesn't see the way the world the way she does. I wrote this post. It was the secret bias no one talks about, which is the workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. And I tell the story of somebody on my team who's just an amazing product manager, and yet every time she came up for promotion or calibration, people were like, "Oh, what does she do?" And it was because she was not good at broadcasting or explaining what she does.

(00:34:54):
I would take her to executive meetings and she was really bad at answering questions or talking. And so we would prep and prep and prep. I just knew her skills and I could see her every day moving the product forward. But for some reason people... Because your peers also have influence over people's ratings and their promotions, and I was constantly just trying to figure out how to get them to see her brilliance. I asked her once, I said, "I noticed that you never answer questions when we do these presentations." She's like, "Yeah, because I'm a processor. And by the time I process, I feel like the conversation has moved on."

(00:35:28):
And so I really feel like the world, it's not built for somebody like her who's a brilliant product leader, but people couldn't see it. And I realized that so much of what products and just general leadership is, is not just doing the work, but actually... It's not just having the product, it's having great product marketing to go with it. Let's call it that. Okay, so I've been in product and I've been product marketing. You make a light bulb, but you're selling light.

(00:35:53):
I really think about how that she was making amazing number of light bulbs. She was lighting up all the houses, but she was not marketing the light. And I think that was the thing that was really missing. Is that fair? Absolutely not. There are a lot of people who are born introverted. Is it fair that a product manager who isn't introverted, isn't extroverted is struggling with that? No, but that's the world we live in. And so it's one of those things where you get to choose what you do.

# What it takes to become a top 1% PM | Ian McAllister (Uber, Amazon, Airbnb)

## Transcript

Ian McAllister (00:00:00):
If you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion, or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can, or if you're a leader trying to use your team to have the biggest impact you can in the company, how you do every part of your day, that's a really good guiding light.

Lenny (00:00:22):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Ian McAllister. Ian is the author of one of the most classic posts on product management, What Separates a Top 1% PM from a Top 10% PM, amongst many other pieces of writing that he shared online. Ian has managed over 100 product managers in his career. He spent 12 years at Amazon where he built Amazon Smile and led the team responsible for growing Alexa internationally. He also worked at Airbnb with me and now he's at Uber leading global product for the vehicles platform, which includes making Uber's fleet increasingly electric and autonomous. In our conversation, we focus primarily on two topics. What separates a top 1% PM from everyone else, specifically for new PMs and also for senior PMs. And we also dig deep into the working backwards process. We get into how you can implement the process on your team and how you might be doing it wrong. There's also a bunch of links to templates and guides in the show notes, so if you want to follow along, definitely check those out. With that, I bring you Ian McAllister.

This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris and Lex Friedman, and so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies and internal testing that they do.

Lenny (00:03:13):
And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. To take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

Lenny (00:03:55):
Ian, welcome to the podcast.

Ian McAllister (00:03:57):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. I've been looking forward to this.

Lenny (00:03:59):
Me too. I'm sure you hear this a lot, but when I was a new product manager, a very new PM, the post that you wrote on what makes a top 1% product manager was really influential and really helped me figure out what to focus on and what skills are really important. And I find that it continues to live on as this very legendary post for product managers who are trying to figure out what to do. And I just reread it in prep for this post and I was just like, wow, this is ... Now that I'm on the other side, I'm like, this is so right. And so I'm really excited to dig into a lot of these things in person, virtually in person, and with you. So thank you again for doing this.

Ian McAllister (00:04:35):
Yeah. Man, it's awesome. I'm excited just to spend some time talking with you about product and we'll see what happens.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Did you expect the impact that this post had when you were writing it, when you were just putting this together, the impact that the post had in your career or just the PM industry?

Ian McAllister (00:04:51):
Definitely not. I used to lurk on Quora at the time and then I was just having fun reading things and answering some questions and I used to look for questions in the Goldilocks zone. They weren't too high level of abstract like how do you be a good problem, but they weren't too super specific and this one was kind of right in the middle. And so I'd pluck off a couple of those and I think more as a way to structure my own thoughts, that was what was interesting and fun for me to do that. Not because I thought it'd have any kind of real reach. But obviously it's been cool to see that people reference it pretty often and that's been pretty fun.

Lenny (00:05:23):
We'll link to this in the show notes. If folks that are listening don't know what we're talking about, we'll link to it and you can check it all out. And we're going to be talking about a lot of this stuff in the actual chat, but there's a couple things there that are worth maybe drilling in on a little bit. One is just the impact that writing on the internet can have on someone's career. This one post I imagine had a lot of impact on the trajectory of your career. Is there something you could share there? Is that true?

Ian McAllister (00:05:45):
Yeah, it did. And there's another post, I think it was before this one, someone just asked about Amazon's product development process and so I wrote about the working backwards process. Which isn't my process. I just used it and just described it and just kind of caught on a little bit there as well. I think those two, and then I started to write more about people management and product management. And I think the value for me was so awesome just to make connections with people in the industry and it felt like this is, I guess, the 2010 or something like this where a lot of Amazon people I of thought were just so 100% heads down. It was a little bit of a secretive culture, not maybe like Apple, but it was pretty private. But I was interested in the startup community and product in general and so I think I spent a little time trying to engage with folks and I just made so many great connections and relationships from this.

Ian McAllister (00:06:39):
I remember interacting with you and getting to know Joebot and other folks at Airbnb early on even before I joined. But obviously I'd credit this work and those relationships for me ultimately going there and so many great relationships and people I've met because of it. And aside from just the little positive feedback, I mean people tweet at me periodically, be like, "Hey, by the way, just love this post," and whatever. And so it's super gratifying.

Lenny (00:07:03):
You mentioned a little bit about your background and we're about to get into that and I want you to share all the things you've done. But the other piece there that I think is interesting that comes up again and again in the power of writing is it often just starts with you trying to collect your thoughts and putting it out there and ends up, wow, so many people find that valuable and it spreads. And so that's just a really simple way of thinking about if you're starting to write online, just summarize something that you've been thinking about that you want to just crystallize in your own head. There's this quote that's probably falsely attributed to Mark Twain and Hemingway often of just like, I don't know what I've thought until I've written it down. And that's super true with these things and so that's a good example of this.

Ian McAllister (00:07:42):
And I think with any kind of writing, it was probably less structured initially, but I would, partially because I was trying to share something for an external audience, try to just organize it and make it compact and not too wordy or rambling. And I think business writing, I spent a lot of that time doing that at Amazon, is so valuable because you've got to be a clear thinker to be a clear communicator. And so there's two tests in writing well or communicating well. It's both those things. So I found it's pretty valuable in kind of sharpening your ax.

Lenny (00:08:15):
So these are the two things we're going to focus our chat on is what makes a top 1% product manager and then the Amazon way of working and especially working backwards. So these are all good cues for where we're going. But before we get there, can you just spend just a minute giving us a sense of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're up to now?

Ian McAllister (00:08:31):
Well, I can tell you what I have done. I'll let others decide what's wonderful or not. So after doing finance and economics in school, I made the logical choice and I got a job doing marketing in the beer industry and then the next logical choice, I moved to Tokyo and I bootstrapped my way into software development without knowing Japanese or software development. Did that for a few years, came back to the states working as a developer at a startup and then kind of a midsize company and then moved to Microsoft as a program manager, pretty much a product manager. The same thing there in that role. Learned some good stuff and then made a connection with Amazon and moved there 2006. And that was really the start of when I think about building my product toolbox and leadership toolbox. So few different things I did over 12 years, a few years in retail and conversion.

Ian McAllister (00:09:22):
I then moved in traffic and direct traffic loyalty when I created Amazon Smile. The role in Alexa. I led Alexa International, so scaling Alexa and Echo to six more countries. And the last role in delivery experience and operations. So I led a number of different programs there and then recently joined Uber where I'm a senior director of product and tech for vehicles. So that means everything, all the tools that help fleets and rental companies make their vehicles accessible to Uber drivers so they can earn. Sustainability tech and electrification, our vehicle platform, and then creating a path for autonomous vehicles to come onto the platform. And that's it.

Lenny (00:10:03):
Amazing. I just realized this one thread through your career is autonomy and AI a little bit, right? With Alexa and then with Uber, with these autonomous cars stuff you're working on now. Is that something realized or is that an accident?

Ian McAllister (00:10:18):
Well, I mean I guess you could connect those things. Obviously both are machine learning, AI. The way I think about it is that I've done a whole bunch of different lifetimes, especially around eCommerce, and so it allows me to cover the gamut. Plus, I guess I forgot to mention the time at Airbnb working with Joebot and you and Vlad and Dan and Shirley and there was focused on building out the customer support technology platform. So that's another part of the eCommerce platform. Covers the gamut.

Lenny (00:10:45):
I forgot to bring that up too. I'm glad you touched on that.

Ian McAllister (00:10:48):
I don't know how I missed that. I guess I skipped past that with the Amazon stuff.

Lenny (00:10:50):
The most transformative time getting to work together.

Ian McAllister (00:10:53):
That was awesome. That was awesome. I learned a lot from you too during that time.

Lenny (00:10:56):
What a time. This is a good time to chat about, speaking of Airbnb and all that, to chat about what makes a top 1% product manager. So I know your post was really titled what separates a 1% PM from a 10% PM, but it feels like it's even broader, just like how do you become a top 1% product manager. And I thought maybe a good way to start here is maybe just run through the attributes that you've found over the years or here's the things that a top 1% PM needs to get great at. Maybe just run through them and then we'll talk through them in a little more detail.

Ian McAllister (00:11:28):
Yeah, I was going to pull up my post here so I could actually refer to it. Do you want me to go through all of them or just pick out a couple to touch on?

Lenny (00:11:33):
Let's maybe just go through them quickly just to put them out there and then I'll have some follow up questions to dig into a few of them.

Ian McAllister (00:11:40):
All right, sounds good. Well, the way I listed it at the time, think big. Always want to hunt for bigger impact. Communicate, I think we'll probably touch on that a little bit. It's super important for PMs as a test of their thinking and their communication. Simplify. How you can do more with less and have more impact. Simplifying is a great way to do that. Prioritize. That's I think the core skill after communication of a PM and there's so many different lenses to view that. Let's see here. Forecasting and measuring. I think that it's really important. What separates product managers from consultants sometimes is you forecast and then you execute and then you measure and validate and that helps you build your instincts. Just obviously the core execution of just shipping and doing what you said you do. Understanding technical trade offs is that you don't have to be a software engineer to be a great PM, but the more you learn about technical trade offs, not just product and customer trade offs, that will help you simplify and get more yield out of your resources.

Ian McAllister (00:12:40):
Understanding good design. If you're working on anything customer focused, that's always going to help you think in the mind of a customer or user. You don't need to design, but the more you understand helps. Writing effective copy. This goes a long way not to get close and not to sub out the copy to somebody else, but to get good at communicating with a couple words to your customers. That's a great skill. Those were the ones that I wrote at the time, I guess 10 years ago, and then I refreshed the post recently in my newsletter. And I added a couple new ones honestly, because as I reflected back, there was a few that I think a lot about these days that I missed the first time around. Earn trust with others. That's so important as a PM, but especially if you're going to grow as a product leader becomes even more important.

Ian McAllister (00:13:29):
And I think trust is the currency of a product manager and a product leader, especially if you're going to grow in your career. Digging for data. It's out there and you got to develop the tools to go find it. Not to depend on your analyst or what's in the reports today. So that's a really important skill for anyone in product. And probably the more junior you are, the more important it is as you're really in the weeds there building product. Pushing back effectively. This is an art and a skill, but I think your ability to do this is pretty correlated with your ability to grow and succeed as a leader. Because if you say yes to everything, you're going to go nowhere. Adapting to change. How you react to change will obviously impact one, your mood and your morale, as well as how effectively you can rally yourself, your team. And then driven by impact, not promotion. Ultimately that's what you want to wake up every day thinking about how to have an impact for your business and that will be an indicator on your likelihood of promotion. So do that instead of just focusing on how to get promoted and having that guide your day.

Lenny (00:14:33):
Awesome. So it's a long list. There's a lot that a PM needs to be good at, which I think if you're a PM you already know. It's a wild, crazy, impossible job to have everything nailed down. And at the end of this post even mention you've never met a 1% PM that does all these things. And I think that's important. No one's going to be the best at all these things. And so just to drill down a little bit and get a little more focused. Say you're a new product manager. Of these, I forget how many there, maybe 10, 12, what are the top three that you think new PMs should get most good at and focus on?

Ian McAllister (00:15:06):
Probably communicate, prioritize, and execute. I think those are just the core building blocks. Other ones will be more important as you grow and become more senior, but those ones, no matter where you are in your product career I think are super important. Being a better communicator is something I've been working on my entire product career and I'll be working on until the day I stop. And I remember years ago I was at Microsoft, my first effectively product manager role and my product unit manager, Thomas, came by the office and I think he asked me, "When is this going to ship?" And I was like, "Well, this thing is taking a little bit longer here and this other thing and yada yada." And I gave a bunch of background, but I didn't really answer the question. And I got a little feedback from him like, that's not really the ... Ultimately he's waiting for a date.

Ian McAllister (00:15:53):
And so I just reflected on that and that was, as I remember, my journey to try to be a better communicator over time and I'm still on it. When I went to Amazon, I worked for Kim Rackmiller who was our, I think at the time, SVP for Worldwide Discovery. And I think she was Amazon's first TPM. And she was tough but super smart. And so that was also an early experience to learn from her. And sometimes you get some feedback when you didn't really answer the question. And my first boss, Russell and I organized and started to gather this thing called the Book of Kim. And so we would gather these best practices that we learned from her elsewhere. Avoid weasel words, answer first and then explain, own your problems. And started building this.

Ian McAllister (00:16:36):
And then I extended that over time and added a bunch more and wrote a post called the Operators Manual. I tried to gather all these things together. But it's such an important thing and the stakes get higher as you work with more and more senior people. But if you can get in the habit early of answering a when question with a date, knowing how to use numbers to answer questions and honestly just learning from feedback and grade yourself after you get feedback on a doc or after a meeting or after answering a question in an elevator. And if you try to say, "Gosh, how could I have done that better?," and then try to get better, you can. And you can go far if you just focus on that and all the other 150 skills of a product manager, but if you don't have that, it's unlikely that you're going to really go too far in your product career.

Ian McAllister (00:17:24):
So that was communicate. I guess prioritize as the next one. And so I think this is the number one key tool of a product manager is prioritization. Because so many things come from being good at prioritizing. And it's not just what project do you do next or do you do this project or that project. There's so many different dimensions to prioritization. There's which themes are you going to prioritize in a roadmap and which projects within a theme and how are you going to sequence those projects, how much of a project you're going to build. And also just time management is also a prioritization function. Like what are you going to choose to spend your time on? Which things are you going to really go all out to make great and which things are you going to starve for attention or just not do? Given the same amount of skill intelligence and resources, a product manager with a great innate ability to prioritize is going to generate 5X the impact of someone without that skill.

Ian McAllister (00:18:18):
My early, if you could call it success at Amazon, I think was completely dependent. It wasn't because I worked smarter or I was smarter, I worked longer hours or I was more technical than other people. I think it was just because I was one, super hungry for impact. And if there was a number or a metric that measured success at the business I was running, I wanted that to go up and to the right. Not to hit a goal, but just to go as far and as fast up to the right as possible. And if anything, it was just working with a team to hone in on the projects that would do that with the greatest leverage and just marshaling all the team's resources. So that was a good start. That was a fit with Amazon in terms of working backwards from a fitness function or a metric.

Ian McAllister (00:19:01):
And so did that with the first team I was there and then again later managed the gifting business. And so it just was one skill that I think helped me as well as make up for maybe some deficiencies I'd had. I don't have the biggest brain in the world and I don't have the biggest working memory and I wasn't the most technical, but by trying to really get good at that prioritization, I think that's helped me and it still does.

Ian McAllister (00:19:23):
I think execute is the third one, which is no surprise that every PM has to execute. And I think assuming you prioritize well then execution means sort of molding what you want to build into a simple compact package that has the highest impact possible. And then also execution's a big function of the team you're working with. So it's your designers and your data science folks, and especially your engineers.

Ian McAllister (00:19:47):
So anything to do with how well they're doing their jobs or how well they're resourced or whether they're getting better and better at every sprint, you have some amount of ownership in helping make that happen because that directly impacts your team's ability to execute and ultimately your reputation as well for being able to execute. The drive that goes into execution, product managers are the mode of power behind execution and impact. And if you stall out or you don't do your job, the project's probably going to stall out as well. And so you're the ones, especially with a TPM, if you're lucky enough to have one in the back of the ship, kind of beating the drum and driving everyone forward. But again, lots of people have written a lot of stuff about execution and there's a lot to it, but I think those are probably the three I'd focus on.

Lenny (00:20:32):
Awesome. And what's interesting about these three is if you look at the rest of the list, think big, understand technical trade offs, understand good design, I think what I would take away from this is those are the things you don't need to focus on that much when you're a new PM. Focus on, as you said, communication, prioritizing, executing. Focus less on these other things because later they'll become more and more important and obviously learn as much as you can, but it's almost bit easier to think about the things you don't need to stress about when you're starting out.

Ian McAllister (00:21:02):
Yeah, I think that makes sense. If there's a core or think about in year one as a PM, focusing on those things. And you can develop other skills over time. But yeah, I think you're spot on there.

Lenny (00:21:14):
If we were to go back through these three, just maybe as a last question, and you may not have an answer to this, but if you think about communicating, prioritizing, and executing, is there one tactical thing you could suggest that a PM listening to this can do to get better at one of these things? Is there a trick you've learned of, wow, this is one way you could level up communicating, executing, prioritizing or not?

Ian McAllister (00:21:37):
The closest thing to a checklist, the post I mentioned, the Operator's Manual, that was the closest thing to, if you do these things, these specific actions, I think it'll go a long way. Because a lot of them are guided around not doing the easy pitfalls and communication mistakes like rambling. If you're asked a question and you explain and then maybe you get to the answer, if you just think, answer and then explain or sometimes answer and then shut up, that actually is a tactical thing you can do to get better at communicating. And there's some other tips in there as well. So that was my attempt to try to encode, to take some of the ones that we gathered early at Amazon, add some more. The others are ... Yeah. There's no just simple trick unfortunately to prioritize other than ... I mean I think working backwards is a good technique to have impact to guide your prioritization. And that is something where it's not a simple tip, but there's a set of practices and behaviors that you can do that will ultimately lead you to prioritize better.

Lenny (00:22:39):
Awesome. We'll talk about all that.

Ian McAllister (00:22:40):
And then I think communication, the simple tip was just grade yourself after you communicate and try to just take a moment and after a while you'll just do it naturally to think about, "Gosh, how would I have answered that question better?" And so the next time you could try to answer that question better and it's just a continuous improvement process.

Lenny (00:22:58):
Or maybe even ask your manager, "Hey, what could I have done better in terms of how I communicated in that last meeting or that last email?"

Ian McAllister (00:23:04):
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

Lenny (00:23:06):
Okay, so then coming at it from the other direction, say you're a senior PM, what are three of these attributes that you would suggest folks focus on to get better and level up in their career?

Ian McAllister (00:23:17):
Gosh, it's still communicate, to be honest. I think that's the one at every level of product, just the stakes are higher. I think think big is one for sure. There was a phrase I think Warren Buffett in the Berkshire Hathaway letter used at some point. Was at our scale we got to hunt for bigger elephants. And so I think at any scale as a PM, whatever your idea is or whatever your solution or the problem you're solving, take a minute at the beginning to say, could this be bigger? Could this be a bigger thing and more impactful than the initial idea, even if the initial idea sounds big? So that's a tool and that's often where I'd start when my PMs were sharing an idea is I'd try to expand it to the degree it might be expanded, think about it from that perspective and then maybe you want to still start small, but with a bigger vision in mind.

Ian McAllister (00:24:04):
Earn trust is a huge one and that's kind of why I added it more recently. And it becomes even more important as you get into senior roles because I think it's truly the currency of a product leader or probably any leader in any function. Because if you want to ask for more resources to do something bigger, if your leadership doesn't trust you to use those resources well or do what you said you're going to do, you're probably not going to get them. But if you've built trust that you're a good steward of resources and you make a lot of impact with a given team, that's directly going to correlate with your ability to gain more resources. Trust is just built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations. And I think that's a good mantra to think about as a FM. Am I meeting the expectations that I set? And not just doing good things, but calling your shots, forecasting, setting a goal, and then hitting it.

Ian McAllister (00:24:54):
And if you do that repeatedly, you're going to be in pretty good shape. And there's so many practices as a product manager or product leader that build trust. You tell the truth without fail. And you launch when you say you'd launch and you launch what you said you'd launch and you own your mistakes. And then the other practices just lose trust. If you lie or if you're evasive, if you don't ship what you said you're going to do, if you ignore your mistakes or you repeat them. And so I think just simply having high standards for yourself and think of trust as that currency, that's going to correlate well as a PM, as a GPM or director of product in any level, that's the thing that you want to build.

Lenny (00:25:34):
So thinking big, building trust. Was there a third?

Ian McAllister (00:25:37):
I think maybe the last one, which is certainly relevant for a PM but is really true as well, is driven by impact. And if you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can, or if you're a leader trying to use your team to have the biggest impact you can in the company, which will influence how you build your roadmap and how you do every part of your day, that's a really good guiding light. And I remember in my first 10 years at Amazon, just naturally not because I thought about it, I was just hungry to have an impact. Take my business, grow it as fast as possible. I wasn't maybe loosely thinking about promotion, but I wasn't thinking about it. I never talked to my manager about it and I wasn't bringing it up. I was just focused on taking my book of business and making it bigger. And then the net result was I was promoted several times and I did grow in my role, but that wasn't what drove me. It was just the impact.

Lenny (00:26:38):
Would you say that driving impact is more important for a new PM or senior PM? It feels like impact is the soup within which all PMs swim and that's constantly important, but it's interesting that you mostly put that into the latter part of a career. Do you feel like with new PMs on your team you're less expecting them to think about impact and focus on impact?

Ian McAllister (00:27:01):
Well, I mean I think for junior PMs, if you're a brand new PM, then yeah, you want to have an impact, but you're really just ... You have a project or a feature to ship or something like that and you're often not necessarily given a lot of latitude to build your own roadmap. But you're asked to ship this. So you want to spec it, you want to execute and do it. But increasingly as you grow, there are opportunities to sense out and try to have a bigger impact maybe and then start to influence prioritization or roadmaps. It's just that the expectations, it goes from being a nice to have as a junior or first time PM to as you get a little more senior, hopefully if things work the way they should work, that's really how you're evaluated. Yes, you want to treat your team well and you want to do a whole bunch of other things, but take two people, one has a massive impact on the business and one who doesn't, then the right way to work should be that first person should be the one that grows and develops and is tasked and with bigger challenges just because if you're impactful at a bigger challenge, that's even more important for the business. So I think that's a good way to think about the flywheel of product leadership.

Lenny (00:28:11):
It feels like a lot of times you get lucky as a new PM. You work on a project that ends up having a lot of impact that you didn't necessarily drive. You just happen to work on something that, wow, this was a huge deal and that feels like an important thing to optimize for a little in your early career is work on something that's likely to have a lot of impact even if you're not responsible for setting the strategy and prioritizing.

Ian McAllister (00:28:29):
Well, I think that's true if you have a choice in where you work in product. If you have a choice to work on something that's part of offense, something that drives the business. And it's true that executives wake up if something drives dollars or customers or offense things and it just maybe shouldn't be this way, but a little less interested in things that maybe less than a risk that just the risk never happens, it comes to pass or a cost center that operates a little more efficiently. So that it's one lens where that might relate to your success. I think also who you work for. And I think most of us don't get to choose that especially early in our career. It either works out in your favor and which is great and that was the case for me, especially at Amazon, some of the leaders I worked with. But sometimes it doesn't. But I think the more that you can suss out who you work for because then the better they are at these skills and prioritizing, one, they're just going to be a better teacher and a better role model to learn from. So I think that's an important thing to think about in any kind of job change.

Lenny (00:29:30):
To close the loop on this piece for more senior PMs, the skills to focus on, you said, thinking big, building trust and driving impact. I'll put you on the spot. I'll give you two options, two directions to go with this. One is if you want to get better at each of these three things, do you have any one thing someone could do or what does great look like for thinking big or building trust or driving impact? Those are two options.

Ian McAllister (00:29:58):
That was six questions there Lenny. Let me see here what I'm answering. Well, I think the think big one is interesting and one way to think about thinking big, especially as you grow in your career is most people operate within a box. There's a box of there's product management and these are the things that product managers do. And you basically build a roadmap and you prioritize features and you work with eng. And so that might be the typical kind of product scope and tech. Most of my roles were ones where I was kind of a GM but a really product focused GM and so I naturally found myself taking a much wider view of what product is across disciplines. And I was lucky enough that I had engineering teams and marketers and analysts and other folks and so that helped me. But I think as a PM you can still do that, even if those functions don't report to you, is take that really wide view of what success for your product is and not have the blinders on its product or tech.

Ian McAllister (00:30:58):
It's anything. It's anything that influences the success and your customers' success or anything else. And it just means, you don't own marketing or you don't own this other function, but you own it until you find somebody else to own it. And so that's not necessarily thinking big in terms of scale or whatever, but in terms of how you think about your role as a PM and what your ownership responsibility is. And so I think just the more that you ... You don't want to get over your skis as a PM and then you're trying to change your CFO's mind about something necessarily. But the more you grow, that you have to increasingly do that and find the constraints or barriers to your success or your product success and knock them down no matter what they are.

Lenny (00:31:43):
Yeah. It makes me think about just the advice of think like an owner, think beyond just your one little bubble, think about the broader business outside of the one little product you might be working on. So that's great advice.

Lenny (00:33:08):
Before we move on to the working backwards piece, which I'm excited to get into, is there anything else you want to share on this thread?

Ian McAllister (00:33:15):
I might just talk about earn trust because this is one that I didn't put in there initially and I honestly don't think that I recognized the importance of it early on in my career or even in the middle of my career and it's been in the last couple years that I really understood the importance of it. My wife Sarah is a product manager in AWS and so as I've mentored her a little bit in her career and I've seen how this is really a superpower for her, it really made me reflect like, what are the things I could have done better in different roles to earn trust more? And it's not just the basic things like to be honest and tell two different people the same thing versus different things. I think it's trying to really understand, work backwards from that person and what are their goals and what are their organization's goals and honestly spend the time and the energy to try to get to alignment in the same place.

Ian McAllister (00:34:09):
And be willing, not just bullheaded, which I might have been earlier in my career, maybe still to many people, but charging forth what do I think's right but taking some more time to try to forge an alliance with someone because if you do that you're ultimately going to be more successful. So that was just one that I was probably slow to recognize the importance of and I'm trying to catch up now.

Lenny (00:34:30):
Is there a story that comes to mind where you look back and I should have earned trust there or I broke some trust here that you'd be willing to share?

Ian McAllister (00:34:39):
When I was working with you and the team at Airbnb, I think this is one where Joebot brought me on to help build out the customer support technology platform maybe more how Amazon would do it. To maintain a high level of quality but to become more efficient as well and to reduce the cost so that Airbnb wouldn't have to scale customer support this to the same degree the business was scaling. And so trying to build a new team and develop and I was pretty heads down doing it the way I thought it should be done and working with the team there in terms of let's get a strong analytics framework. Let's measure all these things and really understand what's going on at the data level and then let's use the same prioritization muscles that had made me successful at Amazon to prioritize things that were best worked backwards.

Ian McAllister (00:35:26):
And I think that what I didn't do as much as I should have is obviously really partnering with the customer support leadership team as well. That was something where I think in some ways it felt like we were in alignment and getting on stage together and stuff, but it turned out I maybe hadn't spent as much time and effort on that as I thought to build that true support there such that that leader would rally the organization around it as well and we'd be marching in the same beat. And so that was something that I would reflect. Now, I think the team did amazing things and Shirley really carrying the torch there in the entire team and so accomplished a lot. But that was a learning about ... Going back, I probably would've spent more time and really tried to do even more on that.

Lenny (00:36:12):
Thanks for sharing that. I never knew that story. And it sounds like the takeaway there is maybe don't take for granted the leadership team, the team that'll actually be using the product. Is that a roughly way to think about it?

Ian McAllister (00:36:23):
Well I would say that if you have a certain approach you may be believe it's the right one and it may be the right one, but if you don't build the support and the relationships that they're going to help carry that out and execute on that strategy, it may not get executed as well as you think it should be. And so that's an important part of success. It's a risk that you have to mitigate. And trying to earn trust and to do it that way is a way to mitigate that risk that the right product and the right direction and the right strategy, it may not land if you don't have that support that you need. And so that I think was my learning.

Lenny (00:37:00):
What better way to learn a lesson than get some wrong and then you never forget it again.

Ian McAllister (00:37:06):
You could call it getting wrong. Just think of something I could have done better. And just that same continuous improvement mindset. It's to everything, every role, every experience, every project, every communication. And if you build that muscle to try to do it better the next time and also just the try to be a little self aware about what could have gone better, then I think it's a really good muscle to build.

Lenny (00:37:27):
This is a good segue to the second area of where our chat is going to go, which is Amazon and things you've learned about just the working backwards process. How many years did you say you worked at Amazon total?

Ian McAllister (00:37:38):
12 years.

Lenny (00:37:39):
12 years. It feels like everyone that worked at Amazon is 10 years or more. It's these large numbers. So they must be doing something right and I don't know. What do you think that is actually? Why do people stay there so long? It's amazing.

Ian McAllister (00:37:52):
What's interesting about Amazon, and it's changed over time, is that I think pretty quickly whether you're a fit for it or not. And it can be kind of a crucible and a little spartan. And it just clicked with me though because I'm kind of a structured thinker and right brain. And so this idea that hey, I could have this business and then figure out one metric or fitness function that determines success and then my job is to make that number go up and to the right. That kind of fit with me. And then I rewired my brain probably over the first 10 years around this concept and I just felt like I was learning, I was not only working with smart people that were driven, which was true at Microsoft as well, but there was kind of this DNA in the organization and this wiring that I thought was really effective and it just kind of clicked with me.

Ian McAllister (00:38:44):
And so I molded myself to the environment and at every step of the way I felt like I was learning and growing and one of the benefits for me is you get a chance to learn from so many other people in these different settings. You get the chance to read documents that make you learn more so than probably a slide deck. You get a chance to be in weekly business reviews with really smart people and learn from that. Not just learn from your own experience but from everyone else in that room. So I was just a sponge and so much learning happening that I think propelled my career. And so that was why, especially the first 10 years, that it was so fantastic of just growing and feeling yourself build these new muscles and develop these new tools and I loved it. So that was why I stayed so long and obviously Airbnb then, it was the time to try something new, which was a great experience and kind of a test. I was in Seattle and the company was in San Francisco and spending three days on a road each week was a good learning and ultimately a reason to come back and be Seattle based. But then I chose Amazon again because it was still a great place and I thought I could continue to learn.

Lenny (00:39:52):
Awesome. I was going to mention they drew you back in. So yeah, that's pretty rare. What did you learn from folks like Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilke about building product leadership, company building? What's stuck with you working with folks like?

Ian McAllister (00:40:04):
I would say two very different people but complimented themselves so well. I didn't have hundreds of meetings with Jeff Bezos while I was there, but I did have a chance, especially in the development of Amazon Smile and then early when I started the social team to have some of those meetings where I wrote the doc and it was Jeff and 10 other people reviewing. The process of doing, even before hitting on Amazon Smile, it was really kind of a innovation process I guess you could call it, where we had a goal in mind to increase customers' loyalty to Amazon, their direct traffic loyalty, not in the way Prime did, which is a paid program, but to try to come up with another program or way in which customers might start their shopping on Amazon instead of elsewhere. And so I was running the gifting business. I moved over to the traffic org to try to come up with a new program with no team or anything.

Ian McAllister (00:40:58):
And then I would meet with Jeff Bezos and Wilke and others every couple months and I would profile a couple different options and use the working backwards process and we'd review some facts. And so there was a bunch of learnings throughout that process. One, I found Jeff to be super encouraging. And each time we'd leave one of those meetings, we maybe didn't find the thing in that meeting. We'd talk about it and brainstorm a little bit, but he would always leave and be encouraging and with a quote. One time he was like, "Remember, this process doesn't have to be efficient because the prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going." And then he'd leave the room and whatever. So I found the rhetoric around Jeff or blowing up or whatever, I didn't find any of that and I found him to be super encouraging and he found all these times to help train me in the working backwards process.

Ian McAllister (00:41:52):
There was a time when I came with a press release for a concept and it didn't have a problem paragraph. I'd skipped that. And he reviewed it and so forth and he was like, "You know what, maybe if you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem." And so it was kind of a little lesson to me like, "Yeah, maybe that is why I did it. I wasn't really working backwards, I kind of had the solution in mind and so I'd skipped over that part." So that was one just very specific learning about the process from Jeff. So Jeff Wilke, I probably learned more from Wilke just because I had more exposure over my time there. At one point he was my skip level. And I have such tremendous respect for Wilke or Jaw as he was called internally because he was sort of the consummate operator.

Ian McAllister (00:42:34):
This muscle that I think you learn working at Amazon about being an operator, whether you're ... You're not in operations, but any part of the business that I think came from him. And I think it was due to him that Amazon developed that muscle. And I think it's one way that separates some Amazon PMs from people who haven't worked there in that environment and that continuous improvement mindset. That's so important. And one of the forums that was a great learning was the WBR or Weekly Business Review. Or later called Consumer Business Review. So this was a forum where Jeff would lead the meeting. It would be a series of metrics for different parts of the business. Everywhere from fulfillment to customer support, to traffic to category teams to programs. And I would present on Amazon Smile there. And the way he would run that meeting and enable you to get through a metrics meeting for the entire North American retail business in one hour.

Ian McAllister (00:43:27):
And the way he ran that meeting would lead all those leaders to build these muscles because you wanted to be prepared to speak to the variances or trends in your business in a key metric and know your business and know what you were doing based on that thing. And so just this hour a week of probing and asking questions and everyone ... There might be a hundred people in that room prepared to answer questions about your business. And it had this cascading effect that not only was I or the leaders there on the spot having to answer a question and being prepared, but then I would do the same thing with my team, et cetera. And so I was trying to build those muscles in my team such that they could bring their insights and understanding and actions on things in this cascading effect. So that was a mechanism, which is another really big thing at Amazon that led to all these amazing behaviors.

Ian McAllister (00:44:17):
And I think a lot of those mechanisms came from Jeff Wilke or he created an environment where they would be developed throughout the organization and then propagated. And so that was one thing, just that operational mindset and rigor that being a product leader is not just about building new things, it's about how well you run what you've already built. And if you're really paying attention to the product that you operate, it will give you ideas for things you could do to double down on something that's happening well or to prevent something bad happening. And I think that's been a very key reason for Amazon's scale. Another thing I really respect about Jeff Wilke, and I think Doug Harrington has some of this as well, is the notion of a little bit of tough love. And I think that's important and that neither were assholes, but sometimes, and especially Wilke, you need to get that look kind of like your dad might look over his glasses at you and be like, "Hey."

Ian McAllister (00:45:15):
And so I think that was kind of the vibe that you would get. It was professional, it was respectful, but sometimes everyone needs a little kick in the ass and I think that was something, but it almost builds more respect from him and just incredible leaderly behavior, which I really respect and I try to model and I try to do the same because I respected it so much. And then I guess the last attribute of Wilke, which I really saw was teaching. And it wasn't just saying this is the right thing or this is what my decision is in a meeting, but teaching the why and the pattern, the mental model that informs him to think this is the right thing. And so I think he was just great at teaching, taking a moment. It might just take 10 seconds in a meeting to teach.

Ian McAllister (00:46:01):
And that's something that I've forgotten at different parts of my career, especially as you get more experienced and you know the right decision to do and you know what you want, whatever, that may be the right thing, but I think you'll have a lot more lasting effect if you could abstract it to a degree and teach the lesson. Because then that person will hopefully learn the lesson and can apply it to a bunch of future situations and also understand the why more. And it helps them sometimes disagree and commit more so than just being given prescriptive advice.

Lenny (00:46:33):
Sounds like it must have been an incredible experience learning from these two. Thanks for sharing all that. I want to get to the working backwards stuff. I feel like we've talked about this a lot. We've talked about this on other podcasts with other guests. I feel like people understand the general idea. Yeah, Amazon works backwards. They write a PR. Maybe there's a six pager thing they do. But I feel like there's not a lot of, here's how actually do this thing. And so just to spend a little time on this, when you see teams trying to work backwards and be like, "Let's work backwards. We're going to be like Amazon.", what do you find they do wrong when they're actually trying to implement this idea of working backwards? What's the most common mistake do you find?

Ian McAllister (00:47:11):
Well, working backwards is all about the problem and starting there and obsessing about the problem and being guided by it to then go into the solution. So when teams that do it wrong is they don't do that. They don't work backwards. They have something they want to build. These things look similar. These two technologies or whatever. We could combine them and then do this. And if you say we could and it's not grounded in a customer or customer's problem, you're not working backwards. And then you may use "the working backwards process", but you already have the solution. And so you're adding the problem after the solution. You're retrofitting the problem, retrofitting the customer. And so that I think is the number one thing is that they don't get the importance of truly starting with the problem that you're trying to solve and being faithful to that working backwards from the problem.

Ian McAllister (00:48:03):
When I first started at Amazon and community, we had this business of automated merchandising using community content, and that was the core thing we were doing is to grow that. But there was this Jeff idea that a team was super excited about. Because I think in some meeting he'd kind of sketched it out or whatever. And so that there was already all this momentum to build this thing that was actually a Jeff project, but I should have known at the time, in hindsight I do, because the name they had for this project was ASIN to ASIN linking. And ASIN was the identifier for a product on Amazon. And so it was kind of this not working backwards idea ultimately of if you could link to products by a subjected attributes and then you could build a feature around it that allowed customers to vote on these things and then it would be kind of ...

Ian McAllister (00:48:50):
So in spirit, it really wasn't working backwards. But the team was all excited and so we eventually wrote the press release and we did it. And it turned out, it wasn't successful. We ended up shutting it down later. And so I learned a lot, this was the first year or two at Amazon, about using the working backwards process but not really working backwards. And so that's literally, if I'm reviewing a working backwards press release or fact, or even talking with someone about a new initiative, my brain is wired now to not be able to process any information until I focus on the problem and the customer. And then once we start talking about that, then I can engage and literally work backwards to say, okay, how do we solve that problem? And what's the most elegant way to solve it? Or if there's three problems, what's number one or two or three? So it's probably a gap in me that I can't process information without working backwards from the problem, but I find it to be helpful when people do that.

Lenny (00:49:47):
So when people talk about working backwards, the way you're describing it is interesting where it's focused on start with the problem, which I think generally product teams try to do. Their one pagers their PRDs often have, here's the problem we're solving, here's why it's a problem, here's how we think about ... Is that the core of working backwards? I always imagined it was the launch release and the PR thing and maybe the FAQ. Working backwards at Uber and other and Airbnb, do you actually do that for every project yourself at this point?

Ian McAllister (00:50:17):
There's two parts of it. One, there's the concept of working backwards from what you're trying to accomplish. And I still absolutely do that with my teams as well. What are we trying to accomplish for the business or accomplish for a customer and let's start there. And if they have a problem that is interfering with their ability to be profitable for their ability, if it's a business customer or it's a customer trying to accomplish a goal, starting with that problem. That's different from the working backwards mechanism, which is the press release and the FAQ, which was the mechanism that Amazon used to enforce working backwards, which I think is effective. And I've tried to teach that and write some posts about with templates and things like that because it's a great way to start of the press release has a paragraph about the problem. That's what you write.

Ian McAllister (00:51:00):
And then you write the solution paragraph and then the customer quote. And then the fact which is is there a legitimate plan to succeed? So if you don't have that muscle to work backwards already and your team, it's a great thing to try, but that's not the only mechanism that can do it. And eventually if you do it enough and you build that muscle to work backwards, you can do it in any number of formats, whether it's something in a PRD or some other way. But the key is that you don't think what we could build, you think about the problem and then the solution that solves that problem.

Lenny (00:51:35):
Got it. Okay. So the press release is not core to it. It's like a trick to get you to think about the problem you're solving. It's not how you plant announce it.

Ian McAllister (00:51:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:51:43):
Interesting. I never thought about it that way. So when you're doing this process at other places outside Amazon, say you're a product leader that's trying to ... I want to improve the way we think about product. What is it that you suggest they do specifically? Is it write out, here's the problem we're solving? Is there more to it? What would you suggest there?

Ian McAllister (00:52:02):
If it's a blank slate, truly, you could certainly use the working backwards process like Amazon does with the internal press release and then the fact and so forth. So that's fine. But a lot of companies have a different way they go about it. Some companies are very much, it's slide culture and presentations and so forth. And so as a product leader you could think about what you do with your team and what you do upwards or across. And so you may have the latitude to use any process with your team. And I've done that at some companies where using documents and if they're supportive of the team and they recognize the value of that, like, oh actually this is good and this is a great way to write things down on paper and to have better information content and richer discussion that oftentimes I think people will find that versus a slide with a couple bullets is not great. Then you can build that muscle.

Ian McAllister (00:52:54):
And I've found it's a great way to teach and use those to dive deeper into product. But depending on the organization you're at, that may not wash to train your senior leadership to use the process you want to use. And so then it might be a matter of finding the opportunities to try something and saying, "Are you open to doing something this way?" A review of a doc instead of a review of a whatever. So that's a little separate than just working backwards, but I think you just have to acknowledge the environment you're in. And also, unless the organization has a specific format to do this. If it does, you probably just need to use it. Different leaders process information, different ways. You may find one format's effective with your leader, but another one to educate a broader organization. But it's very company specific. So despite what I might want to do, I've just got to recognize that I have more leverage down with my team versus up or across.

# How to unlock your product leadership skills | Ken Norton, Ex-Google

## Transcript

Ken Norton (00:00:00):
Part of what I think is pretty exciting about product management is you are a leader from day one in product management. There's leadership all over the place, but that's your job. You're a leader. You don't have any formal authority, but you're a leader. You're expected to lead

Lenny (00:00:22):

(00:02:38):
Welcome to the podcast, Ken. I am so honored to have you here. You're such a legend of product managers and product management circles. Your writing has had so much influence on so many people, including myself. If nothing else, you've led to many donuts being purchased by tech companies over the years. So thanks for being here.

Ken Norton (00:02:58):
Thank you and thanks for having me. The feeling's mutual. Obviously a big fan of your work and all the things you've done for the community and this podcast, which has been fantastic. So humbled and excited to be here. Yes, I do think that I'm at least maybe partially responsible for at least a lot of consumption of donuts over these years.

Lenny (00:03:18):
Are you tired of people asking you about donuts?

Ken Norton (00:03:21):
I'll never get tired of it. Well, back when we met with people in person, people would bring me donuts, and I never got tired of it, nor did any of the people that I worked with who got to eat those donuts get tired of it. So, no, no, I'll never get tired of donuts.

Lenny (00:03:37):
Someone on Twitter asked what's a digital equivalent of bringing the donuts now that we're in a remote world. Do you have any advice on that?

Ken Norton (00:03:45):
That's a great question. I'm not even sure if the physical equivalent of donuts is donuts. I mean when I came up with that, I think it was really to be a metaphor around being a servant leader, bringing whatever needs to be done, filling the white space, filling the gaps, whatever needed to happen. So it doesn't always have to be donuts.

(00:04:07):
I did put that question out to some of the readers in my newsletter a while ago, maybe earlier in the pandemic, and got a lot of really interesting ideas. Maybe that was at a place where people had a little bit more patience for happy hours over Zoom and stuff like that. Maybe that patient set is worn out. The idea that I love the most was actual donuts. There was a PM who got DoorDash codes and found the best local donut place for each of the people on the team and basically sent them a code and said, "Click here and order the donuts to come to your house whenever you want them." So maybe at least partially the digital equivalent of donuts might be actual donuts.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Decentralized donuts.

Ken Norton (00:04:42):
Decentralized donuts, on the blockchain.

Lenny (00:04:46):
Oh boy, let's not go there.

Ken Norton (00:04:48):
I don't know what that is.

Lenny (00:04:50):
So I was perusing your career path ahead of this chat. You had this pretty wild career. You were an engineer initially, and then you were CTO at a part of NBC. Then you're a founder. Then you spent 14 years at Google working on products that folks may have heard of, like Google Docs and Google Calendar and Google Maps. You've also done a bunch of writing. Then more recently, you've become a full-time executive coach focusing on product people.

(00:05:17):
I have so many questions I'd love to ask you about your career and learnings along the way, and the writing. But I'd actually like to spend most of our time talking about the coaching and things that you've learned through that experience. And so, I have a couple questions just off the bat. What does an executive coach actually do? What kinds of things are you helping people with? What does a session look like? Then, two, just how did you decide you wanted to be a coach full time after leaving Google?

Ken Norton (00:05:40):
Yeah, that's a great question. I think coaching does mean a lot of different things. I mean it depends on who you talk to. It is a little bit of who you are, your style, your approach. Some people are calling themselves coaches, doing more mentoring, more advice. Other people are maybe more like me, more peer coaching.

(00:06:01):
To me, I see executive coaching as a partnership or creative partnership. It's all about helping my client reach their goals, their potential, whatever that means to them. So an important thing about coaching is the definition of success does belong to the client. I don't have an agenda. I don't have a set of things I'm trying to share, teach, learn. It really is fundamentally up to them, which means every client is completely different. They have different sense of where they want to go. Different barriers that might be standing in their way.

(00:06:35):
My coaching practice, I coach the whole person. So there is no restriction on what we might talk on, what we might work on together. It's not limited to product. It's not even limited to work or even leadership. It's wherever they want to go, whatever change, transformation means to them.

(00:06:52):
As coaches, we bring a bunch of tools to the conversation. The most important ones, honestly, are probably listening and curiosity, intuition, open-mindedness, really there to help challenge them to see things in different ways, help them tap into their imagination, figure out when there might be underlying beliefs, help them connect dots that need to be connected, help them disconnect things that feel connected. There's a lot of exploration to it.

(00:07:20):
It's very jazz-like. My love of jazz has been shared before, but there is an improvisation to it. What coaching is really powerful is you may not necessarily know where you're going when you start and you follow wherever there is meaning and change for that individual, wherever is they want to go.

(00:07:38):
The question around what brought me into it was actually interesting. I, honestly working with my own executive coach, started to figure out what it is that mattered to me, what I liked, what my values were, what my purpose was, started to unpack that I love deeply connecting with people and I love helping people change and grow.

(00:08:01):
The moments when I had the opportunity to do that as a manager, as a product leader were the most fulfilling parts of my career. And so, I started to unpack that and figure out what would it look like if that was what I did.

(00:08:15):
The other part of the journey was, for several years at Google, I worked at GV. It's Google Ventures, Google's venture capital arm. I had the opportunity to work with founders and product leaders in the portfolio. I started to simultaneously recognize the shortcomings of giving advice, because it seemed like, well, I can meet with these folks, I could tell them what I did, I could tell them what Google did, and that'll answer all their questions.

(00:08:41):
You start to realize advice is not as powerful as you might think it is. It's a little bit like cotton candy. Doesn't have a lot of nutrition. You get a nice sugar high. You feel great, both sides feel happy, but then a couple weeks later, a couple months later, nothing's really changed.

(00:08:57):
That's because it doesn't often confront the real problem. It often isn't relevant. Like what worked for us at Google may not have worked anywhere else. It may not even have worked at Google for all I know. I feel like there were years at Google where all we were doing was making things worse by showing up and we should just all have gone sat on a beach somewhere, and the company would've grown even faster. So who knows?

(00:09:20):
I mean so it was these just twin pillars of wanting to figure out where I could do what I like the most, and then also recognizing that where growth comes from is less around advice and telling people what to do and more about helping them figure out their own path, their own way. Then that ultimately you brought me into, hey, I want to do this full time, and that's what I've been doing ever since.

Lenny (00:09:46):
When do you find people come to you to get advice and coaching? What kind of clients do you find you end up working with?

Ken Norton (00:09:53):
That's a great question. Generally speaking, I work with senior product leaders, however you want to define that. Typically, these are chief product officers, VPs of product at startups, largely director level and above at bigger tech companies, some CEOs, other C-level execs in there. I think really anyone that considers themselves in a product leadership role.

(00:10:15):
Often they come to me because there's a career milestone or a crossroads, and it could be that they now find themselves in the position of being a CPO for the first time. Maybe there's a new industry change, or they've gone from a big company to a startup and a have this sense of what got me here isn't going to get me there. That's oftentimes when they reach out for coaching.

(00:10:41):
I think my clients are also very introspective and surrounded by great mentors and advisors and have all sorts of people in their life who can help them, but are realizing that a lot of the work is going to be internal work that's going to get them to the next level. And so, this transformation is going to be just as much what I need to do as who I am. That's often when people come to me.

Lenny (00:11:08):
You said that the way you coach is about the whole person. I'm curious ... I don't know if there's an answer to this, but when people come to get help and coaching, how much of their blocks, I guess, are rooted in their regular life versus skills, technical skills, and more like the PME, product leadership side, if that makes sense?

Ken Norton (00:11:31):
Yeah, I think ... Well, let me maybe try to illustrate this with an example from my life right now. Indulge me, I'm going to go a little bit left field here, but I promise [inaudible 00:11:45].

Lenny (00:11:45):
Let's do it.

Ken Norton (00:11:46):
So we are teaching our 16-year-old son how to drive. So he just got his driver's permit. Do you remember when you learned how to drive, Lenny?

Lenny (00:11:56):
I do. Yup.

Ken Norton (00:11:58):
Yeah. Yeah. So it's scary. I don't know if you know how your parents might have felt, but-

Lenny (00:12:04):
Nope, [inaudible 00:12:06].

Ken Norton (00:12:06):
... [inaudible 00:12:06] on the other side of it. It's a whole new journey. Look, he's a smart kid. He's going to do great. But it helped me actually think back to when I learned how to drive. Actually, what I think is maybe a little bit more important here is before you learn to drive. And so, if you think about it as a ... When you're a kid, cars just go places. You get strapped in and you just wait and you get impatient. Then eventually you go somewhere. You're not even consciously aware of the concept of driving. Just cars just happen and you're not even aware of it.

(00:12:41):
As you get a little bit older, you start to become curious. You start to figure out, oh, that wheel has something to do with it. You turn the wheel. Maybe you start to understand there's pedals. But it also just seems really simple. Just like you get in the car and you drive it and you go somewhere. Maybe as you get older, you end up maybe even being a little bit of a smart Alec about how easy it looks and you start talking to your parents about, like, "It doesn't look hard. I can do this."

(00:13:07):
Now suddenly you're behind the wheel of the car. This is what my son is doing. Wow. Is it different than you thought it was going to be? Is it way more complicated? You have to remember check your mirrors. You've got to look before you turn. You didn't even know what that sign meant. You didn't know what those stripes meant. It is just overloading with complication and your internal mindset for confronting this challenge is not going to suit you the way you used to approach the world.

(00:13:44):
Maybe to put it in product leadership, product terms, everyone around you has got some real pithy advice about the things you're forgetting to do. It's like, "Hey, don't forget to check your mirror." Everyone's got a framework. It's like, "Ah, do you know about the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Wait, what's the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Oh, you just put your left hand on the 10:00, your right hand on the 2:00. That's the only thing you're missing. Here's a great medium post about that." Then you're like, "This is a problem is I have not adapted to the complexity of the world around me."

(00:14:19):
And so, there is this sense that what is interesting about driving is the world hasn't gotten any more complex. Driving's always been driving. But now your place in the world has shifted such that the internal meaning-making and self-complexity that is required requires a complete reboot of the internal operating system in order to allow you to thrive there.

(00:14:41):
And so, when you talk about this question of how much of this is skills, how much of this is tactics, how much of this is learning versus how much is internal growth, the answer is it's both, but the shift that is required is very much around how your inner self can make meaning and respond to the demands of the world around you so that you can succeed and thrive in this mindset shift that happens.

(00:15:09):
The skills matter, but by this point, you're beyond the place where you've learned the skills. There's mastering the skills, but there is this sense of what developmental psychologists call self-complexity, the ability to respond and adapt to that.

(00:15:24):
And so, I think we go through a lot of those shifts in our career. The driving example is simple. Actually, probably too simple, because the world is actually getting more complex for those of us that work in product. I mean every day something changes. It forces us to respond and adapt. So there aren't even rules of the road in product.

(00:15:42):
But I think this is what we're talking about, this question of the internal operating system I develop my ability to restructure it such that I can succeed given the demands that have been placed upon me.

Lenny (00:15:57):
What an amazing analogy. Totally hits home in a good and bad way. It's a really good segue to something I wanted to chat about, something that we talked about before the recording, which is what you're finding to be one of the bigger unlocks for your clients. It's also a concept that you've been spending a lot of time refining and you're finding is helping people shift, and specifically shift their leadership mindset. And so, I'd love to just hear you talk through your thinking there.

Ken Norton (00:16:24):
Yeah, it does sort lead into this. Maybe another analogy that might work for your listeners, if you think about product management, your career arc and where you are challenged from a mindset perspective, in some ways it does feel like the early part of your career. You're learning to play a video game. Hopefully there's a tutorial. Your first job is learning the ropes, somebody's teaching you. You maybe have managers that are giving you simple little missions that you can succeed at and if you fail, the consequences aren't bad.

(00:17:03):
It does feel like a little bit ... And I felt this way, and I talked to a lot of people earlier in their career. It does feel like you're trying to learn the rules of the game, trying to figure out the physics. You want to run up the score.

(00:17:15):
You get better at playing the game. You fail, but you start to develop some confidence that when you fail, you'll learn from it. You'll get better. You get really good at the game. You get promoted, you get rewarded, you unlock new levels, teach other people how to play the game. You start to feel really awesome about yourself.

(00:17:32):
But then suddenly you're put in a place where you realize that the rules of the game aren't so black and white. Maybe there's a long delay now between when you get to see what you did and the score of it. Things start to behave in unexpected ways. The physics start to get weird. You're on a level where you're floating. I don't know what the right metaphor is here.

(00:17:52):
But you start to recognize that there's been this huge change. The most frightening part about it is you look around and everyone is looking at you like you're the designer of the game, and you thought you were playing. That's often what it feels like when you move into a leadership role, to come back to this sense of what got me here is not going to get me there.

(00:18:17):
I work with a lot of leaders and sometimes that's come with a pretty significant cost, this juxtaposition, maybe your happiness, your health, your marriage. There's been this existential crisis of I don't know if I love this anymore. Maybe it leads to burnout. Maybe it's not even that dire. It's just a sense of, well, I'm looking around and I need to be something. I need to unlock something else to continue on this path. There is a sense of stuckness that comes from that.

(00:18:45):
What I've come to realize is this is the precipice of, I think, this pretty fundamental concept in leadership. I'm not the originator of this, so this has come up again and again and again. It's not new. It's going to sound familiar. It's like the flood myth from Gilgamesh showing up in all this oral histories of the world. It's not new.

(00:19:10):
Conscious Leadership Group, an organization that I'm big fan of, they call it above the line versus below the line. Brene Brown calls it daring versus armored leadership, sage versus warrior. Even in the world of sports, there's playing to win versus playing not to lose. It's this concept that's come up again and again. Leadership Circle calls it creative versus reactive, and that's the term I'm going to use. I like that.

(00:19:35):
Here's the distinction. Very simple. Are you responding to the world from a place of fear, where you see problems and threats, you want to be right, you want to be liked, you're defensive as an inward approach, or are you responding to the world from a place of openness, possibility, curiosity, passion, growth, purpose? Very simple concept. Pretty much everyone understands what I mean. It makes sense.

(00:20:11):
Everyone also then immediately says a couple of different things. "That sounds amazing. I'd rather have that," or, "Here are moments when I've felt that," but that's usually followed up by a couple of questions. "I don't know if that works. It doesn't sound very effective. Is it possible?" Then how do you that?

(00:20:38):
The effective part is actually a question we can answer, which is, yes, it is more effective. Bob Anderson, Bill Adams are two management scientists who've written extensively, done a whole bunch of research, and they have looked at every possible dimension you can imagine of success, both leadership capability, they've looked at revenue, brand, profitability, everything, and it's shown, yes, this creative form of leadership is in every possible way positively correlated with success and reactive leadership is negatively correlated. So, yes, it works yet.

(00:21:17):
Yet, according to their research, some 75% of leaders are primarily operating reactively. So most leaders are operating from a place of fear, reacting, seeing problems, and threats. That's because that other question of how do you do it is such a hard one to answer. It's not an easy thing that you flip the switch of. It goes back to this notion of redesigning that internal operating system, so how you confront the world, what underlying belief systems and assumptions you have that are causing you to operate from that place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
Can I ask you a quick question? Just to clarify the two sides, what's a sign that you're in the reactive side of things? I think one thing you said is you're worrying a lot about how people think about you and make sure that they like you. Is there anything else that's going to tell a listener, "Oh, maybe I'm falling into this trap"?

Ken Norton (00:22:13):
Yeah, you've nailed it, which is that fear, like operating from a place of anxiety. There are different ways, depending on our mindsets, our approaches. I like the word postures because it seems to click different ways that we retreat into this reactive mode. Fear and anxiety is the way. That's how you know. You're just like, "Ugh, I'm below the line." I'm just like I'm seeing problems. I'm seeing threats.

(00:22:43):
Our brains are hardwired to do that, so it's not like that's wrong. These are brains that learn to do that, I don't know, on the tundra being chased by wild animals. So this is our normal way of being. There might be different desires and needs that force you to operate that way. We think there's really three of these postures.

(00:23:11):
Anybody is probably more than one of them, so this is not pathologizing. This isn't putting you in a box. But probably one of these will resonate more than the others. Wanting to be approved, wanting to be loved, wanting other people to like you. This was me in my early part of my career.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Same.

Ken Norton (00:23:29):
Yeah. So you're kind of like the heart type. It's sometimes called move toward other people. A lot of that came from my environment. I was coming up with product management. No one necessarily knew what the job even was. I had no authority and most people could just ignore me if they wanted to. And so, I had to meet other people's expectations, please them, want to be accepted by them, seek their approval. It was this what we call a complying approach.

(00:23:58):
Here, this is why this is so vexing is it actually worked really well. It was pretty effective. Other people liked working with me. I listened to them and I considered everyone's needs and made sure everyone felt heard. But there came a point where I gave away so much power that it was hurting me when it came to purpose and execution and decisiveness.

(00:24:22):
And so, again, these aren't bad. There's usually underlying tendencies that are very good. It just starts to have a cost as you become more senior. It's like the gears start to grind to a halt a little bit.

(00:24:35):
Another way is more of a needing to be right head type, protecting one's own ideas, sometimes called a move away from type, distance, arrogance, criticism, retreating into your own ideas and head. Then the other will not be a surprise, is the more controlling, my way or the highway, autocratic will move against wanting to win, wanting to be number one, wanting to excel, wanting dominance, wanting control, this would be another tendency.

(00:25:10):
Often one of those feels natural to you and another one feels just so incredibly distasteful that you can't imagine possibly operating that way. This goes into the underlying beliefs part. If you had told me early in my career, when you saw me being passive and people-pleasing like that, "You've just got to stop caring what other people think, Ken. You've got to be more pushy."

(00:25:41):
People did say that to me. That was pretty common probably in my performance review. It was very common. Even people who worked for me were like, "You need to push back." My only archetype for doing that was the autocratic, controlling type. I was like, "I don't want to be like that. That guy's a jerk. That's a fascist. I don't want to be a fascist. I do care about other people."

(00:26:04):
And so, many of our examples and archetypes are these equally ineffective reactive ways of being. And so, no wonder I didn't want to be like that, because that's also not very effective either. But there was a sense for me of redefining ... This is where coaching is powerful is this what are the underlying assumptions and beliefs that you have that are causing you to fall back on some of these fundamental ways of operating and not let go of them?

(00:26:35):
Because the answer for me wasn't stop caring about other people. I wasn't going to do that. That's a value of mine. It's part of who I am. But take the caring about other people, the empathy, the connection, and direct it in a more creative way where you're operating now from a place of purpose and vision and not reacting and protecting and defending and wanting to be.

(00:26:56):
For me, the key to that was letting go of needing to be liked and redefining it as an admiration that takes place over time. So rather than I want to leave this room with everyone liking me, I started to realize I want to be the type of leader where, a decade later, people say, "I would work with that guy again in a heartbeat." That was part of the unlock for me.

(00:27:25):
Again, I care about other people. That's a natural gift that underlines it. But it's a redefinition of how that serves me, if that makes sense.

Lenny (00:27:34):
Say someone's in that first bucket ... And I was definitely in that first bucket. I still want people to like me and I still probably have flaws there. But say you're a PM and you're like, "Oh, man. That's exactly how I am acting right now." It sounds like is the core of it just a mindset shift, going from I need people to like me to what you just talked about of, okay, I'm going to shift to I just want them to respect me over time? Is that the core of it? I know it's probably not that easy, but how should someone behave during that bucket right now?

Ken Norton (00:28:03):
Yeah. It sounds easy, right? This is part of what's hard about this, is it always sounds easy when you describe it, having gone through the journey. It's sort of like talk to somebody on the summit of Mount Everest and they'll be like, "Yeah. Well, I could just climb this mountain. That's how I got here." You're like, "Okay, wait, that's not that easy." Again, it is very individualized.

(00:28:21):
I think there's an appreciation that you have to understand what is holding you back. This is a lot of the work that I'll do with my clients is what is those underlying expectations? What are these underlying beliefs?

(00:28:40):
I Believe that my style was incompatible with being the leader. I would've said I can't be a CEO because I'm not tough enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not commanding enough. I can't command a room. It's like, okay, what is the underlying belief I'm making about what leadership is there? There's an archetype that I have in my mind that is incompatible with this this way.

(00:29:10):
And so, there's a need to confront that. Okay, what makes you believe the only type of leader is the leader that orders people around? Maybe that's all I've ever seen. Maybe I don't believe it's possible to be another type of leader. Maybe there's an inner critic that is convincing me that that's not who I am, because a part of it is redefinition of what does leadership need for you, for you authentically? What would it be like, in my case, to lead with purpose and be decisive and lead with vision and to have other people felt like they're being brought along and listened to and participated and create safe spaces for other people? That was the question there.

(00:29:47):
It took people challenging my point of view. It took working with a coach, asking me questions, forcing me to see places I'd made connections, that the connections don't really need to be made. There's a lot of instruments and tools we work with in coaching. There's 360-degree assessments that are very helpful here that will start to help you understand, hey, here are places where you're operating actively. Here are places where you're operating really creatively, because, by the way, most people are partially somewhere in that journey. It's a developmental process.

(00:30:17):
And to start to be able to get the feedback, the dopamine hit of seeing when I do it this way, actually it's more effective and it doesn't cost me as much. I'm happier and I'm enjoying it, I'm seeing that it's working, is oftentimes a big part of this because there is this belief that it won't work. The number of times when I'm with a client in coaching and say, "Well, what if you did do that?" and they go, "It just won't work." You realize that there is this wiring in there that needs ... And this is what I talk about, this operating system that needs to be rejiggered to start to make sense of what if it did and how might you know.

Lenny (00:30:55):
The point you just made about how you can realize that you can be successful in a lot of different ways and you don't have to be this one archetype of a leader really resonates with my experience. I actually had an executive coach for a few months, and that was probably the biggest unlock for me. We did the strengths exercise, which a lot of people do. The main thing that she helped me see is you can do all the things that you want to do through the lens of the strengths that you have and not have to force yourself to be good at these other things, because there's many ways to accomplish the same outcomes.

Ken Norton (00:31:29):
That's exactly right. Then once you start to understand that, you start to develop a better way of finding the right place, the right environment, the right role. When we began the conversation, you asked me what brought me into executive coaching. I would feel these ... I would describe it as flying too close to the sun in my career, where I would have a team. I'd be managing a small team. I would love it. I would enjoy it. Then suddenly my team would grow.

(00:31:57):
I'd become more senior than I felt comfortable being. Then I felt like I wasn't getting to do the "real" work anymore. Then I would be just completely disheveled and dissatisfied. Then I'd go try to go find a smaller team or even stop being a manager. It was a very meandering, reactive path. It was like every so often I was catching a wave, and I knew what it felt like to be on the wave, but I didn't know what the characteristics of the wave were.

(00:32:23):
Then through coaching, I was like I love connecting with other people. I like helping people grow. I like helping challenge people. I like helping. Then I was like what are those parts? What if I unpack those? Oh, that's why I loved managing that team of five because I got to do a lot of it. That's why I hated managing a team of 35 because there's no time for it.

(00:32:44):
Then you start to say, okay, well, what if rather than just randomly meandering through my career, I actually elevated needing to connect, wanting to be helpful? Then you're like what would it be like if I wanted the helping professions? It's just a reframing of move through your career in a way that seems externally to fit some definition of success and to start to define that internally.

(00:33:11):
That is the very definition of the reactive versus creative mindset. Reactive, allowing the world to set the expectations and try to meet them versus tap into what your real, true sense of purpose and vision is. Then use that to navigate the world.

Lenny (00:33:28):
It's interesting that so much of this is just mindset. It's not like learning a new skill as a leader or a product manager. It's just seeing yourself in the world differently. All of a sudden you unlock your career. Is that what you find?

Ken Norton (00:33:40):
Absolutely. That's why I think so much of the focus on the skills, the frameworks, it can be limited as you develop these capabilities, because it's inner work. Where we're talking about is this is all me.

(00:33:57):
Now that's empowering. There's empowerment to be able to say I want to change something and it doesn't involve a whole bunch of other people convincing and persuading them, getting into an executive ... This is all me. But it also, in some ways, makes it harder because it is all you. In coaching, it's all about you. It's all about that. Who am I and what matters to me? What underlying belief systems, inner voices are challenging me in ways that I want to be challenged? What is my unique ...

(00:34:31):
I love the word authenticity. It's, like you were just talking about, like what is my authentic way to lead, and then how do I center that rather than trying to fit into someone else's definition of what leadership might be?

(00:34:43):
You may recognize I can't be that authentic way of leader at this place or in this place type of company, but I know how to find it and I'm going to go find it.

Lenny (00:34:55):
Do you have any more examples of either someone uncovering this about themselves, or another mindset shift that you can make in one of these other buckets, similar to the idea of I'll think about people over the long term versus immediately?

Ken Norton (00:35:10):
Yeah. It really does vary. You start to pick up on that shift when it's less of the goals being defined externally and more of the goals being defined internally. So you'll have a conversation with somebody who's new to coaching and you'll say, "What do you want?" They'll be like, "Well, I want to get promoted to VP." "Why?" "Because I want to be a VP." It's like, "Well, what's important about being VP?" "Well, because ... " Eventually the answer is, well, because it's there and that's the thing that I'm supposed to do.

# Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)

## Transcript

Maggie Crowley (00:00:00):
If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:00:57):

(00:04:06):
Maggie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Maggie Crowley (00:04:10):
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:04:12):
You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets, I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. And I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked with a bunch of PMs, you've hired a lot of PMs, you've managed a lot of PMs, and so I guess the question is just what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?

Maggie Crowley (00:04:50):
Yeah, it's an interesting question mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.

(00:05:31):
First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.

Lenny (00:06:15):
I think that's a really interesting point, because it sounds simple. Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.

Maggie Crowley (00:06:33):
Prioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. And I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.

(00:07:13):
Because I think a lot of when we talk about product, it's like, oh, what should you build? What should you ship? But then you actually have to ship that and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, a year. And so as a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again, and the best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and the energy to stay with it.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Energy. That's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So, either we can go into how you found you get better at simplifying or we go through all three and then we can come back, however you prefer.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:51):
Let's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.

Lenny (00:07:54):
Sounds great.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:55):
So, yeah, first one, simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one pager or something will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move. Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today, that gets you some extra points, but the really, really good PMs remember to follow up. Because especially when you're in management, couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature, but if a PM comes back to me and says, "Hey, remember we did that thing, here's what happened." I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that and for the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs and it's easy.

(00:08:43):
It's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's really high value activity. And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is that a phrase actually we were talking about David Cancel before we started carrying the water, and this was a big theme when I joined Drift, and this is about how you can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard boring unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing, copy, project management, you have to do that stuff. It's your job. No one else is going to do it, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So, you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.

Lenny (00:09:33):
It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally what people think about.

Maggie Crowley (00:09:50):
Those things to me, communication, super important, analytical ability, really, really important. The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work and build up intuition around that, also really important. Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role. These are the things that make you great at the role and strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit. It's one tiny slice. You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy and you need to pick the right products, but at the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps and has the ability to actually create impact. So, to me, you could be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.

Lenny (00:10:48):
And impact is the other one. Everyone's always like, what makes a great PM? Oh, drive a lot of impact. And again-

Maggie Crowley (00:10:52):
But they never say how.

Lenny (00:10:54):
Right, exactly.

Maggie Crowley (00:10:54):
It's like, cool, let's do a strategy, let's have impact. Then when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact. And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what? Yeah, impact. Let's do it. Where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.

Lenny (00:11:14):
I love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three and I'm curious just what you found helps you become better at these things and also just an example if you can share. So, say what's simplifying? How does one build that muscle?

Maggie Crowley (00:11:27):
This is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like are they a simplifier or are they complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated, it doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, check it out, can you read it?

(00:12:10):
I read it and then I put it down and I say, "What are you trying to say?" And 99% of the time they say, "Oh, users are really struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the way to solve it's to do X", but that's not what the document says. And so my reaction is always, and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to this, they're going to laugh is always, "Just say that. Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write." There's no reason why your pros in a document has to be a certain way. We're not in school. Our goal is to get things done. So, those are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I've already been working on.

(00:12:54):
And as for how to boil things down and really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many reps in as you can, have people review your work and listen to them. There's a thing that happens I think with PMs where you join a company and then all of a sudden it's like my boss doesn't know what they're doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop in and mess everything up, but those people had an insight on the market that you're in that made the company worth founding and they probably know more than you and so you might want to listen to them. And so find people who can review your work, listen to them and ask them to help you simplify.

Lenny (00:13:39):
I'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you were talking, because this is a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it again and again and honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to simplify in my writing and strategy docs one-pagers and things like that, and I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is learning just to strip down as much as you can and anything that isn't necessary. So, there's a couple things that I'll share real quick. One is there's this book I read called On Writing Well, that is one of the most impactful books for writing for me, and the whole book is like, I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should cut from your writing and they show all these examples of like, here's a before and here's an after.

(00:14:18):
And all these words were cut and nothing changed. They're completely necessary. So, I think that book can help and partly it's just like what is not necessary? You think all these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is the rule of thirds, I guess the rule of three, of just always having three. Try not to go beyond three when you're giving strategy bets or priorities or things like that. Just try to keep things under three.

Maggie Crowley (00:14:44):
Yeah, it's a very sort of business school ex-consultant point of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice round couple and if you have a fourth, you've got to figure out how to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's four.

Lenny (00:15:02):
Agree. Yeah, even though I've been guilty of more than three, try hard to avoid it.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:07):
Yeah, you're using notion and you have your three bullets expanding and there's sub bullets, but at least you have that top line.

Lenny (00:15:13):
That's right. The other thing is I think that there's just a focus you need to get good at just like, people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do that it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's just a lot of power and pick the thing, pick the thing that's going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have some impact but is much less important.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:31):
I think again, simplification is something and prioritization, which is sort of the same thing, gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at, but it's really challenging. Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things, you'll never be successful if you do that in a number of things. And so you have to pick one.

(00:15:59):
And so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then B, having the willingness, and maybe I should have added this to my what makes great PMs list, the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. And that's what I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right.

Lenny (00:16:32):
Ownership such an important part of just being a PM. Again, coming back to this interview I just did with an ex Amazon guy, that's one of their principles at Amazon is just leaders, basically ownership, feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on.

Maggie Crowley (00:16:46):
I agree, but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same oh shit feeling as you're making a bet. You make a bet, that means you know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going to work out and you still have to be the one to do the thing, jump off the ledge, drop in on the ski run. So, ownership to me never signaled that risk that I think comes with being a PM.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Good point. On the simplify concept, it reminds me at Airbnb, one of the core values at Airbnb for time was simplify. Is this idea that we should always try to be simplifying, and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it. So, they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't have aspirational values, we should reflect who we actually are, and they actually cut two different values to be more clear, even though they still want to simplify, they're just like, we're not actually good at this, so why are we pretending like we are.

Maggie Crowley (00:17:45):
I think maybe I'm good at it on paper, but there's been many times where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep fighting for it.

Lenny (00:17:54):
Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to become better as a PM and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reduce your email length? Is it one pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind

Maggie Crowley (00:18:12):
On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second.

Lenny (00:18:36):
I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people that I will link in the show notes that gives you-

Maggie Crowley (00:18:41):
Fantastic.

Lenny (00:18:42):
The Minto Pyramid principle.

Maggie Crowley (00:18:42):
Yes, everyone should do that. A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is, everyone will thank you. Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them. My dad, again, to go back to my dad when I would write, and this sounds cruel, but I promise it wasn't. When I would write a paper for school, he would just, and this is we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. He would go, "Everything on the first page is crapola, don't use it."

(00:19:30):
And he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just like, "Oh, it's crap. I don't care about that." So, I would do that and then just get other people, there's probably somebody around you that's good and find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it, me and two other women who are product leaders, and we oftentimes send each other our work still and we say, "Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?" And we do that for each other. So, find a peer maybe who's in a non-competitive space who can do that for you. I mean I still use those people to help me.

Lenny (00:20:10):
That is extremely cool. Can you talk more about this group that you have?

Maggie Crowley (00:20:15):
Yeah, I don't know if it's a group. It's like three friends. Shout out Alexa and Daphne. Yeah, I mean the three of us all worked together when we were at Drift. We've stayed in touch and I've just found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback, and the more senior you get, the harder that is. And so having people who can give you another point of view who maybe you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader who can give you other experiences that they're going through has been incredibly valuable. And so we just have a little group chat that is focused on product.

Lenny (00:20:49):
That is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone that wants to create something like this? Is it important for you to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip.

Maggie Crowley (00:21:00):
Slack just worked for us where we are during the day, and I think having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a literal group text. There are small community, there's one, I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit, and there's a Slack community that somebody organized for heads of products and healthcare startups that is similar to those really, really powerful and a really great space to be in. And so you just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people and there's people around you who are going to become your friends, and so keep an eye out for them and keep in touch with them when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little Slack workspace.

Lenny (00:21:39):
Oh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described as following up on results, is it just do that. Is there anything more you can add there?

Maggie Crowley (00:21:49):
I put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But if you're launching a product, usually you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and you're maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it, then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing, and you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that.

Lenny (00:22:20):
And is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs, that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything, or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact or is it both?

Maggie Crowley (00:22:36):
It's definitely both. I'm not going to pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're going to get what you want. Just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job getting results. If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I am of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't want to leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So, I would suggest doing it for both reasons. And that's one of those things that people want to pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always going to get what we want and always going to get that promotion, but you have to work for it.

Lenny (00:23:22):
I love that point. It reminds me what I find one of the most important traits of a great product manager is they create this aura that they've got this, they put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. And this connects to me there. They feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.

Maggie Crowley (00:23:45):
Yeah, that's a really good point. And then you mentioned this a little bit ago, the side benefit is that you learn more. You will go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen, and the more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is family shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.

Lenny (00:24:19):
There's a lot of people that are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM. They're not moving off the ladder like, oh my god, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience, it took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?

Maggie Crowley (00:24:40):
I would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. It was after business school and I left those two years thinking, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff, I'm good. Went to a startup, there was another product person there, they left and I was the only product person at the startup. And I realized really quickly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making. That's why I joined Drift is because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn.

(00:25:29):
And so then two more years. So, that's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. And that's because it takes a long time to ship stuff. And so to people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping, you can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me staying at that, when I was at Drip, I was there for almost four years. I got to see two or three cycles of the same product and I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions and that's rare. And people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted, of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious. Lots of people are ambitious, but for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful and I think allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or a product versus just bounce and track a bunch of different companies or depends?

Maggie Crowley (00:26:39):
It depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, many people have done it, but I was surprised at how much I value that experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because you don't hear that point of view as much or as I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the sort of arc of my career, but I'm glad that I did it. And then of course people always want to get promoted, always ask that question and my answer is always create impact and that can take time.

Lenny (00:27:16):
At my first job, I was there for nine years and then I started a company for a year and a half and then we sold to Airbnb, and then I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep and I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons. Okay. Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the water, I think is how you described it.

Maggie Crowley (00:27:42):
Yeah. This one, there's no tips and tricks. It's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.

(00:28:17):
Because we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going. And it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. And part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that, whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:28:55):
It reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared, in one of your podcast episodes. It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt it's your job as a PM, which I think relates very much to which it just shared. Can you speak to that?

Maggie Crowley (00:29:12):
It might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that are part of the team. So, as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this down and build the thing and make it work to spec. As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the user experience. Obviously there's lots more complexity in that role. Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TLDR, caveat, whatever. But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?

(00:29:41):
It's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one-pager. That's not true. Your job isn't just to pick the problem. Your job is to deliver a business result. And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one else is incentivized to do that. As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it, and the good ones care, but you don't have to care. As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for the customer or the user at the end of the day. And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.

Lenny (00:30:17):
It reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot of the PM job sucks. It's not as glamorous as people often think, and most of the job is these really boring, annoying things. I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just a lot of people want to get into PM, they're like, oh, I'm going to run the show. It's going to be so great. I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do. But that's not how it is.

Maggie Crowley (00:30:41):
It's just one of those things that people, and when I joined product, it was just sort of becoming a cool job. It wasn't the hot job on campus when I was in business school. That was more private equity, venture capital. And now there's a sense of cachet around it. But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do cool stuff. You get to decide what gets built. That's cool. You have a lot of ownership like we talked about. You could see it as you have a lot of power, but at the same time you're responsible.

(00:31:12):
And so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door. And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do. Again, project management is one everyone hates on. QA is a really good one. You should QA your products. That's great if you have a QA team, you should QA them. You should know how they work. You should implement with your customers, you should be able to sell them, you should be able to find users. All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do, and none of it is above you.

Lenny (00:31:42):
If someone is listening and they're not a PM and they are not convinced to not get into product manager, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for selling that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product management?

Maggie Crowley (00:31:55):
I thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack workspace team. Because it's been a long time since I've tried to get into product. And so I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard and I don't know if things have changed. I went to business school and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there, big tech companies, if you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. And so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who switched laterally within a company. Again, challenging but can be done. Or people who joined startups. So, when I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. And I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work.

(00:32:49):
The reason why people don't do it is because as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. And what we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. And I loved every second of it, and I wish I could do that again and again and again. But to get that, she basically just hounded me. Christina, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot. We talked a lot and we waited until the time was right and then you finally convinced me to do it. So, I don't know. I don't if there's a reliable path that I can say this is what my advice would be other than try a startup network. See what you can do.

Lenny (00:33:33):
And you've made up this point elsewhere, which I think is an additional key piece is once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I'm just like, I look at a resume like, oh, they've never been a PM. This isn't the role. It's rarely that someone wants someone that's never been a PM.

Maggie Crowley (00:33:51):
Yeah. And I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product. And that's one of the things I always tell them because if they're deciding between roles and they have an opportunity to do something, and my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it. Because to your point, it's what we screen on. It's for better or for worse, it's just like you have to get that first job. And then once you get that first job, it all gets easier. You can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then the second question I have is, what have you shipped? So, it's like, have you been at PM before? What have you shipped? And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question. And the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.

Lenny (00:34:36):
Let's shift topics and talk about product strategy. Many people are told you need to get better product strategy. You're not great at strategy. A lot of people are also just confused, what is strategy? How do I get better at strategy? How do we describe a strategy? And you have a really great explanation and overview of how to think about this stuff. So, I'd love to hear your take on just how do you actually write out and describe a strategy.

Maggie Crowley (00:35:04):
Sure, yeah. And another thing that happens, and I'll give the outline, but another thing I hear, especially as you get further in your career, and unfortunately if you're maybe an underrepresented person in tech, is that you need to be more strategic. And so that's feedback that almost always happens, especially if you're a woman in product, in tech who's knocking at the door of a leadership role. You've probably gotten that feedback. And so I made it my mission to figure out what the heck is this thing? How do I do it? How can I do it in a way that is demonstrable so that I'm never getting that feedback that's like, oh, she's not strategic. And so what I did was something that I kind of did in the background because I had an engineer who I worked with who really wanted to understand why we were doing what we were doing, and he was not satisfied with sort of a surface level answer.

(00:35:57):
And he was just pushing and pushing and pushing. And so what I did was I just wrote out a Google doc and I started with like, okay, and not fancy, these are just bullets. What is the mission? What is the point of the company? What are our goals? Maybe we have some sort of high level framing of what we're working on. And then I had this big section that was just the landscape. And in that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing. Just dump that all on paper. Then what are the current quarters business goals or however you do planning, what are the current things that your company's working on? Then I put in, all right, that's sort of the context that we're operating in.

(00:36:44):
Then I wanted to understand where are we. So what is an honest accounting of the current state of your product, the business overall, and then the specific area that you're working in. What works, what doesn't work? What are your customers saying? Bottoms up feedback, users, customers, teams, what are your support tickets? Get that all out on paper. And then really importantly, where are your technical hurdles? What are the big pieces of tech debt? What are your engineering and technical teams always harping on that they want to invest in? Are there some big things coming down the pipe that you need to think about? Just get everything on paper. And then usually in the process of writing all that down, you'll start to see, okay, I kind of get where we are. I kind of get what the challenge is. And then you write a section that's like, what's the opportunity?

(00:37:34):
From all of that, what's going to bubble up as the top one or two opportunities for your team? Where do you want to play? Where can you win? Where's the unique? Based on your unique competitive advantage, where do you think you all should be and why? And then based on that opportunity, what are the challenges? So, what's going to be the hardest about taking advantage of that? What has to be, another way to frame it is what has to be true about the world for that to work? That's a one that's been helpful. And then what would you do? Take a swing at writing down your solution, what you would need to build, how might it work? Anything that you have, this is where I would say three bullets, maybe what you might want to do and then a plan. If no one else had an opinion, how would you go about it?

(00:38:26):
How would you sequence it? What would you do? How might you get the team to work on it? What would your team have to look like? How much would it cost to do it? All that you can start to layer in all that kind of stuff. And then I just share the doc. Share it with everybody. There should not be any secret. And you should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there. And if anyone doesn't agree with it, they can call out where their disagreement lands in that landscape. But at least then you've put everything on paper, you understand how you got to where you're going, and then you can have an argument about the different pieces and points of data and feedback that you're getting, but at least people understand how you got where you got. And then it doesn't become like, I don't agree with you. It becomes, I don't agree with this point.

Lenny (00:39:18):
This is such a cool way of doing it. By the way, is there a template that we can point people to that has this sort of-

Maggie Crowley (00:39:23):
There's not, I've only ever done it in a loose Google doc and then it just grows and changes. I can maybe try to write up those bullets, but it's just like I just make headers and then I just start dumping content in it.

Lenny (00:39:36):
Yes, that's all people need. If you end up creating that before this comes out, we'll throw it in the show notes. And if not, people can just bother you on Twitter and ask Maggie, where's that template that we talked about?

Maggie Crowley (00:39:44):
Yeah, I'm happy to write it on a piece of paper and take a photo of it and send it around.

Lenny (00:39:49):
There you go. Just make it really grainy and an artifact. We found Maggie's template. This is awesome. So, I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape, and I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from you just don't have the same information or the manager, exec or whatever doesn't think you have the information. So, if you just lean into, here's everything that I know and here's what's happening, and if you disagree with this goal, tell me, and then it'll change the plan.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:40:18):
And yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:18):
Part of it's also that typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. So, I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy for example, you don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback, don't overcomplicate it, just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or doing it better than I'm doing it.

(00:41:11):
So, I was like, okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you run in with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and if people cared to engage with it was there.

Lenny (00:41:33):
So, along those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be depending either on the timescale, say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year, how many pages should this doc be as any guide?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:46):
It's long. It gets real long.

Lenny (00:41:48):
What is long?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:53):
The actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto principle. I end up doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that there's one, within the first, above the fold, if you will. You can kind of get the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be, should be customizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics, interesting technological changes that are happening. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies marketing websites and dumping that in there. And that might be some interesting comments. So, it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.

Lenny (00:42:37):
And you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory if they want to really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing everything and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like this is actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.

Maggie Crowley (00:42:58):
It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place. And that's for me. So, it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that my, especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the doc because they're pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.

(00:43:28):
And so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too. And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say, yeah, that looks great, or You're dumb, I hate this. And okay, sure. There's always those people. So, it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

# Strategies for becoming less distractible and improving focus | Nir Eyal

## Transcript

Nir Eyal (00:00:00):
I went to Alibaba and I bought myself one of these flip phones from China like we used to have in the 1990s with no apps, no internet connection. And then I got myself a word processor off of eBay so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff. And even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, "Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in," or, "Let me just clean off my desk real quick," or, "You know what? I should take out the trash." And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions.

(00:00:51):
It's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, "Wait a minute, it's just a feeling." It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.

Lenny (00:01:10):
Today, my guest is Nir Eyal. Nir is the author of two bestselling books, Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life. Nir spends his time teaching and consulting at the intersection of psychology, technology, and business. His books have sold over 1 million copies in over 30 languages. In our conversation, we get very tactical about how to become less distractable and how to get better at focusing on doing the work that you know need to do. Nir shares at least a dozen tools and tricks that you can put into place today to help you stay focused and avoid getting distracted. After this conversation, I've already implemented some of these tactics and they're actually working. If you find these helpful or you want to go deeper, definitely check out Nir's book Indistractable. With that, here is Nir Eyal after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:04:24):
Nir, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nir Eyal (00:04:27):
Thanks so much, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:29):
I feel like we have a chance to record the most valuable hour in podcast history because it could give people more time to do the things they want to do. And this is based on a book that you wrote. It's called Indistractable, which is all about helping people become less distracted, become better at focus, and it might be the most essential skill in the workplace today. And so, what I'm hoping to do today in our chat is just basically give people as many tactical skills and pieces of advice and tools to become less distractable and to get better at focus. How does that sound?

Nir Eyal (00:04:59):
That sounds great. I love that you're setting the expectations high. I'll try and meet them.

Lenny (00:05:03):
Well now, we got to hit them. Okay, so here's the question. I'll just start really broad and let's just see where this goes. My question is just how does one become less distractable, slash how do I become less distractable?

Nir Eyal (00:05:15):
Okay, so there's a deeper motivation here. It's like, "I need help," which is great. That's my favorite thing to do, is to actually get concrete with people about what their specific challenges are. But let me back up here. So, this is what I spent five years writing a book about, because why did it take me five years to write a book? Because I was so distracted. So, I wrote this book for me more than anyone else. That's the only reason I write books. It's not because of what I know, but because of what I want to know. And I discovered that there were so many myths and tropes and just flat out harmful things that I was doing to hurt my own productivity. And when I really went down to first principles and looked at the research, I found that there were so many things that I was doing wrong.

(00:05:56):
But since I've changed my ways and adopted what the research literature says about distraction, it's improved my life in inconceivable ways. I'm in the best shape of my life at 45 years old. I have a better relationship with my family than ever. I'm more productive at work than ever before, not because I didn't know what to do. That's what I find is really emblematic of people today is not that we don't know what to do. It used to be maybe, okay, our grandparents, they didn't know what to do because the information was scarce. They had to go to the library and look things up. Well, today, with the internet, we all basically know what to do. And if you don't know what to do, Google it. You can find the answer out there. But we all basically know common-sense stuff like if you want to get in shape, you have to exercise and eat right, okay?

(00:06:38):
You don't need a diet book to tell you that. If you want to have better relationships with your family, you have to be fully present with people. If you want to do better at work, you have to do the hard work that other people don't want to do. We already know these things. What we don't know is how to get out of our own way, how to stop getting distracted. And so, that was certainly my problem. And so, what I wanted to do was really dive into the problem because the conventional solutions didn't work for me. When I have a problem in my life, I'll think about it, I'll write about it, I'll talk to friends, I'll talk to my wife about it. If I still can't figure it out, I'll read books about it. And what the conventional wisdom out there written by a lot of college professors that are all tenured is stop using technology, stop checking email, get off social media. It's melting your brain, but that's not very helpful, right?

(00:07:23):
Maybe if you have tenure, that's okay, but I can't stop using technology. My career will plummet. I have to use these tools. So, I wanted much more practical advice, and what I discovered was that the root cause of distraction is much more interesting and the solution is far more empowering than stop using technology, technology's evil, it's melting your brain. So, where do we begin? Maybe the best place to start is by first, before we dive into the tactics around how do we become indistractable, the first place to start is what is distraction? Understanding the term really, really matters. And the best way to understand what distraction is, is to understand what distraction is not. What's the opposite of distraction? So, if you ask most people, what's the opposite of distraction?

(00:08:06):
They'll tell you focus, right? I don't want to be distracted, I want to be focused. That's not exactly right. Then in fact, the opposite of distraction is not focus. The opposite of distraction is traction. Becomes pretty easy when you look at both words, traction, distraction. They're opposites because both words come from the same Latin root, trahare, which means to pull, and they both end in the same six letters, A-C-T-I-O-N that spells action, reminding us that distraction is not something that happens to us. It is an action that we ourselves take. So, traction, by definition, is any action that pulls you towards what you say you were going to do, things you do with intent, things that move you closer to your values, and help you become the kind of person you want to become. Those are acts of traction. Now, the opposite of traction, distraction, is any action that pulls you away from what you plan to do, further away from your goals, further away from becoming the kind of person you want to become.

(00:09:01):
And what separates traction from distraction is one word, and that one word is intent. I love this Dorothy Parker. She said, "The time you plan to waste is not wasted time." So, I think we need to stop medicalizing and moralizing what people do with their time. Why is it that someone going on Reddit or on social media or watching a YouTube video that's somehow morally inferior to watching a football game on TV? It's not. Anything you want to do with your time and attention is fine as long as it's done with intent, as long as you're doing it on your schedule, and not someone else's, certainly not the tech company's schedule. So, anything you do with intent is traction, anything else is distraction. So, what I discovered, for me, was that I was getting tricked by distraction in that the most pernicious form of distraction I discovered was the kind I didn't even realize was distracting me.

(00:09:53):
So, let me know if this sounds familiar to you, Lenny. I would sit down at my desk. I would look at my to-do list. By the way, we can talk about why to-do lists are one of the worst things you can do for your personal productivity. We can get back to that later. But I would sit down at my desk and I'd say, "Okay, I've got that big important project. That's what I'm going to do this morning. I'm not going to get distracted, nothing's going to get in my way. Here I go, I'm going to get started, but first let me check some email."

Lenny (00:10:17):
Are you watching me because this happens to me every morning. You got to stop.

Nir Eyal (00:10:21):
This is totally autobiographical. This is what I used to do all the... "Oh, let me just scroll that Slack channel. What's everybody at the office doing? Oh, let me just catch up on industry news." That's important. That's part of my job. I'm being productive, right? And what I didn't realize is that distraction was tricking me into prioritizing the urgent and the easy stuff at the expense of the hard and important work I had to do to move my life and career forward. So, just because it's a work-related task, doesn't mean it's not a distraction. In fact, that's the worst kind of distraction. Far worse than playing Candy Crush or whatever because then you're putzing around, then at least it's obvious that you're distracted. But if you're just checking work email, you feel productive even though that's a distraction because it's not what you said you want to do with your time and attention. So now, we have this framework. We have traction, we have distraction.

(00:11:08):
Now, there's one more thing that's super important, then we'll have the entire picture so that we can stop thinking about the model and actually get to a brass tacks of what do we actually do. Now that we have traction distraction the other thing we have to consider are triggers. We have two kinds of triggers. We have external triggers. These are things in our outside environment, the usual suspects, the pings, the dings, the rings, all this stuff in our outside environment, which we tend to blame for distraction, but studies find, that's only 10% of the reason we get distracted, 10% of the time it's because of something outside of us. What's the other 90%? Turns out 90% of the time that we get distracted, it's not because of what's happening outside of us, but that most distraction begins from within boredom, loneliness, fatigue, uncertainty, anxiety. That is the cause of 90% of our distractions. So, whether it's too much news, too much booze, too much football, too much Facebook, you are always going to get distracted from one thing or another unless you understand the root cause of the problem.

(00:12:09):
So, step number one to becoming indistractable is to master those internal triggers or they will become your master. Now, we're working around those four points. Step number two, make time for traction. We can talk about that. Hack back the external triggers and step number four, prevent distraction with pacts. So, you asked a big question, I gave you a big answer. That's the overall framework. That's a strategy. Tactics are what you do. Strategy is why you do it. So, I wanted to explain the strategy before we got into the tactics.

Lenny (00:12:36):
Amazing. I love this word traction because it relates to kind of the other side of this podcast of growth, product market fit, building products people want, getting traction with users. So, I really like that there's this additional way of thinking about traction, which is basically not being distracted. Can you just repeat the four steps again for people to have this in mind?

Nir Eyal (00:12:55):
Step number one, master internal triggers. Step number two, make time for traction. So, this is where we're turning our values into time. We can talk about how to do that. Step number three is hack back the external triggers. This is where we get into the pings, dings, and rings, not just the obvious stuff like your phone, your computer. I take about a page and a half to talk about that. That's kind of kindergarten stuff. But what about all the non-obvious external triggers? What about stupid meetings that didn't need to be called? What about emails that didn't need to be sent and received? What about our kids? Our kids are wonderful. I know you're a new dad, they're fantastic to have kids, but they can also be a source of distraction. So, how do we deal with all those external triggers, and then finally prevent distraction with pacts and pacts are this firewall, this last resort against distraction that we can use to keep distraction at bay and it's really about these four steps in concert in this order that anyone can use to become indistractable.

Lenny (00:13:47):
Awesome. Does this spell something clever, by the way?

Nir Eyal (00:13:49):
No, I didn't have an acronym, but I do have a pretty picture.

Lenny (00:13:53):
Awesome. So, let's go through this and I'd love specifically example you shared, I think many people run into this. There's a hard thing I need to do and I'm just going to go check my email and Twitter instead. I feel like that's a very common distraction, and so sharing, getting into that at some point would be awesome, but otherwise let's get into these four steps.

Nir Eyal (00:14:09):
Yeah, well, we can absolutely do that. So, is that something you encounter? It sounds like a...

Lenny (00:14:13):
100%. Every time. I have my to-do list, work on next week's post, and then I'm like, "Oh, let me just go check Twitter or maybe tweet something and that'll be fun," and then totally check my email. "Oh, inbox zero. Let's get all the way to zero. Oh, that's cool. Okay, now the days are over."

Nir Eyal (00:14:28):
Exactly. And by the way, we are cut from the same cloth. This is exactly the pattern I used to get into and I knew I wasn't doing my best because I wasn't putting in the time to the things that were most important. I was doing just what was easy and what was urgent and that's not good enough. So, if we use this model, step number one is master the internal triggers. So, for you, Lenny, so when you say, "Okay, I know I've got to do this big important thing, but now I'm going to go check email," I would guess that there's some kind of underlying emotion that you're trying to escape. Let's put yourself in the shoes that you were in when you said, "I was going to do that big important thing, but now I'm going to check email instead." Do you remember the last time that happened, by the way?

Lenny (00:15:11):
Every morning.

Nir Eyal (00:15:13):
Every morning. This morning?

Lenny (00:15:15):
Yeah, this morning.

Nir Eyal (00:15:16):
Okay, perfect. Do you recall what you were feeling right before you went to Twitter or checked email or did the thing that you didn't want to do as opposed to the thing you said you were going to do?

Lenny (00:15:27):
I don't know if this is an emotion or feeling, but there's just this, I need to get serious and start using my brain and there's going to be this deep work moment where I just get real deep and it takes a lot of effort to push me into that. Sometimes easier, sometimes harder. So, maybe it's avoiding this, "Oh, okay, I'm going to really have to think." It's like, I guess, it's the fear of the brain starting to really have to work.

Nir Eyal (00:15:51):
Yeah, that's hard work. So maybe, it's a bit of laziness. Maybe, it's a bit of momentum. There's this uncomfortable feeling of this cold start problem. "Oh, I don't really want to do it right now." So, this is incredibly important and I appreciate your candor here around what you feel because all of us experience it and we don't want to talk about it. We want to think that it's, "Oh, I'll just grayscale my phone," or, "I'll just turn off notifications and that's going to solve the problem," and it never does. And let me tell you, I tried all of it. I went to Alibaba and I bought myself one of these flip phones from China like we used to have in the 1990s with no apps, no internet connection, and then I got myself a word processor off of eBay, so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff.

(00:16:33):
And even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, "Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in," or, "Let me just clean off my desk real quick," or, "You know what? I should take out the trash." And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions. It's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, "Wait a minute, it's just a feeling." It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.

(00:17:27):
So, let me give you one tool that I use every single day. Feel free to use it next time you feel this same problem. It's called the 10-minute rule, and this is just one of a dozen different techniques that you can use that I put in the book, but this is one that I use almost every single day. So, for me, I've been a professional writer now for over a decade, and writing is never easy. I hear people say like, "Oh, just form a writing habit." I think that's ridiculous. I don't know what they're talking about. A habit is defined as a behavior done with little or no conscious thought. I don't know how to write out of habit. Writing is always hard. Fricking work. I've written two bestsellers, thousands of articles and let me tell you, it's always difficult. It's hard, and all I want to do when I write is just Google this one thing or let me just check the news real quick or let me just do anything but the actual writing. So, here's what I do.

Lenny (00:18:15):
By the way, there's a great quote that I'll share real quick about this that I think I share often on this podcast that I think it's falsely attributed to Hemingway, but it's that, "Writing is easy. Just sit down at the keyboard and bleed."

Nir Eyal (00:18:27):
Oh my God, that's so true. It's so true, and I've not figured out how to make it suddenly easy. Every single word is hard to type out, but I got to do it right and I love doing it. I love having done it. In the process, it's very difficult. But after I make the discovery, after I create something that I think is useful, then it's a lot of fun. But doing the work is really difficult. So, here's what I do. Every time that I am tempted to go do something else, which is all the time, what I will do is I will take out a timer, I'll take out my phone and I'll say, "Set a timer for 10 minutes." I'll put the phone down and my job is for those 10 minutes, whenever I'm ready, get back to the task at hand or do what's called surf the urge.

(00:19:12):
Surfing the urge acknowledges that these emotions are like waves. They crest and then they subside. But that's not how we think about emotions. Most of us think about emotions as always being there. If I feel bored, I feel like I'm always going to be bored. If I'm frustrated, it feels like I'm always going to be frustrated, but that's never the case. Emotions are like waves. So, your job is to set that timer for 10 minutes and realize you can do just about anything for just 10 minutes. So, the idea is not to say don't do it. We know that this technique that a lot of people use of abstinence, telling yourself, "Don't do that, that's bad," actually can backfire. And we can talk about the psychology if that's interesting of why abstinence backfires. But a much healthier technique is not to tell yourself no. It's to tell yourself not yet.

(00:19:57):
You're not saying no, you're saying not yet. And so, you can do just about anything for 10 minutes. So, what I tell myself is, "Okay, I'm just going to wait 10 minutes before I check email, before I scroll social media, before I Google something that is just trying to procrastinate doing the work." I can do that. I'm a grown man. I can do whatever I want. I can do that in 10 minutes. And so, for those 10 minutes, all I have to do is either get back to the task at hand, get back to writing, or surf the urge, which is simply experiencing that sensation, acknowledging, "You know what? This is hard work. That's okay. That's why I'm feeling frustrated. That's why I'm feeling bored. That's why I'm feeling anxious. That's why I have this cold start around I don't really want to do this work because it's difficult."

(00:20:34):
So, what I do is I take a deep breath and I repeat a mantra that I made up for myself. You can make up your own mantra. My personal mantra whenever I feel this internal trigger is I remind myself this. I say, "This is what it feels like to get better. This is what it feels like to get better." And just saying that for as long as I need to until that emotion crests and subsides and then get back to work. What you'll find nine times out of 10 is that by the time those 10 minutes are up, you will have forgotten about that sensation. You'll be right back at the task at hand. And so, that's what's called the 10-minute rule. And of course what you're doing over time is that the 10-minute rule can become the 12-minute rule, can become the 20-minute rule, and most importantly, you are proving to yourself that you have agency that you said you were going to focus on a task and you did. That's the most important part.

(00:21:22):
The flip that we need to change in people's minds is this ridiculous belief that technology is hijacking our brains. There's nothing we can do about distraction that our focus is being stolen. It's not being stolen, we're giving it away. And so, what we need to do is to empower ourselves by showing ourselves in practice as well as in theory that we can postpone that distraction when we say we will.

Lenny (00:21:46):
What I like about this is one, it's kind of like the Pomodoro technique, but it's shorter. The 10 minutes I think is a really clever tweak versus 20 minutes, which a lot of people recommend. And then I guess a couple of follow-up questions. Do you do this one time in the morning and then not come back to it? Is this like a jump start for the day and then you start... If I start a thing like this, it won't be 10 minutes, it'll be like an hour because I'm like, "Okay, I did the hard thing, I'm into it. I'm just going to keep working." So, is this like a jump start for the morning or do you come back to this throughout the day?

Nir Eyal (00:22:13):
So, you can do it whenever you find yourself slipping off track. And so, the Pomodoro is a version of this. I don't think it's complete enough because Pomodoro just said, "Set the timer, do it." Okay, fine. And that's great if it works for you. By the way, anything I'm saying right now, if the thing is working for you, if your life is awesome and you're doing what you said you're going to do, maybe this isn't the podcast. Maybe my book isn't the book for you, right? I'm talking to the people who, for whatever reason, you know you're capable of more, you know you're drifting off track. Maybe if like me, you said you were going to exercise but you didn't or you said you're going to eat right, but you don't. You said you were going to work on that big task, but you procrastinate. That's really who I was and that's who I wrote this book for.

(00:22:49):
And so, you can use that technique whenever you get distracted. It's not the whole picture. So, it's super important. Remember we talked about those four steps. This is just step number one. There's about a dozen different things you can do. Maybe this particular 10-minute rule doesn't work for you, doesn't work for everyone. There might be other techniques you use. So, there's dozens of different techniques just about this step around mastering internal triggers. But the next step to answer your question of well, how long do I go for? Do I do it for an hour? If now, I'm in the zone? And my answer is emphatically no. You don't go as long as you think you can. What you want to do, and this is step number two, is you're making time for traction by turning your values into time, which means you are going to make a time box schedule because you cannot call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from.

(00:23:39):
I'll say that again. You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from. So, for me, at least, when I would succumb to, "Oh, let me just check email for a quick minute, let me just see what's happening on Twitter for a quick minute," part of that was because I would justify to myself, "Well, this is a work-related task. I got to do it sometime," and there wasn't a specific time to do it on my calendar, so I would keep thinking, "Well, I got to do it sometime. Might as well just do it now." And that's a huge mistake because if you can't look at your calendar and say, "Oh, that's traction." Okay, check email, write the blog post, post the podcast, go on social media. If that's not what's written in your calendar, if it's not there, it's a distraction. And so, it's not just work-related stuff. I literally have time in my calendar, spend time with my daughter, go on social media, watch Netflix. It's in my calendar. So now, I took what was previously distraction and I turned it into traction by putting it on my schedule.

Lenny (00:24:37):
So, you actually do this through the day you have, "I'm going to check Twitter during this time of the day, I'm going to hang out with my daughter during this time of the day."

Nir Eyal (00:24:44):
Exactly. And you're adjusting it never in the day. So, you never want to do that. You always want to make sure you're doing it the day before. And so, what I do once a week, Sunday evenings, it takes me maybe 10 minutes a week. 8:00 P.M., I sit down, I look at my schedule for the week ahead and I ask myself, "Does this schedule reflect my values?" What are values? Values are attributes of the person you want to become. I'll say it again. Values are attributes of the person you want to become. So, there's three life domains, you, your relationships, and finally your work. So, what you got to do is you look at your calendar for the week ahead and you ask yourself, "How would the person I want to become spend time taking care of themselves?" That's the you domain. If you can't take care of yourself, you can't take care of others, you can't make the world a better place.

(00:25:26):
So then, you put in your calendar how you want to take care of yourself. What might that include? Well, time for rest. We all know how important sleep is, but I used to yell at my daughter and say, "Oh, it's your bedtime. You got to get to bed." And then one day she said to me, "Daddy, do you have a bedtime?" She was absolutely right. I was a hypocrite because I know how important sleep is and I didn't have a bedtime. Now, I have a bedtime. It's in my schedule. Then put in time for whatever else is important to you. Is reading important to you? Is prayer important to you? Is meditation, is exercise, is video games, is that important to you? Great. Whatever's important to you according to your values, put it in your schedule. Then you're going to put your relationships in. So, don't let the relationships in your life get whatever scraps of time are left over.

(00:26:08):
Put time in your schedule for your significant other, for your kids, for your buddies. How many of us are trapped in this loneliness epidemic because we don't make time for our closest relationships, including adult friendships? Don't let those wither away. Put time in your schedule for those, as well. We know that most friendships, they don't die in some big blowout. Relationships starve to death because we don't invest in them. Put time in your schedule for those relationships. We can talk about how to do that, as well. Then finally, the work domain involves two kinds of work. We have what's called reactive work and reflective work. Reactive work, reacting to notifications, reacting to emails, reacting to taps on the shoulder from your colleagues. That's going to be part of everybody's day. I get that, but don't let that be your entire day because what most people do, they habituate into not wanting to think.

(00:26:56):
They don't want to think what's important. "So, just let me look at my email inbox. My email inbox will tell me what to do. What's really important for my business? That's really hard. I don't really want to think about that. I'll look at my to-do list and I'll start ticking off easy tasks to do that make me feel productive." That's terrible. What you want to do instead is to book time in your schedule for this reflective work time, which is where you do the kind of work that requires you to work without distraction. Planning, strategizing, thinking, for god's sakes, can only be done without distraction. So, that fills up your calendar, as well. And what you're going to find, that there's never enough time for everything, which is good because what this forces you to do, and this is one of the main reasons why to-do lists suck, is because to-do lists have no constraints.

(00:27:38):
You can always add more to a to-do list. You can always add more, but here's what happens. This is what happened to me. I would get home from work. I have a very busy day and I'd look at my to-do list and it's a hundred items long and I think, "Wow, I've been working real hard all day and look at all this stuff I still didn't do. Loser." And so, day after day, week after week, month after month, I was reinforcing this self-image as someone who doesn't know how to manage their time. And then I started saying stupid stuff like, "Oh, maybe I'm no good at time management. Maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD. Maybe there's something wrong with me." There's nothing wrong with me. There's something wrong with this very stupid to-do list method, which doesn't force you to understand that there are trade-offs that you have to prioritize properly and that can only be done with constraints and that constraints come from your calendar.

(00:28:23):
So, you're turning your values into time by making time for traction and having this calendar and then, only then you can look at your calendar and say, "Ah, whatever it is I plan to do, that's traction. Everything else is distraction."

Lenny (00:28:36):
I want to share a couple things that worked for me that are very much along these lines. One is booking. I call it deep work time within the day. This was the only thing I had in the calendar, so I didn't do the other things, which I think would've been really helpful, but I had a, I called it deep work time. I will slap you if you book anything over this meeting.

Nir Eyal (00:28:36):
I love it.

Lenny (00:28:55):
And I did that every Monday morning, Wednesday morning, and Friday sometime, and on that...

Nir Eyal (00:28:59):
Who was slapping you?

Lenny (00:29:01):
I would be slapping the person that booked time over that slot and nobody can...

Nir Eyal (00:29:05):
Okay, got it.

Lenny (00:29:06):
And I don't know if that's allowed these days. I don't know how this...

Nir Eyal (00:29:10):
Depends who you're booking with, I guess.

Lenny (00:29:11):
Yeah, make it a little less aggressive maybe. But that worked a ton. It was like a two- or three-hour block of deep work time and that made a big dent in my ability to have time to focus because people weren't booking me as a PM.

Nir Eyal (00:29:23):
Yeah, I love it. And by the way, I want to hear more of these, but that illustrates a really good point that when the stakes are high enough, I hear people a lot of times saying, "I just can't find the time to focus and I can't get this done and it's impossible these days." And then I say, "Well, let's make a little wager here." Let's say, I get this around physical fitness a lot or somebody says, "Oh, I want to be an author. How do I do that? How do I write the book? I can't seem to find the time." And they constantly say why They can't, they can't, they can't. "There's this constraint. My boss wants this. My kids want that." They have every kind of excuse. And then I say, "Okay, let's say that if you don't work out, 8:00 A.M. Monday morning, if you don't work out, you're going to have to pay me $10,000. Are you going to do it? Are you going to work out?"

(00:30:03):
"Well, of course, I'm going to work out. Easily. Yes, of course." Okay, so we've established you can. Now, we're just negotiating the price. So, this has to do with step four around making pacts, making what's called a pre-commitment, and one of them is a price pact. This is how I got in shape. I used to be clinically obese. Today, I'm in the best shape of my life, partially because I use these pacts. Now, the important thing is you have to do this last. If you don't figure out the internal triggers, most importantly, if you don't make time for traction in your schedule, if you don't hack back the external triggers, this fourth step won't work. But as the last line of defense, it's incredibly impactful and we can talk about how to do that, as well.

Lenny (00:30:39):
I heard the all-in guys did this to lose weight. I think Sax and Jason did a pact, too. I think it was a lot of money, a hundred thousand dollars or something wild for...

Nir Eyal (00:30:49):
Oh, that's awesome. Actually, that's what I used to finish this book, as well. Maybe they read my book, I wonder, because I talked about this exact situation.

Lenny (00:30:55):
You hit it. It sounds like. You made it.

Nir Eyal (00:30:57):
I did? Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:00):
Another trick I'll share that I found useful around the to-do list. So, I used to-do lists, but I've learned that I can't just let them grow is when I had a regular job. I wrote it down in a notebook and every morning, I rewrote the to-do list so that it reminded me like, "Okay, I've copied this thing 10 times now. I'm not going to do it. I'm just going to push it out." So, that act of just rethinking about it every day was really impactful. But that works for people that are okay with an analog to-do list. If it's digital, that doesn't go away.

Nir Eyal (00:31:29):
So, I just want to clarify, there's nothing wrong with taking things out of your brain and putting them on a piece of paper. That's wonderful, but that's step one. And so, the big mistake that people make is they put stuff on their to-do list and then they wake up in the morning and what are they supposed to do? "Well, I'll do whatever's on my to-do list." And so, what they tend to do is the easy stuff. I've known people, I hate to tell you, I used to do this myself, too. I would do a task and then forget to put it on my to-do list. So, I would go back in and write it on my to-do list just so I could check off the box. How messed up is that? It's ridiculous. And I think this is something that I think really does need to change is that we have this culture where checking stuff off your list is our little emotional reward, right?

(00:32:12):
But that's ridiculous. We need to stop measuring ourselves by how many cute little boxes we check off. And rather, a much more important metric is not, "Did I finish the task?" I don't want you to track, "Did I finish?" That's not the important part, but people are probably scratching their heads. What do you mean? Isn't it all about finishing what I have to do? No, the important part is figuring out your productivity. It's figuring out how efficient you are at using your time. So, a much more beneficial metric to track is not, "Did I check off the box? Did I finish?" Rather, it's, "Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?" I'll say it again. "Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?"

(00:32:53):
Because that is the only way to understand how long things take you. The problem with to-do lists is that there is no feedback loop, there's no feedback mechanism. How long do things take you? So, this is why you have what's called the planning fallacy with people who use to-do lists, which says that on average, studies have found that tasks take people three times longer to finish than they estimate. Why does that happen? Because when you say, "Okay, here's that thing on the to-do list. I'm going to work on that and see how long it takes me to get it done." So, you work on it for five minutes and then you get an email and then you get a notification and then you start talking to one of your colleagues and you never actually track how long that thing took you to finish, as opposed to when you say, "Look, I'm going to work on that task for as long as I said I would, but without distraction. That's it. That's all I'm going to do."

(00:33:39):
What you now have is a metric of how far you got. So, I worked on that presentation, it needs to be 30 slides long, and I worked on it for 30 minutes and I finished two slides. Okay, great. Well now, I know that I need 10 more of those time boxes to finish the entire task. And this is why it turns out that people who measure themselves the way I espouse of people who say, "I'm just going to measure myself based on, did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction regardless of whether I finished," the kicker here is they actually finish more. They get more done than the to-do list people because now, they understand how long things take them to finish and they can appropriately time that as opposed to what most of us did.

(00:34:20):
What I used to do before I wrote Indistractable was procrastinate, procrastinate, procrastinate. "Oh crap, I got to get this done. The deadline's here, so I'm going to work all night to finish it," and of course, that's not when you do your best work and it's very stressful.

Lenny (00:34:31):
Since you mentioned deadlines, do you have any advice lessons on that as a tool to get things done?

Nir Eyal (00:34:36):
What we find is that people who are very deadline motivated, they do finish what they say they're going to do, but of course, the quality is crap. They're typically getting by by the skin of their teeth, and I did this all the time. This is my entire college career and my MBA at Stanford career was waiting, waiting, waiting, and then finishing at the last moment. And I could do well enough, but of course, I could do so much better if I worked without distraction. And so, it wasn't until, and we all know this basically, right? We know that putting in a little bit of diligent effort, a little bit at a time with plenty of lead time is going to give us a much better result than cramming at the last minute. But the reason people don't do this is because they don't understand how important it is, one, to manage those internal triggers.

(00:35:22):
If you're constantly thinking, "Ugh, that project is going to suck. I don't really want to work on it. I don't want to make those sales calls. I don't want to make that presentation. I don't want to do that thing that feels uncomfortable," and you don't have the tools to deal with that discomfort, you're always going to procrastinate because fundamentally, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem. It's not a character flaw. There's nothing wrong with you, you're not broken. It's just that you don't have the tools to deal with emotional discomfort and that's the part that everybody skips over. So, we don't want to talk about these uncomfortable feelings, but that's where it has to start. And then, the part that people don't do is actually planning out not the task itself, but the time to work on the task without distraction. That's the part that if you can implement that step two that I talked about of making time for traction, that becomes a game changer.

Lenny (00:36:08):
So, I've tried things like this where it's here throughout the day, I'm going to try this, I'm going to do this and this, and I just don't end up doing it. Things come up or I just get distracted. I'm like, whatever. I guess one question is how often do you find yourself doing the things you set out in your calendar? And then two, any other advice for actually staying on track and doing things you set out to?

Nir Eyal (00:36:28):
Okay, so number one, did you have tools in place to deal with the discomfort? What did you do when you didn't feel it?

Lenny (00:36:32):
I did not. I did not have that surfing the wave and the ten-minute trick, and I'm curious if there's other tricks in that bucket actually, but no, I did not.

Nir Eyal (00:36:39):
Absolutely. Yeah. So, that's the most important thing and that is the most important section. That's why I put it at the front of the book because again, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, and I think this is fascinating. Personally, I really wanted to dive deep and not only understand why do we not do what we say we're going to do, but why do we do anything and everything? What is the seat of human motivation? And I think I didn't understand it properly. I think most people don't understand motivation properly. Doesn't that blow your mind? If you think about it, "I know what to do. I agree, this is what needs to get done. I just don't do it." Isn't that ridiculous? And by the way, this is not a new problem. Plato, 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher talked about this very same problem. 2500 years before the internet, before social media, before all these things that we think are so distracting online, the Greek philosopher has had the same exact problem.

(00:37:27):
This is part of the human condition. It is part of our DNA that we constantly get distracted. But to me, that's a fascinating mystery. Why is that? Well, if you look at the deeper question of why do we do anything and everything, the seat of human motivation most people think is about carrots and sticks. If you ask people, why do we do what we do? It's about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Jeremy Bentham said something similar to this. Sigmund Freud called it the pleasure principle. Neurologically speaking, it's not true. It's not true. It's not about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. It's not about carrots and sticks, but in fact, the carrot is the stick, okay? This is where I want to give you that matrix-like... Remember that scene, the Matrix, where there's that kid with a spoon and the spoon starts bending and the kid says, "Imagine there is no spoon," right?

Lenny (00:38:14):
Absolutely.

Nir Eyal (00:38:14):
Well, the carrot is the stick. What do I mean by that? We know that the only reason we do everything in anything from a neurological perspective is not about the pursuit of pleasure. It is all about the desire to escape discomfort. Everything you do, even the pursuit of pleasurable sensations, the carrot is the stick, because even wanting to feel good, craving, lusting, desire, hunger, that desire for something that feels good is itself psychologically destabilizing. The carrot is the stick. So, what that means, I think that's incredibly empowering because what that means is that whenever we don't do something, whenever we procrastinate, it's just a feeling. It's all it is. It's just a feeling. And so, when we learn those tools, it doesn't mean where I think people start intellectualizing it and thinking, "There must be something broken with me. Maybe you need a pill, maybe you need a treatment."

(00:39:07):
Chances are there's a ninety-nine percent chance, there's nothing wrong with you. It's simply that you don't have these tools. So, that's where we have to start, is absolutely understanding and applying these techniques so that when you feel that discomfort, you use that discomfort. What I found in my research writing this book is that high performers in every industry, business, the arts, sports, high performers, they feel the same internal triggers. They also feel lonely. They also feel bored. They also feel stressed. They also feel anxious, but they use that discomfort like a rocket fuel to propel them towards traction. Whereas what distractable people do, as soon as they feel uncomfortable, as soon as they feel bored, as soon as they feel lonesome, as soon as soon as they feel indecisive or stressed, boom, they're escaping it with a drink, with a click, with something to take their mind off of that discomfort. So, that has to be step number one.

Lenny (00:39:55):
That is fascinating. Basically, distraction is an emotional regulation problem. It's the way you put it. What else works in helping you manage that discomfort? We've talked about this ten-minute trick, the timer, the surfing of the urge. What else is in that bucket of things I could try when I'm just like, "Nah, I'm just going to go check Twitter. I need to work on this thing, right now."

Nir Eyal (00:40:13):
Yeah, so there's a bunch of different techniques you can use there in terms of the internal triggers. We can get into some of the more nitty-gritty techniques. There's lots and lots of them. The most important thing here though is that once you have some in your toolkit that you want to try, let's say it's a ten-minute rule, it's surfing the urge, there's re-imagining the task, the temperament, all kinds of things that you can do. The next thing is to put it on your calendar, which we talked about briefly. So, let's say you say, "Okay, I've got that time when I..." What did you say that you want to do, that you check email instead?

Lenny (00:40:40):
Start on my newsletter post for the next week, or just continue.

Nir Eyal (00:40:43):
To write it?

Lenny (00:40:44):
Yeah, write it.

Nir Eyal (00:40:46):
Okay. And did you have that in your calendar? That was part of the time punch-me-in-the-face-if-I-don't-do-it kind of thing?

Lenny (00:40:50):
That was back when I had a regular job. These days, it's just, what I used to do is my first half of the day until 3:00 is just deep work time. I called it it's-time-to-build time, and then 3:00 beyond is meetings. So, it was actually a huge block of time of focus time, but it was not subdivided by the things I wanted to do throughout the day.

Nir Eyal (00:41:10):
I see. Okay. So, step two would be putting on your calendar, "I'm going to work on writing this newsletter for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, whatever amount of time." Make it whatever is reasonable for you based on how long you think you can do it. Put that on your schedule. Okay? Step number three is hack back the external triggers. So, did you find that when you said I was going to work on writing this newsletter, was there anything in your external environment that was pinging, dinging, kids, pets, spouse, anything like that?

Lenny (00:41:38):
It's interesting that now that you say that, just that fact that only 10% of distractions are from that. So, it makes me, on the one hand, I recognize that most of the time, there's not a thing pulling me to Twitter, LinkedIn, or whatever. Most of the time, it's just like, that's probably something interesting going on. But there's definitely times when I see a little badge or my little phone gets a little push or yeah, my wife's with a kid in the distance. I'm like, "Oh, let's go check out what's happening there."

Nir Eyal (00:42:02):
Yeah. So, that's where we want to hack back. So, the reason I use the term hack. To hack something is to gain unauthorized access. Someone hacks into your bank account or hacks into your database. We know that these technologies are gaining unauthorized access to our attention span when they're constantly pinging and dinging us. So, there's some very simple things you can do. Setting a schedule in advance so that your device turns off as it goes to do-not-disturb during certain times of the day or before you begin this task, before you start writing, you make sure to turn on do-not-disturb, so that there's nothing in your way. On my desktop, I have a do-not-disturb set from midnight to 11:59 all the time. It's constantly on do-not-disturb because I don't want these constant notifications disturbing me when I'm doing focus work.

(00:42:52):
So, making sure that that's on. When it comes to, many of us work from home today, so making sure that your family knows when the time is that you are indistractable. And I'll give you one tip. I know you have a baby at home, but soon, that baby is going to be a toddler. And so, one thing that we did in my household is that my wife went to Amazon and she got what we call the concentration crown. And the concentration crown is just this little wreath thing that she wears. It looks like a little princess thing. It has little LED lights. It lights up. There's a picture of it in the book. And when my daughter was only six years old, we told her, "Look, whenever mommy is wearing the concentration crown, that means that she can't be interrupted and she will be with you within 30 minutes."

(00:43:37):
So, her time block was always no more than 30 minutes. So, we said, "We will be with you within 30 minutes. Please don't interrupt unless you're bleeding. Okay? If you're bleeding, you can interrupt us, but unless you're bleeding," this is when my daughter was only six years old. She could find something to do. It's okay for kids to be bored time to time, but as long as mommy was wearing the concentration crown that told her, and by the way, me, as her significant other, as her husband, worked really, really well because I would always interrupt her and say, "Hey Julie, can I ask you this one thing?" And she was working on her computer, but I didn't know whether she was listening to a podcast or a video or doing work that needed concentration. So, hacking back those external triggers, making sure that they don't gain unauthorized access by interrupting the interruption, whether it's with your kids, your colleagues.

## Transcript

Will Larson (00:00:00):
I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, "Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work." Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. And so actually one of the, I think, highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this kind of baseline assumption of like, "Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems." And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Today, my guest is Will Larson, one of the most requested guests I've had on this podcast. Will is currently CTO at Carta. He's been a software engineering leader at Stripe, Uber, and Calm. He's the author of two essential books for all engineers, An Elegant Puzzle and Staff Engineer, and he's releasing his newest book The Engineering Executive's Primer in February of next year. He also publishes regularly on his blog at lethain.com, which is a must read for every engineer and eng leader.

(00:01:05):
In our conversation, Will shares advice on developing your engineering strategy and strategy in general, how to improve the relationship between an eng manager and a PM, how he finds time to write, while also working an intense full-time job, how he recommends approaching measuring engineering productivity, how to develop your company values, an amazing story about his time at Digg and so much more. Will is such a gem of a human and leader and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Will Larson after a short word from our sponsor.

(00:01:39):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX, a platform for measuring and improving developer productivity. DX is designed by the researchers behind frameworks such as Dora, Space and DevEx. If you've tried measuring developer productivity, you know that there are a lot of basic metrics out there and a lot of ways to do this wrong. And getting that full view of productivity is still really hard. DX tackles this problem by combining qualitative and quantitative insights, giving you full clarity into how your developers are doing.

(00:02:07):
DX is used by both startups and Fortune 500 companies, including companies like Twilio, Amplitude, eBay, Brex, Toast, Pfizer, and Proctor and Gamble. To learn more about DX and get a demo of their product, visit their website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.

(00:02:28):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing it. Another date conversion edge-case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences.

(00:03:02):
From embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error online 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.

(00:03:36):
Will, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Will Larson (00:03:40):
Thank you so much. Super, super excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:42):
So many people have suggested that I bring you on this podcast. You have a lot of fans out there and I am excited to be digging into engineering topics, which we don't do enough of on this podcast. So thank you for making time for this.

Will Larson (00:03:54):
No, thanks. I hope to be a good early engineering guest before you pivot entirely to engineering at some point in the future.

Lenny (00:04:04):
Wow, I love that. How cool would that be? I was an engineer actually when I started my career. How interesting would that be if we come full circle? Anyway, I thought it'd be fun to start with just what is changing in engineering? It feels like there's been a lot that has changed over the past few years, especially from kind of the ZIRP zero interest rate era to today's market, which is very different. What have you seen most change from an engineer's perspective and then just also what are you telling eng leaders about how to handle all this change?

Will Larson (00:04:32):
I think it's a pretty strange time in the market. So I think that I started working and right before the 2008 kind of crash. And so the first two years there were not so good. When I joined Yahoo, there was a layoff basically every four months. There was a layoff of some sort. It's pretty chaotic. But then we got into the last decade and it was just smooth. So numbers went up, revenue went up, headcount went up and people started learning how to build really large teams.

(00:05:02):
People started learning how to hire a lot. When I was at Uber, some days I would do six interviews back to back. I would just be in a conference room and at some point you can't even remember who you're talking to because you talk to so many people, one after another after another. You just have some scrambled notes you're trying to decode afterwards.

(00:05:20):
Pretty different now. A lot of engineering managers are spending half their time or more hiring 18 months ago and now they're doing two interviews a month or less. Maybe zero interviews a month. So there's a real shift in just the amount of time people are putting into hiring. Instead, all these different competencies that have become more critical or a really great engineering director might've just been spending their time hiring really well and that could be a top performer and now that person can't actually demonstrate what they're great at.

(00:05:51):
So that person might be perceived as a low performer if they're not also figuring out how to lead the team, getting deeper into the details and also sometimes getting into the figuring out what is the right allocation, what is the right sizing of the engineering teams, this is stuff that we weren't talking about much or maybe if you really pissed off the CEO, maybe an infrastructure you just grew a little bit slower next year, but different ballgame at this point where teams are actually disappearing, teams are getting cut down, teams are getting consolidated. And that's just something that we've avoided for that ZIRP era that now we become a core part of a lot of the job.

Lenny (00:06:27):
It feels like also engineers... They used to have a lot of leverage over companies, inside companies. I imagine that's also changing in a big way.

Will Larson (00:06:37):
I think that's true. I think this actually has been bad for engineers in some way. One of my hobby horses is that I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, "Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work."

(00:06:53):
Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. Actually one of the, I think ,highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this baseline assumption of like, "Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems." And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well. That's a highlight for me and the shift recently.

Lenny (00:07:18):
I have definitely worked with that and experienced that where you don't want to piss off engineers. And so are you saying that because that's changing, leaders maybe don't have to worry as much about upsetting engineers plus you just generally think we shouldn't treat engineers that way?

Will Larson (00:07:33):
Yeah, I think a little bit of both, but I think there's been, in this previous era, where hiring and retention were one of the biggest ways you evaluated middle management. Losing team members was huge, huge issue. And so you started to coddle a little bit, which is actually bad, again, bad for the engineers, bad for the teams, bad for everyone, bad for efficiency of the organization. But now something that I love is we get to give engineers real hard problems and we get to actually hold them accountable. And that means we can put them in senior roles.

(00:08:07):
One of the things that I've been pushing on, I wrote my last book, Staff Engineer about what is the career path for senior engineers. One of the challenges is if we aren't comfortable holding engineers accountable because we just want to retain all the engineers, then we can't put them in senior roles. And so I think we're actually seeing a bit of a shift where we can actually hold them accountable, which means we can put them in senior roles, which means the engineers can actually get what they've been trying to get the entire time, but we haven't been able to because we've been coddling them a little bit too much.

Lenny (00:08:33):
Okay. So there's a few directions I want to go and I'm just going to poke around and see where we go. The first is you're a big advocate of systems thinking. We were chatting about this before. I think a lot of people have heard this term systems thinking and there's books about it. It's sounds great. I want to be a systems thinker. What does that actually mean? How do you find you apply it in your work? How do people get better at this way of thinking?

Will Larson (00:08:57):
A lot of the least successful but smartest people I've worked with were really strong systems thinking advocates. And so I do want to say every kind of framework has a lot of downsides. There's no framework that people can apply consistently, universally, and get good results. And so briefly on this one, what I see is often people will find a spot where their system and reality are in conflict and they'll be like, "Reality is wrong." And so what's a concrete example?

(00:09:28):
At Stripe, we worked on incident management. And so Stripe pretty important company where our API is available. If the API is down, you lose money and if you lose a lot of money, you leave Stripe because you're pretty upset about that. The number one thing businesses need to do is to collect money successfully for the service that they're selling, right? Stripe is super important.

(00:09:49):
And so we did a lot of analysis on incidents trying to understand why things weren't working, what we could do better, but we got so caught up in the analysis that we lost track of whether we're actually improving things. And it took us a while to figure that out because we were so stuck in the systems thinking model and it's not like, "Oh, the team was wrong." It's like, "I was wrong." I was caught up in that model myself, to realize like, "Hey, we weren't actually prioritizing improvements, we were just prioritizing measurement." And you can't keep measuring. There's measure twice, cut once. Sure, but you don't measure infinite times and never get to cut.

(00:10:25):
And you do have to cut at some point to actually make impact. But we just got caught a little bit there. I think a lot of people who get too far in systems thinking make the same mistake where they think reality is wrong and reality is never wrong. Reality is always right. Your model is always wrong if it's in conflict with reality. But that conflict, that gap is really interesting and that's where you can learn.

(00:10:49):
And so I had this model. It's really clean. It represents your hiring pipeline that moving through different steps. It represents your incidents and how you remediate incidents. It can model almost anything pretty quickly when you get good at it. And then understanding how reality is in conflict with that, you start to understand where your mental model is wrong and then you can go educate yourself and improve the model and just keep doing that.

(00:11:12):
At some point the model is close enough and you can stop doing that and go actually do the work. So that the biggest thing I tell people is this is a great way to learn, but you also have to do things. You can't just learn. That's not our entire job.

Lenny (00:11:25):
To make it a little more concrete, how would you best describe this idea of systems thinking? What's a good way to just like, "Okay. I get what you're talking about?"

Will Larson (00:11:32):
This is probably a better place to start versus a rambling anecdote about using it.

Lenny (00:11:38):
We can go backwards. It'll be great.

Will Larson (00:11:41):
Systems thinking is basically you try to think about stocks and flows. So stocks are things that accumulate and flows are kind of the movement from a stock to another thing. So what's a simple example of a stock? A stock could be the number of fish in a lake. A stock could be the number of people fishing in a lake. And so a flow between those two could be the number of fish in a lake will decrease at some rate based on the number of people fishing in that lake.

(00:12:08):
So if there's a ton of fishers, the stock of fish will go down faster. There's only a couple of fish, IT will go down slower. But also then there's these flows which kind of dictate that where if we've got much more efficient fishermen, the flow of fish out might go down, but also the fish do reproduce. So then there's another flow going back. So based on the current number of fish and the reproduction rate, the current number of fishers and their fishing rate, you start to see how these can evolve over time. And a lot of this.

(00:12:38):
So first always recommend Thinking In Systems by Donella Meadows. Really phenomenal book. And a lot of her work is also kind of referencing the work in Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, which talks about how small amount of carcinogens or something low in the ecosystem or the food chain rather as they get consumed by predators further and further up get concentrated. And that's a kind of a classic systems thinking problem to think about where you wouldn't think a small amount of carcinogens and a small fish actually matter. But as they go up the food chain, they start to concentrate it and an unexpected change can happen.

Lenny (00:13:14):
So then going back to your example of the hiring pipeline, let's come back to that to help connect this definition, which I've never heard, which is awesome, very clear to how you actually implemented say in hiring.

Will Larson (00:13:23):
The first thing to do is to get a model out there of any sort. And so you think about your stocks. And so in a hiring pipeline you might have potential candidates and this could be basically infinite, and then you have a couple of inflows. So you could have sourced, you could have outreach, you could have referrals, and then you have the candidates and those... How many people get sourced. There's probably a function of number of sources you have dedicated to a role. So you'd have another stock of how many sources you have and then that would impact the rate going from potential candidates to actual candidates you've sourced.

(00:13:59):
And then from candidates that you have in that box, you'd have a conversion rate for people who pass the first recruiter screen and that would move into step two of your process. And then from step two you have maybe a hiring manager screen and that would be another conversion rate. So you can see over time how the candidates of the infinite potential candidates like wandering around LinkedIn, posting about their deep thoughts, convert into actual people, your first, your second, your third.

(00:14:26):
But then as you get deeper into it, you start to actually see interesting things. And so for a lot of candidate or a lot of pipelines, the biggest issue is hiring managers don't want to extend any offers because the hiring managers can't get to confidence on any candidate. And you'll see in this pipeline, you'll see a ton of candidates getting to offer stage, but almost none of them converting from a potential offer to actually offer. And then you can say, "Hey, here's the problem. You need to go work with the recruiter and the hiring managers on getting conviction about who they should hire.

(00:14:56):
Classic problem with early managers, right? Here's a second problem. Manager wants to extend a ton of offers. They do extend them and none of them actually accept. And so that focuses you on the second problem. But there's a third potential world where actually you're just not getting enough candidates in. You're actually doing a great job of making decisions, great job of closing candidates. There's just not enough candidates coming in. And so by looking at this and you can build this model, then you can go to your applicant tracking system, a greenhouse or whatever and pull the historicals and you can just see how the historicals work versus how you'd expect it to work.

(00:15:32):
You can see the drop-offs and this helps you figure out where should you go try to fix things first. I think we've all worked in companies where you roll out big changes with no data behind them because like, "Oh, it feels like we're not hard enough in how we evaluate candidates or something." You go change a bunch of stuff. But often the real problem might be that the hiring managers making offer extensions to people who never passed the loop anyway. It's just the managers are issuing too many offers because they're panicking. And man, less true now, but a decade... Or not a decade, two years ago, hiring managers panicking to get offers out, that was a real thing that happened a lot. And this just helps you take a complex kind of abstract problem and turn it into something you can actually work in a systematic way.

Lenny (00:16:17):
I feel like product managers will either naturally do it things this way already because a lot of them think in funnels. And it's interesting to hear this version of it of this idea of just following the stock through the flow of the different steps. Awesome. Another thing that I know that you are very passionate about and spend a lot of time thinking about is engineering strategy. I think you have this kind of feeling like engineers don't think enough about the end strategy. Every other function has a strategy and engineers often don't. Talk about what you find there and what your advice is around that.

Will Larson (00:16:52):
First, I start to question whether any function has a strategy at most companies. My general experience is that there's very rarely a written strategy for any company. Sometimes it's a value statement. It's like we build the highest quality products and you're like, "Good. Okay. What do I do with that?" You're like, "Build a high quality product." You're like, "Okay. I don't don't know what that means."

(00:17:15):
Engineering often has this problem where I think people will make comments in their culture amp or their quarterly surveys or whatever. It's like, "Hey, the strategy is not clear or where's the engineering strategy?" And the biggest thing I tell people when they complain and then engineers complain about the product strategy. The PMs don't have any strategy or the business has no strategy. And the reality is product eng and business always have a strategy. It's just often not written down.

(00:17:45):
And so the first thing I want to do is I push people not to get caught up on the fact that there's no template out there, which is product strategy that someone has forked and filled in. It doesn't mean you don't have a strategy. You do have a strategy. It's maybe a little bit hard to articulate and maybe it's applied inconsistently across different layers of the product reporting chain because it's not written down. But it's never true that there's no product strategy. There's always a product strategy. Sometimes it's bad, but there's always one. And true for engineering as well. There's always an engineering strategy. Just sometimes it's bad.

(00:18:21):
The first rule of strategy is that if you write it down, then you can improve it. If it's not written down, it's hard to say if this PM is just not a good PM or if they're trying to apply the strategy that they've misunderstood or if they actually are correctly applying the strategy from the head of product that's just not appropriate to the problems they're working on, how do you debug any of that?

(00:18:43):
If you have a written document, even if it's not a super compelling strategy, at least you can start debugging. It's like, "Hey, the head of product should improve the clarity of this document. Hey, this DM actually isn't applying it correctly. Hey, the strategy actually isn't appropriate for this one business unit where it makes sense for the others."

(00:19:02):
So that's the first thing I think about. But the second big theme on strategy I think about is that often good strategy is so boring. It's hard to talk about. For example, on the engineering side of thing, a common strategy that's really good but very boring is we only use the tools we have today. So a lot of times you'll get engineers that want to introduce new programming languages, new databases, new cloud providers. And a really good strategy for almost all companies is like we just use the standard kit we already have today.

(00:19:39):
And at Carta, when I joined one of the engineers, Eric Vogel wrote the standard kit and that is our strategy of the tools we use. And you know what? Some people are really frustrated by that and I feel for them. It feels like they're losing control, but the power of these boring strategies is that it focuses people's energy on the problems that we value as a company. And so it is painful coming into alignment if you're kind of slightly misaligned over time, but boring strategies that tell you what actually matters and aligns you with what the company actually caress about are really good for you even if they're a little bit annoying at a time. And I can expand on this idea a lot, but I won't ramble indefinitely on it.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Well, maybe what might be helpful is what are some other examples of engineering strategies that you've seen just to give people even more just like, "Oh yeah, maybe this should be part of our strategy."

Will Larson (00:20:31):
So first, what is a definition of strategy? And the best one I've ever seen is from Richard Rumelt. He wrote Good Strategy, Bad Strategy.

Lenny (00:20:40):
He's coming on the podcast.

Will Larson (00:20:42):
Amazing. He also wrote, The Crux I think came out this year sometime, which I also read. I think both great and just a phenomenal thinker who has so much depth. I think one of the challenges of writing about strategy is you're like, I've seen two things and I write the book, but I think the thing that's impressive about Richard Rumelt is he's seen so many different scenarios that he's able to really operate from both the particular but also the general and dataset in a really interesting way. Another book with similar characteristics is How Big Things Get Done by... I forget the authors, but really amazing dataset of how mega projects kind of succeed and fail.

(00:21:21):
But anyway, Richard Rumelt, definition of strategy is basically three components. There's a diagnosis. What is the current status quo? What are the things that are real today? There are guiding policies which are basically based on the diagnoses, how do you want to address them? And there's actions. And actions are how are we going to implement these guiding policies. He talks a lot about actions because concerned about this idea of inert strategy where you have like, "We're going to deprecate our old product features we don't use, but no one deprecates any of them."

(00:21:52):
So he's really concerned about this non implementation kind of useless strategy that doesn't do anything. On engineering, I'm a little bit less worried about that. I think strategy is more interesting on engineering in terms of clarifying how we make future decisions. And so what are a few examples of that? At Uber, we only used our own data centers. We didn't use the cloud. And this has changed since the era I was there, but in the 2014 era, no cloud, and we had a strict no cloud policy. And this was annoying because we had to indent everything ourselves or run copies of everything ourselves.

(00:22:28):
But it also meant that we were able to spin up in China in literally three months and some surreal stories from that. We couldn't fit our racks into the data centers, so they had to take the roof off the data center and lift the racks in with the crane.

Lenny (00:22:43):
Holy shit.

Will Larson (00:22:43):
Just tons of stories and all this had done in three months and truly phenomenal. And Uber wasn't in China for very long, so in some ways you're like, we did all that just a leave? But they left with a nice stake of Didi Kuaidi and not a bad outcome overall. But I think that strategy, we run everything in data centers. We don't use the cloud, meant we were able to move in and out of different geopolitical constraints and companies that relied on cloud presence simply can't. There are fully constrained by where AWS or Google Cloud or Azure have built out. So that's one good example.

(00:23:21):
Another good example at Stripe was this idea of we run a Ruby monolith and that's what we did and that's evolved a bit since then. There's more Java and the Stripe of 2023 than there was in the stripe of 2016 or the 2012 or whatnot. But that policy really focused the engineers on building innovative features for our users rather than building different tooling to support different programming languages. And so in both cases, both the Uber policy around running our own data centers and the Stripe policy around Ruby monoliths, a lot of engineers hated these.

(00:24:02):
But the goal of good strategy is not to appease everyone. The goal of good strategy is to dictate how we invest the limited capacities we have or the limited capabilities we have into the problems we care about. And I think both of them were really effective towards that end.

Lenny (00:24:17):
A common theme across all these examples is essentially constraint, deciding we will constrain our options to move faster and focus on the things that really matter.

Will Larson (00:24:28):
In solving the constraints is to me, I think the most interesting thing that strategy really does, and I think when we talk about bad strategy usually is because the diagnosis is bad and it's usually because people are exerting what they want to be true on constraints where it's like, "Hey, we can do all of these projects at once." And often that's just not true, but it's hard to convince people that when they're the CEO or they are really committed to believing it, but almost all bad strategies basically come down from a willful disbelief of what an accurate diagnosis is, which means then your guiding policies are kind of incoherent to begin with.

Lenny (00:25:08):
Awesome. I'm excited for that episode of Richard where we're going to go real deep into strategy, but maybe just as a lasting topic around there, if someone listening wanted to get better at say end strategy specifically or a strategy in general, is there anything you recommend they do? Is it read these books? Is there anything else?

Will Larson (00:25:26):
If people want to get good at strategy, there's a lot of different types of strategy, but here are some things I'd really recommend. First, I think the Richard Rumelt book, I think Good Strategy, Bad Strategy is probably the right starting point. I think The Crux also quite good, but maybe I would read that one second. Great overview of how to think about strategy. Also Thinking in Systems, I mentioned that before related to systems thinking, a big part of strategy is being able to model the reality so we can improve your diagnosis.

(00:25:56):
So I think that one is really quite good as well. If you get into the engineering side of things, there's a lot of interesting books here. There's Technology Strategy Patterns by Evan Hewitt. There's The Value Flywheel effect by Anderson, McCann and O'Reilly. The Phoenix Project by Kim, Behr, Spafford, which is a modern rewrite of The Goal by Goldratt. But I think there's still the missing canonical book is kind of missing on this one. So I took a stab at strategy and my upcoming book, which is coming out the Engineering Executives Primer coming out early next year.

(00:26:33):
Also, took a stab at it. In staff engineer my previous book, but I still think there's a missing book here. So I am dreaming of writing an engineering strategy book for my next project, although we'll see if that actually comes together.

Lenny (00:26:48):
Well, let's actually follow that thread of writing something I was definitely hoping to chat about. You write a lot. You've written two, three, four-ish. You're writing a new book. How many books you've published? Two books and there's a third one coming up.

Will Larson (00:27:00):
So I have two books. First one with Stripe Press, the second one, self-published and the third one with the Riley coming out in two months effectively.

Lenny (00:27:08):
Okay. And then also many, many blog posts for many, many years. I asked a few people what to ask you, and this came up a lot, Gergely Orosz and Alex Xu from ‎ByteByteGo both asked just this question of just, "How do you make time to write as much as you do?" And then I also, I'll ask this too and just answer it either first or second, just what impact has writing had on your career? Why do you keep doing it?

Will Larson (00:27:37):
I feel really strongly that you can write a lot more if you write what you want to write. And so this is one of the reasons I don't write for financial gain and I don't write very much on a schedule, so I've done a few pieces for magazines, et cetera, but I find that actually really draining to be you have a topic, you have to agree on the topic. If a topic starts missing what you want to write about, you can't fix it a lot of the time and you're also on this deadline. You're like, "Ah, I'm screwing up. I need to ship this. It needs to be done tomorrow."

(00:28:12):
I just find that really draining. Conversely, when I own the schedule, when I get to write about, "Hey, I'm writing out something." So I started writing this infrastructure engineering book a couple of years ago. It just wasn't there. I just couldn't get it to come together and so I just stopped. I'm not writing it anymore. Maybe I'll come back to it at some point, but probably not.

(00:28:34):
To me, the biggest strength of writing what you want is you get to write where there's energy and you don't have to write where there's no energy, which takes you really, really negative. And this also ties into how I write books, which is that I basically write the entire thing before I start working with a publisher. And if you are, I think diligent and good at anticipating what their concerns are going to be, you can mostly reuse the content that you're trying to write. This is also easier in the sorts of books I write.

(00:29:05):
I think harder to do in a really technical introduction to MySQL or something, you can't just resequence those chapters and pretend it's going to work. Those chapters build in a different way than the sort of business book that I write does. Writing the stuff that's energizing and just giving up on the stuff that's not energizing, that's how I write a lot and how I've been writing for 16 some years. And the way I keep doing it is just by writing what's energizing and what I'm thinking about now.

(00:29:38):
I don't write what I'm not thinking about and I don't write for any audience, I just write what is interesting to me. And that means some people don't like it and that's great. That's totally fine. It's not really for them, it's for people who want to follow the ride and that's where I focus.

(00:30:55):
Okay. There's a lot more I want to dig into here. How many posts have you written do you think over the 16 years?

Will Larson (00:31:00):
I would guess about a thousand. That would roughly be my assumption. I think there are a few years where I wrote hundreds of posts, and so if you do that like three years, it's not that hard to get to a thousand from there.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's incredible, especially because you've had intense jobs for all of those years or most of those years. Very high pressure, fast growing hypergrowth companies. Somehow you find time to work. So first, let me just double click slash co-sign your advice here around paying attention to what gives you energy and working on things that you're actually curious about. This is exactly the advice I give to people. A lot of people start this full-time writer, creator life, and they're like, "What do people want? What do people want me to write about? What's popular? What's going to inspire go viral?"

(00:31:48):
And that's easy to do a couple times, but then you end up creating this job for yourself that you don't want. You don't want to be spending all your days writing about AI if you're not that excited by AI or whatever's hot these days. What I find is important is almost like 80, 90% of what you write has to be stuff you're excited about. And then maybe there's a bit of, "Here's what I know people really want. Here's what I know is going to do really well." Because otherwise you just burn out. You create a job for yourself that you don't want. Why would you do that?

Will Larson (00:32:13):
Yeah. I just a hundred percent agree with that. I think the other thing is that everyone converges on the same thing that they think people want. So it's crypto two years ago. It's like AI right now or it's counter AI. AI is going to ruin the world. It's hard to say something very novel because, one, everyone is trying to say something about it. Two, it's almost certainly not what you're that knowledgeable about where if you just stick in your lane, I think the biggest risk to writers is quitting.

(00:32:43):
A little bit like the 40-year career idea. The biggest risk to content creation of any sort is quitting soon because you get burned out. The biggest risk is not that you grow too slow initially. There's always this sense that you've missed the wave. It's too late to join Substack. The top writers are already there. You'll never be a top writer. It's too late to podcast. There's too many podcasts. You'll never make it. It's too late to join Medium. You'll never make it. There's too many Medium writers.

(00:33:11):
But it is just not true. If you just keep writing good stuff, you'll build an audience over time and you can take that audience from platform to platform. What really matters is finding something you can actually keep doing for the next decade. That's way harder than doing it for one year.

Lenny (00:33:25):
We have the same exact advice on this. This is exactly the things I tell everyone. When I joined Substack, I thought it was too late. I was like, "Man, it's over." And when I started this podcast like, "Oh man, there's a billion podcasts. How is it ever going to work?" So I so agree, and I also so agree on the fact that this whole thing is such a... It's a long game. There's a lot of people. I always say it's easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it up. Nobody actually keeps it up because people are going to come and go. The thing that really separates success from failure is just people that can keep at it. There's not an end game to this. It's an infinite game and it's about being able to sustain that over the long term.

Will Larson (00:34:04):
You're not competing with other content creators. If you think of it as an infinite game, you're all working together. You can all help each other grow. There's no maximum number of product writers or thinkers who can be doing something. You're not less successful because [inaudible 00:34:22] exists or something like that. There's no competition there. It's like a false, false dichotomy.

Lenny (00:34:27):
Yeah. I totally agree with that. Unless there's so many and then all of a sudden what happens is the bar just gets higher, which is good because then people get better stuff and that's fine. That's happening anyway. Just the bar continues to increase because there's more and more content out there. And to me that's the ultimate thing you got to get right is just the bar. You just got to be at a high bar for anyone to care about anything you're writing about. And to your point, to do that well, you have to actually be excited about writing about it and have background and have something to contribute.

(00:34:59):
I'm just ranting here, but the way I think about this is you need to add something new to the conversation for anyone to pay attention because there's so much fluffy, superficial stuff. And to get anyone to care is you need to say something new that no one's heard before or share new information they haven't seen anywhere else.

Will Larson (00:35:15):
I totally agree. I could keep ranting about this for the entire time. I don't want to derail on this, but I totally agree.

Lenny (00:35:23):
We'll control ourselves. So then getting very tactical, I think this is what a lot of people are always wondering, how do you make time? What's your workflow? How do you make time for writing so that you keep at it with knowing you have an intense full-time job?

Will Larson (00:35:34):
I used to do things differently before I had a kid, so I have a three and a half year old and just timing your life just really shifts a lot once you have kids. But the biggest thing that I found is finding things to write about that also directly relate to what I'm working on. And this is where I can do something that helps me at work and helps me write at the same time because I think it's incredibly hard to find time to write about stuff that has nothing to do with your work.

(00:36:05):
And this distracts you from your work because these... Particularly if you're in a senior role, these can be pretty demanding jobs, but they're not demanding because you're responding to an urgent DM on Slack every five or six minutes. They're demanding because you need to make some really difficult decisions really well. And I think writing about related topics is a great way to refine your thinking and improve your performance. It's not like a conflict or you do one.

(00:36:34):
You either write or you do your job well. I think you can find a way to align. And so a lot of podcast folks do interviews with folks who are related to what they're thinking about at work, and that's a great way for them to learn, build their network, to refine their thinking, to test their thinking against experts in the field. It's not like in conflict with the work, it's in alignment. So that's one piece. But yeah, I've played around with my schedule a lot.

(00:36:58):
Before I had a kid, often Saturdays would be the writing day and so morning and early afternoon would just be writing. I can't do that anymore, so now I mostly write at night, which is tricky from an energy management perspective. But the biggest thing I would say is just if you're actually excited about something, you will find time and energy for it. If you're not excited about it and it's 9:00 PM, you're just going to get asleep. And so I really think that this is where you have to schedule a little bit deliberately, but the first thing we talked about around energy management, they really come together. When your schedule gets tight, if you're not energized, you just won't get it done. And why would you? It just doesn't make sense.

Lenny (00:37:41):
Just to close out this thread for someone that wants to do more writing knows that it's going to be valuable, but just hasn't any one tip that you would leave them with to get on this train?

Will Larson (00:37:51):
It depends why people want to write. I tell people, if you just want to write something that is going to help advance your career, you should really focus on writing two or three really good things and spend a ton of time drafting, revising, getting feedback. You just focus on making one great artifact or two or three great artifacts. You don't need to create a long-running blog where you publish every week. There's really no need to do that if your goal is just to create some artifacts that show you're a deep thinker, that help position you in the industry.

(00:38:21):
Don't start a newsletter if you just want to advance yourself in the industry a little bit. Just write two or three really good things. So that's the first thing I'd say. But if your goal is to write a lot consistently over time, my biggest advice would be just publish. And so there's a lot of people out there with stuff that hundreds of drafts and they've not published anything. And my thing is I publish almost everything I write. If there's something that I'm not going to publish, I don't start writing it because I have a quick check in my head like is this something I can write and publish?

(00:38:56):
And if my answer was like, "No, I just don't even start." And my accuracy has gotten higher over time as I've written more, but I published pretty much everything I write. That's why some of it is not that good. And that's okay. Again, I want to write. I want to get these ideas out. I want to show what I'm focused on and my evolution as a thinker trying to learn how to operate in these different roles in these different companies. I'm not writing trying to create a polished perfect thing, and also I'm not writing to maximize a reader's experience of reading it.

(00:39:27):
Some people don't like that, and I think that's a totally reasonable thing not to, but I think what I can bring you is my experience as an operator who's actively learning and thinking through. I think that's really valuable to other operators in the industry. In terms of giving you the perfect writing, I try to do that, closer to that. I don't know if I ever hit perfect writing, but that's where my books are. The books are taking a collection of thoughts over a couple of years, cleaning them up a little bit, packaging them. They're way higher quality than my typical writing.

(00:39:56):
But yeah, I would just publish a lot. Don't worry about the quality. Sometimes people will send you silly feedback and I just don't respond to that stuff anymore. You never know why people send you something like that. I think trying to debug people you don't know is a bad use of time. It's just kind of like, "Thank you. Move on to the next. Don't even spend time worrying about it."
